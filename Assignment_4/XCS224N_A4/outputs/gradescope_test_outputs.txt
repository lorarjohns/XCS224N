So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved being loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of us making medical decisions, and in fact for decision-making decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from the benefit to a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, heart spill.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I would like to give you a drug that will help <unk> <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most active drugs in the world today.
So you say, "Yeah, you know, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or put surgery on any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number needs to be one.
My doctor didn't get me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's your fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needed to treat the most broadly <unk> which is what you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is based on the research of <unk> <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I can explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 percent of my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects is produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things that include <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so they don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that you help you help your drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is part of the informed consent principle.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to try is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the greatest men of 50, <unk> prostate prostate cancer, the number necessary to try to be <unk>
This is 30 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent are one of that <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can ask you to get the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the spot.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it turns out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> face -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't really react to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical thought, rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage damage, or to prevent things the bad thing in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor I installed a combination of combination along with the door, with a key to the gate of entry at the same time, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not quite organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite symbol of music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may be <unk> never to have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the 1980s, and with the time step of the time, it mixed with local signs, and developed the language we know today as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a country foreign in a country foreign <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
I have learned, for example.
Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
Don't <unk> and when you're eating, sure you don't get <unk> in the <unk>
All of this is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about what is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
It would be going to keep it going.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to do this with my thumb so it's not natural.
That's why I just have four lines in the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, he had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the tendency and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to become more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know so well that it's not only experienced through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, he was stuck with the amount of support and attention I had.
I realized that sound is like money, the power, the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I might be able to <unk> me and my artistic job, or I could <unk> me.
I chose me to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
And so I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary time form of value as well as taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If you won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't catch and express fully into the paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into a lot of different locations.
If you take a different <unk> for each finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and like this, while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you're just <unk> just at the same time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers of the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different means.
Same thing happens to the music in terms of tone and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> using these different parameters, <unk> can be explained different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I see the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it might be like a visual piece of music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and you put it.
This is the day."
If you put it up, and it will look at the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be called the <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night in this picture.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expressed the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present you get closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea of a very romantic idea at the same time, to get it again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think that I think about <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of them in high school.
Now we're going to do it so much in my head as the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest. But they make very different meanings together.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and rich, just like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be one step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not that you have to hear music to learn music.
<unk> is a wealthy rich, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a kid, my parents said, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the truth.
As I got older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not really good at cleaning them from others.
The country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the American school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't think about it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts to an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge boats together.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the <unk> kids can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who are using electrical tools, they feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting chunks of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
And then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we will bring up light and web cameras on ships and put it into a floating robot, moving slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board is going to process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to move it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very enlightened kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you have this picture.
A child, probably less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live in.
You can see that the water is brown the mud and the oil is also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to look at what there is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help <unk> other children.
And I was able to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear central power plant near water.
And today, according to the reports that the average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast -- and the majority of the time, it has safe it is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become <unk> every year from the accident and researching independently other scientists, the soil, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course, not the <unk> parents don't get it.
But every night you get to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And we could see that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition to the nearest central to the date.
We zoom in to 1.5 miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen help in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem with a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of little therefore, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemical biology, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all of it.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked questions like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age population transforming their standard wheelchair in new self-driving vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen scientists, creators, <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to be worried about the environment and the people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of steel, the other one string of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I believed before.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information it needed for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the <unk> of manufacturing and production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of the parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects, as <unk> of different parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with light-activated pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You acts primarily like <unk> the other primarily as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world <unk> twice as much personality of every designer and architect in working on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, of Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right, analysis and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My job, in its most simple level, trying to bring these two visions of the world, move away from assembly and getting to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where four disciplines have taken access to access designers that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large-scale arm -- like this robotic arm with a sample of 24 feet from diameter with a firm force that some day not very distant to print <unk> buildings, and graphics <unk> made in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> of the ancient Arab sector, and it has created a screen where every aperture is the only one to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion game in Paris with <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in <unk> <unk> around the waist.
Together with collaborator, 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells.
This hull combines <unk> and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner too.
That designers have access to this high resolution and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair to the comfortable structural and also absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator <unk> went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern, it becomes <unk>
We have this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality by addition to another material or another <unk> but by continually continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a Jewish house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and found a lot of what matters.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent to the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often wonder, "What would be the design if the objects were made of a single part?
It will be a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material that we would have the kind of material of the tree -- <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million metric tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or avoid <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune to their property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We did a lot of <unk> from <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the structures at a large scale, built a whole system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of just three material, long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves it dry to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were an byproduct of the printing process used to be used to contain <unk> <unk> that first first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition with no mouse issues, and if it expanded even more, to windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, and they have life <unk> and put into the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> table, we did our own <unk> table, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- new biological ecosystems within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
So we would choose our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops -- <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, you would have two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the hot <unk>
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns out the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels to the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, you don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help us to build these bacteria and to <unk> their function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we want more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches from one extreme to another, it will be 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside of your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material.
So for that, you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer is <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
A acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk silk worm started in the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small imam to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk <unk>
However, when I put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we will <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different parts -- and we have discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death in their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk engineering.
We knew that <unk> silk worms are going to be more dark and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and the heat, distributes the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit of two or three weeks, <unk> silk silk <unk> <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length length of the silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, designers should bring these two visions in the world.
What brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by the design that demands of us, for the first time, that we can take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Two. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and created websites -- also playing the guitar in a computer band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, you get to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I went through it for something else, something totally different, and I would leave me on it, and I'm going to leave me through it, and I am <unk> I have found it -- and then I found this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my own passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me as much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be densities, or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like me to put me back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you <unk> it from culture.
So you ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would look at that age.
It's considered a naive question to provoke nice answers on kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is about us and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the nice exercise of it before you take away the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, not inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does right now, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what do you cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy was <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and the <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they will have to choose them.
But it's more than that.
The notion of focused on our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for somebody like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interest and creative activities.
It's a breath out of it.
Could it help if you divide up in three parts: <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Do you have any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with an identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas in my website, is that there's huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers to go.
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests of shared interests for data visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when they started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of the only idea of his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens in the intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is very quick.
When we <unk> we are <unk>
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new zone that we have -- so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> for full time and an independent teacher.
As a teenage girl <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known thing.
Before becoming a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
It had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they were starting their practices, and this ability helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is <unk> a loss of time to get to what you would give you even if you get it to the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, another graphic pages, sometimes consultant to a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can afford to satisfy the market needs the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if you're a pressure to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a lot of interest in encouraging them to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist, and a <unk> <unk>
The acoustician can dive deep and put ideas together, and the <unk> provides a amplitude of the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part of them are told that it's just more like their fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there is one thing you can take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal unconscious, whatever it is.
If you are a heart teacher, then you get it through all the media.
That's where you give the best thing to do.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realize will be one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep your curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
It would take the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they brought them to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until she passed away from <unk>
After his death, she did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
But even more surprising one.
If you might have been alive today, we couldn't give her it more aid than the <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has come a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer to cancer, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's slightly done in treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the chance that you spend your 70s or help take care of a friend or be treated with Alzheimer's disease.
In America, cardiovascular care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in heart disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease today and its costs of five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> booms <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all of the world, Alzheimer's is the only thing you can't do to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but all the world's <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us, even the scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But it's just looking at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the comparison of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to producing a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by significantly less life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. <unk> found <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know they're made of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> points end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points will come up in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules are going <unk> each other, forming groups that can form <unk> <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the <unk> of what block is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we would get it, and then create a drug that makes it done.
Until recently, most of you have brought down the cables and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, engineers and <unk>
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when I test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, they have protein protein that you stick with each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see it <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so it grows that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk> industry.
That was essential to move into HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the victims of the hidden, caregivers of their loved ones and night, they're often too much <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience when we try to test it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are going to be done to be done by 36 questions, and then they both look at the eyes without speaking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number three: When was the last time you could go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> are increasingly personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about it, or she did very sincere this time, and I gave things that you don't have ever known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a little detail really struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the Love column, and in a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably wondering, they still do this together.
And the reason I think the challenge is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the issue.
A week before he was published the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog bill can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably about thousands of views.
And that has a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and because of Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday, I already had called the WorldWide Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing about <unk> in <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they made the same question: still follow the same question:
In fact, when I was cooking this talk, I did a quick search for my email with the sentence, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers -- like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman yelled up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put me red.
I think this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said that not every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and I would take orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons in the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked out, they wanted to know if it really happens, or if it was able to produce <unk> love, not only an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, mostly that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you were <unk> or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, and in college students, using what they would call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer after we do that, multiple studies, then we used <unk> protocol <unk> as a rapid way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used between members of the police and the community. They have been used by people of the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which is combining personal questions with four minutes of visual contact was cited in this paper, but unfortunately they never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked like it was <unk>
And I said, "You want you to tell you that you would get the person to <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> I know they had to get better after test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and it was going through a really difficult separation here.
He had had that relationship since I had 20, which was supposed to almost all of my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or she could live without him.
So I used to take it in science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just went to work for the book I was writing about, in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I was feeling then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I looked at.
But I also can see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is an assurance not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story was told about 36 questions that might have a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some ways to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says still together?
And their content with an answer of <unk> or No.
So more than a question, <unk> we ask more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love with things like this, and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably is a relationship? Or even more, how you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more controversial conversation about what means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love with it is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that that choice.
He didn't think about how many times we have to make that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and said, 36 questions, I'd have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun to have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what we're going to do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that this myth is true.
I want the happy ending of implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the chance of choosing to love someone, and hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> <unk> and in some ways, I got like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York a time ago.  Something that really struck me but more details later.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood and <unk> a dollar bill and a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment he was in <unk> <unk> like to go from ride and make <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> at Agnes Martin, I covered them from resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: somehow happened, somehow it seemed that it increased size, as if it was going to be the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
And this time, I started adding some elements of frogs to strange bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out, and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow out and draw the same way to draw the way around a <unk> <unk>
And I took up objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, they will be able to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and strangers.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of resin size with drawings of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, then in another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together together that they built a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was going to have something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animal heads are heading into the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is composed of thousands of elements.
This is a weak god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits up oil in one hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> feet long as a snake tail that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn fire to the <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> cards in 1986.
They've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> over time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each of them acts as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk in between them. I'm carrying up.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds of a human trapped inside.
This has a small cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, the entrance can <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads, and you're communicating with the two.
There are some pills that they come out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the bowl <unk>
Can you <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a <unk> <unk> a museum, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
You get the box and all the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box you are living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, which is that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion -- it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill. It's the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug medication effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the cells of cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects in its most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the blood stream and get worse and worse for the time that it takes to get into their destiny, which is where it's more important in the HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes. the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't really easily enter the blood stream of the patients that are <unk> into regular therapy with antiretroviral medicine.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "Let me get the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> from the <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it to be used for attention with wounds and surgery with diabetes -- you can be used for anything <unk> including the drug <unk>
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small, <unk> and they open up almost immediately cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little bit powerful laser beam on the cell membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser travels the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of descent.
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro <unk> or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, you go into the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug releases it directly into the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total HIV eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups -- not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not <unk>
And my goal is to understand better to these death death agents and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to a non-violent confrontation at a violent engagement.
I do business work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a <unk>
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace agreements between 1975, and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
And so we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of resolution of successful conflicts resolution.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military network.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
We put a complex machinery of communication stations stations to radio TV, TV websites.
And here you have the magazine printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising but by using business companies -- for example, business companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run in schools, they put into professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering the population that the state will not make security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn torn by the war or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> can also think about the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price for the population.
But in general, provide social services -- means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at groups -- we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill them gaps by the government, and they emerge like armed and politicians, engage in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated people are these organizations, we can less <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all its functions, they collect the trash, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak things are states, like in the Middle East today, more <unk> and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and <unk> peace.
If we understand better to groups -- we will understand better what incentive to offer to encourage the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors -- the military power can win some battles, but we won't give peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill in that security void to fill that transportation vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid they accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I would have a bad feminist box.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had a strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and that we would give sex as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women treat women all over the world and the anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in the <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is for too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe it is equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
We have the same paycheck for the same job.
We have right to travel around the world as it will be <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use an easy way and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing to controls <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have these differences and how we care about the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> feminism is not anything.
For me, these are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear music rap -- just volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women, and I got it deeply, the classic <unk> classic <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> <unk> right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical cortex.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the collection of junk and the nest <unk> and the nest <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It was <unk> from fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, and I am not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the gay workers, gay and <unk> for white women, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist in it.
Also the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we are hoping for perfection.
So when we were going to take them up with them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I think I was <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I am <unk> for fear of what it means is that <unk> <unk> not being able to meet the very unlikely expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, looking at this star star embracing the feminism and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics began endless debates if we were <unk> it was either a feminist thing.
It would be their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the day, to go to action and be a bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be happier that they would be happier to give a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their gain.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music be so <unk>
It's hard to pick something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions make this make it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about my three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> and bright, and also very <unk> I want to grow in a world to grow.
It's where strong creatures are going to be <unk>
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We all can make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sex violence against women like sports, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change radio radio when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their roommates as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men -- heterosexual guys can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, to participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range.
Those of us who are <unk> but they are going to engage in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be even as much as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision decision.
Now we're not <unk> Without these efforts, without having these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little courage of courage and hoping that our decisions are going to get to the top of the people in the power and film producers and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, the most brave people to create a durable and meaningful change.
We can also say with bravery our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because I was going, my voice was <unk> and feminism has helped me <unk>
There was a incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
It was my voice, and after all of it not <unk> to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would focus on a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked at me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I put the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had been <unk> by having visited <unk> or by being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune immune system is one of the most easily preventable disease in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this since over half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been immunized because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed controversial about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being an mortgage fraud by the British Medical Medical Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism growth in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she create their whole professional life without seeing one case.
Over decades, the prevalence of prevalence followed stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> fundraising fundraising is routinely referred to autism as an epidemic as if I could go from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, visual contact itself.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were those cases of autism so hard to find before the 1950s.
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the prospect of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and the way was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a childhood psychiatrist Leo <unk> Hospital Hospital Hospital at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
You could have fun for hours by shaking your hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing it.
The basis of the <unk> patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
So for example, we will give you that diagnosis to child <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his office by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by a cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully on a refrigerator that they didn't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, stating things like the kids were simply <unk> what they heard their parents are desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> scientific psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid <unk>
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like "Please without services of support, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National <unk> Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What they saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids could not speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were all lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realized these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the year next to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he would take it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music class, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as disability <unk> in life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, a name called their little teachers, and he was devoted to helping in development of education methods that were especially suitable for them.
The Asperger's has seen autism as a diverse continuum that kills an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in the pop culture as the social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, worked silently with the American Association Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a wide and <unk> model.
These changes did not have broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked among us to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, you introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I should no longer have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected that it was, so that people with autism and their families finally destroyed the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame for the increase in the <unk> and a simple, powerful history, as bad as <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart center is that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's greatest <unk>
In the last few years, people who have been connected to the Internet to refuse the idea that the puzzles are the puzzles for solving for new advances -- to <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand the <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with the Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers -- employers in ability, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk> boat.
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
