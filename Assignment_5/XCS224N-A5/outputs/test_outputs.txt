You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more reading in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can be able to look like a carbon, or with the room of colleague, and nobody has chosen a architecture.
I'm here today to talk about circles and electrons.
And they know that a plant generally is something that goes into some place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a floor.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Blood.
It's the kind of complicated circle.
My circle started in the years in the middle school in State, Hollywood where I was the face of the class.
When you put up to blood every week in the gallon down, until a teacher saved me the life.
She saved my life to allow me to go into the bank of the teachers.
I did it in sex.
For three years.
And I had to get me from the city.
I had a play, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco -- California -- I found a love -- and in the 1980s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone called a phone called the Telescope that said, "I need to see.
I am developed that of adults we never get to know.
You could come to Holly, and please bring that man who I know you've already found.
And I should tell you that I have cancer cancer, and I'd like you to take you with this please.
Well, the next day we were in Clean.
We went to see it, we were crazy, and we realized that she needed to be honorically.
And we found it a place, we interact it, and we take it and take us from his family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman I wanted to know as an adult came to me, it became a dinner box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, he had become a circle -- and that epidemic that I talked to you was made in itself.
The elephant is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
I need true and beauty and I'm very happy that today was a lot of this.
It also needs -- you need dignity and love and plant? And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interacting.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first talks.
I was surprised.
My heart later literally was married, trying to understand what was from me.
The students to me all around the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't think that it was a kind of snow about another year of nine year after year.
The students are born when they get rid of the galaxies or they break out the ice.
Every tune has their own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are not going to go back and go up to the end, while others can't make it more and show in a dramatic passion.
It is easy to think, when you see a temperature, which are separated and only as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As a team goes down, I am represented their accident atmosphere.
As a little bit of a little bit of a free water water is very rich in minutes that feed many forms of life.
I'm going to photograph these students as if it was about the restaurants of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way and not will be going to exist that way again.
It's not death when they drive up, it's not an end, but a connection of his way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the teams that photograph is very young -- it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are about a team that photographed in Kerry, Greenland.
It is a little bit often to get a red talk.
Here you have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I would like you to pay attention to the form of the team and his flow line.
You can see here, it starts running, the boat has moved into the other side and the man is there.
This is a temperature of Greenland, in average size.
And the water is about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so also, the team shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two pairs in 1998, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one by getting a baby.
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of consciousness, because if you stop thinking about consciousness in itself, they're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And in this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the hope is joined to the culture of the fly.
And in the other case, the Christmas Chris is going to the collection of the village.
They both press and start life.
We'll talk about them later.
In my own activity that is going to get two rules.
In one of my roles, I work with the story of the authority.
I am a story of information, and what I study in this case is the way people landed the anatomy -- to say, of human bodies and animals, how they've considered the body flowers, the idea of the body, what have thought about the body.
The other role that I want in my work is activity, as a description of patients or, as I say sometimes definition of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I have worked with people whose physical features challenge social rules.
I've been working with, for example, with silence generals, two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with food, people much higher than the middle.
And I've been working with many cases of people with automobile sex, individuals whose physical telephone doesn't fit in the male schools and commercial females.
In general lines, we can call it interesting.
And the amazing approach is a lot of ways.
I'm going to put them some examples in ways to have a sex that doesn't be closed in the male or a female community.
For example, there is the case of the individual individual with Christian base whose gene Serve of the chromosome and tells the protections, that we all have in the front life, which becomes testing.
And then, in the front life, tests produce testing.
But because this individual comes from testing records, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the sense of institution to the organizations.
So there are high levels of test but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body is developed by following a slightly female cost.
When you know, the baby has a kind of girl.
It's a girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often it's not to the public, when it is growing and developing the beautiful bears, but it doesn't have the mental period, when someone is realizing something is going on.
And then you can make it experiments realize that instead of having savings and theory, it actually has tests and a circle and a joke.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, like men, we have in the body something called surprise flowers.
They're on the bottom of the body.
So the surfaces produce animals, the hormone of machine.
Most women like me -- I consider a typical woman -- I don't know their critical structure, I think to be a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the artists.
We produce animals and respond to the artists.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the organizations that the woman who was born with tests that have the sense of inspiration to the organizations.
So sex is something complicated -- it's not that the amazing are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example, a few years ago, I got a call of a 19 years ago born and raised as they will go, I had novel, and sexual relationships with her, he took a life as a lot and just discovered that I had savings and terrible.
He had an extreme way of a disease known as a frozen supercomputer hypothesis.
He had 20 and in the roof the surface flowers were so active.
As a consequence, their genes were made market, his brain was exposed to the horizontal hormone computer.
He was born with a child, no one was supposed to be a sound of anything.
And it went to the age of 11 years when I started to have medical problems caused by the internal message, when doctors found that, in fact, it was women in the inside.
Well, another quick example of an amazing case.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what you know as objects, it is to say, they have an extra extra tissue in a terrible tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there's a lot of sex.
The reason that kids with these kinds of bodies -- -- -- they're signal, signals or interesting self-self-representat -- they have normal surgeries that are not to be able to get a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you get to several surgery is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular animation is a particular identity.
We have the idea that being women is to have female identity -- sure, being black wants to say to have Africa in historical terms.
A terrible idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with carticular.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture that we have to be in the individual.
Our nation is based on an concept of very romantic individual.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born as two people inside the same body.
The most crazy case is last year with the South South South South South South South Second Second, he put his sex in the International games.
A lot of personalities called to ask myself, "What are you going to do to determine if Canada Sense is man or women."
And I had to explain to the personalities that don't exist as well.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't bring a line with men and women or women or interesting men or interesting men and women and interesting men and interesting men, we are who we treat that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more advanced science, more we have to admit that these categories that we thought were strange artificial categories that are being recorded directly with stable identical categories, are much more discovering than we think.
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race -- something that turns out much more complicated than the temperature allows it.
As we see, we get in a way in a way in a service.
Let's look at it, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we going to get in the fact of building them in just a few neurons.
And as we program in science we get more and more in an amazing area in which we have to recognize that the simple features that we manage probably are too simple.
And we're looking at this in all the emissions of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the short streets and the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body is a human tourist and has different rights to the feet.
There are a very nice discussion today -- maybe not in public -- but I know inside the medicine -- you know, when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to look at this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a platform in front of the nose and if you move it still didn't work.
If I stopped moving it up.
But today we can, for example, extract organs of a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we need to face the dilemma to actually determine someone -- and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple features of the past.
And you may think that this collection of carbon could be able to get someone like me.
In politics I am progress, I mean people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
It will tell you that these characters are a lot more amazing than we thought about me.
Think from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a serious framework of the Foundations Forest.
I know they were rationally, I know they were sexualized, but they were big.
I mean, they were so valuable and horrible and so radical in what they did, that I find each other looking at that music by called 1875, and not for music, which is totally passionate.
That's why it happened in 1875 with the Fortunates Fortunates.
The Fundamenta Parts were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain to them why.
What they recorded was a anti-political concept and they replaced it with another which was radical and beautiful and beautiful for 200 years.
And as you all remember -- what you remember our Fashion parents was the idea of the mountain -- the mountain was based on a very simple concept of the authority.
The old world managements didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to the political power for the blood right of the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The Fundamenta Parts recorded that idea, and they replaced it by a new artificial concept and that concept was that all men are created as well.
They came up with the game field and decided that the anatomy that matters was the common in common and not anti-positive differences -- that was very radical thing.
And they were doing it because they were doing a part of a strange system where they were getting up two things.
And he was getting democracy and at the same time it was born the science.
And it's very clear -- if we look at the history of the Fundamenta Parts, that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a natural world.
They were designing from the survival expectations and where they collect the concept of sustainable power to be a serious idea of a birth right now.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if we look, for example, the Department of India, talk about nature and the God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in course they were bringing the idea of the artificial civilization.
And when you do that, they were feeling the basis of the future of civil rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years later, right?
And women.
Then I came the success of the Civil rights movement with people from the Wall Trade, which said, "I'm not a woman.
We found men in the ways of the Civil rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
Again, people of color that took the artificial civilization on the artificial difference and again, they transported it.
We see the same with the Monical Movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at consciousness we need to start asking why we keep certain divides.
But attention, I want to keep some artificial directions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to tell you that we should stay to the authority.
I don't want to say that five years of five years were allowed to have sex relationships or cause.
There are some artificial directions that for me have sense and I think we should keep on.
But the challenge is trying to figure out what they are, why do you keep them and if they have sense.
Well, let's go back to those two being connected to the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both connected to media in 1980 exactly the same day.
We imagine that one of them, Mary was born three months before time, one of June June 1990.
Henry, by the contrary, was born in terms of the control, I was born in the 1980s.
For the only fact of having been born three months before Mary is advertised all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to Heroico -- the right to the voice, the right to baby.
Henry has to wait for all that not because I have a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other roots in relationship to their rights.
Henry of being considered -- if I haven't told you whether it is NAS, in vision of being considered now is a particular man in which Mars doesn't have to worry about.
Mary of your part, it doesn't have the same rights to the marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry with a woman just in some states.
So they still think of artificial categories that in several aspects are problems and impossible.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science came up so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could describe?
I don't want to go to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is specifically.
Where are we?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of a professional attitude -- "Well, we have to bring the line on some part, so we're going to do it.
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a certain moment has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have a creature and that to marry a woman you have to have a creature and have to be creative.
Now, in practice they don't make critical elements to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the institution of the institution of intelligence.
If you look at one of the fundamental parents of modern democracy -- Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I go to Drug offer a solution.
He says that we should play people down not on the color of their skin, but in the content of his career, getting beyond the authority.
And I mean, "Yes, the idea seems very good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you play people on the content of your care?
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be based on this to take them back to people, because I have to admit that I know from some of them reverse that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the labs that I know can take more informed decisions and smart decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 that I know.
So how do you put the issue of the control of care?
It's very difficult.
And a part of me is wondering what happens if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with a magnetic research.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to keep up with this kind of thinking about relationship to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we will make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the order that a man who feels attracted by other men is supposed to be adapted, unless it's willing to support a sex change in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made a couple years ago that I had done a couple of years ago to separate them and how to get their family.
But when the phone asked him the movement of operation was a very red operation -- I realized that in that other country these kids would be very multiple and because I had to do it.
So what I said, "Well, it's considered political standard instead of the surgery search?
The United States offers enormous possibilities to people who are without adding it to change for the good of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot of the parents.
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we would have given more participation to the mothers.
And I want to say something a little radical for a female, and it is that I think you can have different ideas of different authorities from different authorities -- particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the interesting, I also have been interested in research the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've interested is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about traditional studies is that women, in average, not all of all, but in average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to get out of those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in the population, one of my ancestors that I knew I was interested in the phenomenon -- I was considered by food, like now, I made a strange plant.
Tell me what the female is female.
And I thought, "It's the most dumb question I've heard about.
The phenomenon has to do with the generation of gender stars, so there's nothing female in the female?
But the more I've thought about his question, more of me have been like there is something female in the phenomenon.
I mean, there might be something -- in average, something different between the female brain and the machine that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very happy to find the way to protect people around the state, it's possible to have increased more mothers to this concept -- maybe we would have increased the concept of protection with the support of a representative support of protection.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond the authority, thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect one, we think about what we do each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to remember how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go live and work, I have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new resistances.
Well, at this moment we're far from that goal.
There are thousands of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about the cities is that they fly much more than their cost of construction.
So we can easily get it into the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can sound up if you've never thought about new cities.
But you just replace them by approaches of approaches.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in approaches were already proposing and that the other half is still going to do it to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to do applications in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you will face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the molecules and the distribution of the building.
So it would be very difficult to do all those applications.
But they could go to a completely new place to build a completely new approach building and always and when the rules of that place are fascinated in time to put it up in time.
So I proposed that governments create new energy areas to get cities and gave them a name, and I gave them a strange city.
And later I learned that more or less at the same time, Jave and Activity were thinking about the challenge of the Homestate resource.
They knew that every year about 75 homes would get out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could be able to stay and do those same things in Honos.
In the summer of 200 Americans spent by a constant construction crisis.
In the next religious choices, Peter John was supported by a platform where I promise resources and at the same time.
He asked Accidenta to be his general feet.
Meanwhile, I was prepared to give you a talk at TED.
Through a process of perfect, trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of normals, like those rules that say that you can't go and monitor all the current research researchers.
We put a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules to progress, and they usually are the rules that are going to get to us.
In the top of 2010, a friend of Guardian sent him to According to Accord a telephone with TED.
I showed it to Japan.
They called me.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our country.
So in December we put up in Michael, in a content of a hotel room.
I tried to explain this point about what the cities are the cities, much more valuable than their whole cost of money.
And I used this image that shows the value of the ground in a place like New York City, Feynman, terrible that, in some cases, fly thousands of dollars per square meters.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a passion, According to said, "Paper, maybe we could see the video of the TED talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a low city is a place where you start with terrible terrible, a star that species the rules that will be applied there and an option for people to choose if you want to go or not live under those rules.
So the president of Honoson called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our own country.
I asked me to go to Telephone and talk about four and five of energy.
So I presented another talk about data, which includes an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Dender and the white line is the new ancestor that became to describe.
Just this account covered over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the homes that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that I measured at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100 meals.
All of the world applied completely.
The public faces were very serious and attentions.
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor Rome, thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TED talk.
I have here in my computer.
So I sat and showed the TED.
And this explains the essential thing, that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could go to be in Honoson, rather than hundreds of miles of distance to North America.
And also including new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of American government would need help of aspirating countries, they could benefit from the countries that would help them establish and make the rules of the state, so that they could all trust that the state effectively comes up.
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily be a thousand square miles.
And a little bit later, the 11 of the energy, they flew in Congress to understand their Consequence and add a constant device that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that was just going to go through this painful crisis, the vote in Congress in favor of this constant understanding was 125 to one.
All of the particles, all of the factors in society, they represented.
To include in the Constant, you have to take two times in Congress.
The 17 percent federal came over again in another vote, 14 to one.
And immediately after the vote, 21 to 24 percent free, a deployment of about 30 hours went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participate in the construction of cities.
One of them is South Korea in South America.
This is a picture of a new great center of the city that is building in South Korea, it's bigger than the Bone center.
All of what you see there was built in four years, after a four years getting the fish.
The other interesting country in the building of cities is Synthin.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third one.
And if you think about this in practice, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are paying a legal system that would allow the architects to come from, and at the time I would allow you to operate under an external dark system.
A country has already been committed to allow her Carton Surgery to be the last institution for this new Jewish system.
There are urban and building cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get something to focus.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of stories.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to install in the America, especially in a place with a free area of body and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they're solar mothers that have to win money to just eat or buy rapid.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to get up with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about the building of a new city in Honoson: Honesty?"
Or build a dozen of these, or a sense of these around the world?
What do you look like to think about inspired for families to choose between several cities that are competing to attract new resistances?
This is an idea that's worth disappearing.
And my friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm Jessee, and this is my value.
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public conference, and it's that, I live obsessed with the bases.
I love to find out, seeing, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog brought based, collaborated and different for each other.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of public markets and seconds of second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my fragile in the environment and my biology.
I get to know interesting people, because my money goes to a good cause. My aspect is unique -- and buy it becomes my personal search for test.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is my street?
Would I like color?
I'll cost less than 20 dollars.
If all the answers are positive -- then I feel I have gone.
So coming back to the issue of my value, I want to tell you what I moved for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you do with someone who has all that role?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought up.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothes and nothing else.
Internet room for exactly a week is all I put in my value.
I mean, I would imagine that it would be able to find all the other thing I would like to use after coming up with Salar Spaceres.
And because they don't know me like the woman who walked through TED in the bottom,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now for this week.
Don't sound interesting.
As I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that you know, or not, I've learned in this advantage of not using new rock.
Let's start with the dominant.
This is a brilliant talent.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can almost always see you for less than 50 dollars.
All the source, including the call, I cost 55, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
Lungs, color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be a bad human, when you're looking at a brilliant red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars is surprised.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time to get it.
I just know yourself.
If you surrounded out of the right people, you won't just understand you will be going to get you.
Microsoft, the child you take inside of it.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the devices, or I remember you to her little seven years.
I like to keep you and say, "Thank you.
Justines: The trust is the key thing.
If you think you see it well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, probably it's true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside -- you don't have a look at you that you can't go on.
So there's no excuse for no one of this audience.
We need to be able to do everything we want to do.
Thank you.
Virgins: A universal truth six words for you, the red laws go with everything.
And finally, I used to develop a personal state and only is a great way to say to the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people came up with me this week just so I was using it, and we had fantastic conversation.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, Brolling, I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to support these things, because at the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit -- collaborative and brilliant with me, if there's a little love of love in my heart and looking for.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic part, and the right side, which is the international part.
So if we used a scale to measure the app of every hemisphere, we could design a plan of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely crazy.
This would be somebody who is totally intelligent.
So where do you grow your brain in this scale.
Some of them will get out of one of these extreme -- but I think that for most of the intelligence of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great app in both stories at the same time.
It's not that they're very excused.
You can be logical and intelligent.
I consider one of those people, which as most of the other experimental quantum physicists we need pretty much logic to continue these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite an intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intelligence? Well, we like to play with things.
We put us to play with them, and then we see how they react -- and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A certain intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be just in a place at the time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion -- they developed it.
I remember looking at a child playing in a start barrier.
It was a little child, and he didn't do it very well, it always goes down.
But I bet that the place with that battery bar taught him a very long lesson -- and it's that big things don't allow the transportations, and they stay in a place.
This is a great concept model that you can have in the world, except that you are a physical physics.
It would be a terrible model for a physical physics, because they don't play with statistics of statistics, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, you find that they do all kinds of things that are really rare -- as you can go through walls or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics theory.
At that point he was found a few years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects that give us every day.
That wasn't very good at my intelligence, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a particles.
But it was not a good bit of my logical part.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics -- then it shouldn't be the principles of quantum mechanical mechanism?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics as well.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a quantum mechanical security.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That is the kind of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to take it a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a good good approach at the little traffic train.
So what we see is a little bit of metal metal, with a form of transportation and support on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip chip and I put all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this building with a form of national state that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum supermarket, but for it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make a analogy.
You know what it is to be in a level full of people.
I mean, when I am in a slide alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people are going to stop doing those things, because I don't want to bother them, or actually to stop.
The quantum mechanics says that innovative objects behave in the same way.
The journey companies are not just people, it's also the light that would be surrounded and the wind that happens to his side and the room of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to the quantum mechanics -- we would have to expand all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put the lights -- then we introduced a application and we put all the air, and then we face it to a temperature of less than a degree of a degree on the absolute brain.
Now, by being only in the land, the little piece of metal is free to act as I want.
So we measured their movement.
We discovered that it moves in very strange ways.
Instead of getting perfectly successful, I was looking at it, and the way he was looking at it was like a research in this way -- like a flag that is expanding and against it.
And when you give it a subject supply, we could make it worth and that doesn't see at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one is worth and doesn't see at the same time?
Let's think about them.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that trust that piece of metal are experimental and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in the institutional designers when those are advanced.
In the rest of the time are depressed.
It wants to say that every single thing is in two different places at the same time, which is the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.

I was worth to get it into a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, look at this, the difference in scale between a single take and that goal of metal is more or less the same thing that the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if a single thing can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you do it?
I mean, it's my logical part that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how would it be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was depressed in space.
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we carry it, and we got the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal followed there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intelligence, especially all of the objects in the elevate are actually just quantum objects that are just done in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is that everything is interacting.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound than that.
This is that those connections -- your connections to all the things that are running up, literally define who you are, and that's the deep root of quantum mechanics of the quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is America.
And 18 months ago I did another work in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related with museum and art to my boss that is here and allowed me to take it to it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of business and stories -- it surprises, with 17 very interesting museum in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the moment.
There are a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explained in this slide and this is the accident.
I grew up in India.
I got a great education -- I didn't get -- but I didn't have access to many of these museum and art work.
So when I started traveling and go to music, I started learning a lot.
And working in Google, I try to ask the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we form a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
But better than it shows the fear to tell you a couple of interesting things that we have taken up from their law.
So we just go to Google.
Look around all the museum that's there.
It's the galaxy galaxy, Momman, the Microsoft, the Roman Google.
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite, to Mexico, the art of New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We make clear and family, we're already inside of the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, Boy or Michael, that actually doesn't matter.
You move out there and they are fun.
Do you want to navigate the museum?
We open on the top of the top, and with a single customer, we go into it.
They're inside that you want to go at the end of the screen.
They're going to go forward.
Explorer.
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The Professor of Peter Britain in the Mexico.
I see the sign one.
If the museum shows us the image, we make a click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
This is all the data information.
For those of you who are really interested in art -- you can click out there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the global technology.
So this image, for example, it contains -- I think, about 10,000 million dollars.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 million pieces?
So I'm going to show you what it really gets up with 10,000 million pills.
It can do a very simple way.
You see different things that are happening.
I love this girl, your expression has no price.
But if you really want to define it.
So I started playing and I found something that happens there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems interesting.
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I invented a little bit, I talked to some people in the Mexico, and I actually discovered that this is a game called understanding, which is a game called a scale with a step with a step of Carrier Mars.
And when it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to move even more in deep and you'll see that you can actually get even to the grades.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to get out the image, so you'll see really what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to be going to jump over again.
Here another one of my favorite, "The Nigeria night."
The example that I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the pictures?
And if you want to see how Google Google actually created this mastery of medicine?
It increases it and I really do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this friend, and I'm really going to get to the grandmothers.
This is "The Nigeria night." I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another from my favorite function.
There are many things over here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "Comes."
All of you, absolutely all of you, doesn't matter if it's rich or poor, or if you have a man, that gives the same.
You can actually create their own museum to create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go in, I created this function that I call "The Poem Poet, we just just did a mom around the way.
It's about "The Nations National Galaxies Galaxies.
You can encourage things to send them to their friends and keep a conversation about what they feel when they are going to be able to control these shows of shows.
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they are not coming from music.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humility with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes their art work and it's represented in the line.
And the great question that you do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum?
And the answer is no.
It's to complete the experience.
And that's everything. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a pill, a flying pill.
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am an Italian origin -- all the kids in Italy, they grow up with this picture on the wall of their dominant, but the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the faces of France one in the last two decades.
There was no time ago, if you wanted to win a frame of France one, I took a budget and put it to a good pile and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering, it will be called the actual time system.
It's essentially a system that has two companies, a sense and a accident.
The interesting thing is that control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered of networks and electricity.
They're getting computers into the free air.
And as you know, they're starting to respond in different ways, and they can be detected and accepted.
It will make cities a big thing.
As a note I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the power of the planet but represent 50 percent of the global population.
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions in the CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
More of the cities, all these choices and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an extend of Palentin Antiberties for years of year in Momoro, during the summer.
It's called "The "The Tom Things, NASA.
Well, our objects, the environment, start talking about.
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms become sensors and automobiles.
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a certain sense is almost like the old dream of Minister New Medical Middle.
You know, when Michael New Schools wrote the Mother, he said that at the end took the car, and he brought it to the Moderate -- you can still see a little bit down, and he said down, "Partner is not saying, "Why don't you talk about?
Well, today, our environment starts to talk about.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples -- inspired in the idea of capture the environment and accept something.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago.
It was a summer with lucky of 2000.
It was the year in which Italy won the World College.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Turkey and France, and at the end of the Wing gave the head.
And anyway, at the end of the English gain.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Columbia in the middle and the river Iran.
It's the morning, before I play.
The time line is on the top.
On the early afternoon, there are people over here, and there are called moving up and moving up.
It starts the particle?
Google from France.
The person, people do a quick call and goes to the boat.
Second time. Even the record time.
First extra time.
Given, and at a moment, the head.
Gang Turkey, yeah.
That night was all to celebrate the center.
There you see the big skin.
The next day they all went to the center of the winning team and the first mission of time.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called City Marshall where, from the time, people are going to celebrate -- it's a big finger, you can see the fish at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the town of the city in a way that we couldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of depression, it's not about people, but of things we use and we consume.
Today, we know everything about the production of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the kids that trust a Machine, how they show up.
But we know very little about where things.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to cut the basis in their breath by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were running up, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of the way they would do.
Then we put it a little chip -- a street, to the base and then we started to show it.
These are the opening results.
Particular Sense.
After a week.
And with this information we realized that there are many investigations in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist.
They're going to be complicated things, and there's a lot of transportation transportation.
But the other thing we believe is that if we see all the days that the rate that we throw up is not still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we throw a day still there is still there.
That if we show that people -- then we can promote some of the computer change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague of MIT, Asia Bible, could tell us much more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in Barry ...
It all started with a question of the city of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, will go to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shoel, it was, imagine that they have a box and values, values of soldier, laws that are open and come up.
It's created as a water corner, with water pills.
If you take the pills to write in them, showing patterns images, images.
And when we close it, the courage will open up so we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the Belly male.
He liked a lot.
And he decides a company to design the building in the experiment.
We called it Daniel Didnicout.
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors or videos, but when you take it up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered of water.
And if there's a little bit of wind if you want to minimize the sacrifices, you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all of the architecture depends, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter when you go down the roof, someone who was there and he said, "Do the building.
No, it's not that they have demonstrated, but when you go down almost all the architecture disappear.
This is in work.
You see the integrated people in which it happens in.
And here I'm myself trying to try not to give you the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All of the kids in Barry came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that was open to leave us to go on, but a building that kept doing costs and water holes and you had to jump up to not get it.
(Are of people -- and for us that was very interesting because as an architect, engineers, designers we always think about the use that people will give us to our design.
But then the reality is always impressive.
And it's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pills, the water pills, and of projects about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those birds could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pilot that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter -- like the ones we saw before, which is moving with others in the single way.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal conflict in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the pieces.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen comes into different scales and size, in different kinds of revolution.
And then all that was able to be able to be a three piles in 3D to which you can get up, and go back, and see from very different animals.
This is the real controlled Flord, going down to form a Viet, like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have every piece with a condition that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with Robert Blood -- one of the best ball dancers of today, the Melaban star of New York and the Milk School -- to capture their movements in 3D and use them as a computer for Flash.
Here we can see Robert doctor.
On the left you see the pills, the capture in different solutions.
It's so much dynamic 3D in real time as a movement.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can remember all the way.
And once we have the pills we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible enterprise for Flash.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working with.
It's something for the Olympic Loves of London.
It's called the Nunce.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as much as a cloud of clouds like a crowd, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could do that they would all give you a little bit for a pile.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've diagnosed everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us -- we can go from the digital world, the anti-pocitical power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But morning can be to address the challenges of today, think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved to do this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pills in the same way that the real cloud is a course of particles.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are pills.
It's a physical structure in London.
You can move into the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will serve to share the main moments of the Olympic Jolemon Jolemon and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cubic cloud of the sky as something you can get up, like a new top of London.
You can enter there.
As if it was a new digital foreign in the night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory, for a more accurate and more fast.
Or maybe you might like to be in better way, being more strong to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe of themselves.
How about living more health health?
Or maybe they're about those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you like to do?
What would you like to do, if you could choose something?
Member of Audience: Creativity."
How many people choose creativity.
Take your hand. Let me see.
First of them probably got to the amount of creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about the levelance?
Oh, most of that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe being possible?
The evolution has been a website here in the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great gene of the 20th century, TED -- that I was in the Molecular Robert Turkey, wrote a strange time "No biology has a sense of sale to the light of evolution.
But if they effectively accept biological evolution -- this is just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well in an end, is, of course, the most interesting.
We stopped a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interaction there has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hospital.
Some of them have gone and back.
We have been here about 100,000 years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in their most the basic machine of our cells is more or less the same.
Do you realize that we can apply and control the machine of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human institution that is used to treat the digital?
This is not like human institution, but it's the same protein -- committed commercially, which comes out of the participation.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the most bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body.
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Anti Damas puts them out of the artistic, think about bacteria?
The intuition is a wonderful hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's clear, dark, there, it's very correct.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without effort of their part.
It really is like a quick thing for bacteria with the ocean interaction of some force for the room.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help to draw essential nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as species?
Or designed to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the environment.
In this room situation of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief company, the animal kingdom.
That was us.
And it was also the interest part of this talk so I hope they have been described.
When I was walking into college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by electricity and beauty of biology.
I looked at the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the universal organisms -- every cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is translated to the two daughters in the cell.
But when the mobile organisms are going to start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reputation that happens the genome -- the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you could say that the invisible of the body of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was college student thinking, well, sex, sex, death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but with every year that happened, every time I had more doubles.
I came to understand the feelings of George Britain, which was still acting in the windows right in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hit his hotel door.
He opens the door.
And in front of him you find a massive dance of role.
I look at it and says, "Came in looking for a sex subject."
"It's okay, he says, "Good, I choose the sound."
I realized, as a doctor, which was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution, not necessarily controlled, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to collect health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
The evolution is going to spend the genome to the next generation -- additional and self-incidentally generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of like representative collections designed to send the genetic charge to the next original level, and then let me fall into the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Jones Alex when he said, "I don't want to get the importance through my work.
I want to make it not died."
The evolution doesn't necessarily go to level.
It doesn't necessarily go to the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the more smart thing.
The evolution goes to the best advertising creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the ocean bacteria that can survive the heat of the farmers that would produce -- if there would be fish there, fish controlled to the cow, yet have been able to do that a correct environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look at it, to the next phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't evolve it.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reason would be that through medicine, in the first place, we have known a lot of genes that otherwise would have been destroyed and electricity from the population.
And second, as a species, we have contributed our environment for us to adapt to us as we adapt to him.
And by the way, we might marriage, we came on, and we increase so much that it's no longer possible to have the necessary application for the evolution.
A second possibility is that it becomes an evolution of the traditional guy, natural guy, implicated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be, that the farmers of evolution are reported and they are incredibly incredibly.
And in how much of the income, when we have different planets are going to exist the application and environmental changes that can produce evolution in natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- an attractive possibility and international possibility and artistic.
I call it religion, new evolution, which is not just natural but down and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we will do.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are taking decisions about their description.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more valuable than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to individual and family.
Think also that if you can be able to choose not just the sex of their description, but in their own body to make genetic advances to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove the dinosaurs or the Alternation or reduce the risk of cancer or electronic the specialism.
Don't you want to do those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome project started in 1990, and he was 12 years old.
I cost 2,000 million dollars.
The next year of having ended up in 2009, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion parts of the human genome to a close cost at the age of 20,000 and in a week.
It's not going to make a lot to do a lot to do the human genome for 1,000 and it will be more and more and more and more than all of everyone.
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human institution in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect them from them, but they're going to drive immune against other virus.
Crack or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against the collective influence in the cells of a street plant.
Can you imagine something good at the street?
That's reality today and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only other two little changes.
Can you change the cells of their bodies but if you could change the cells of their description?
And if you could change the mirror and the volumes, or change the flamer recently, and give your kids a better opportunity of a more healthy life, to remove the disability, to remove the health, reduce the risk of cancer.
Who does not want more healthy children.
And then, that same alternative technology, that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases will allow us to be also able to adopt specifically specifically applications, a better memory.
Why don't you have the engineering of a Ken Kenness on all if you could increase it with the next generation of the Matterness machine.
Why don't you have a faster control muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why don't we live more time?
This is going to be incredible.
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can apply the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the revolution.
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 years old, and we can buy it to 1,000 years, and maybe it happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have before.
Are we going to use these choices in a better society, more successful society, more considered?
Or are we going to choose socially different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others.
Are we going to build a society that is more boring, and more robotic and more very seriously?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and here the wisdom needs to take these decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what you might think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explanation when you're at 400 feet old.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing clip closed, clinical called?
Clinton, clinical cell, class, class. It sounds artist.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the 1D.
It was the only one I could talk to the flight struggles.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. We probably put some birds.
The pilot had already looked at the plane and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot goes up the plane with the Human river.
It's usually not the route.
I took the motor motors.
Imagine being in an airplane and no flowers.
And then he said three words.
The three more developing words that you've heard about.
He said, "I will present for the impact."
I didn't have to talk more with the flight structure.
I could see it in your eyes.
It was tree. Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a institution.
We have this list of things to do before I die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the things I wanted to represent, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never had.
As I thought about that later, I came up with a frag, which is, "Come out of bad cameras."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to apply anything in life.
And that infrastructure, that purpose has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while we looked at George Washington, which was not for a lot of -- I thought about John, I really feel a great wish.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, I also gave my fire.
And then the time I woke up in things that didn't matter with people who are important.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as a media in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a hair with my wife.
It feels bad.
I don't try to have reason, Electric will be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental relative is going to describe, "15,000 14, 13.
You see the water.
I'm saying, "Please go from?
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we went down, I had the sense of the woman, I would die not fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go. I love my life.
And that strong was made in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first degree, not a lot of artistic talent -- --  --  and graduate, crime, like a small one.
And for me, that was all reason to be the world.
At that point I understood when you connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a big father.
All over all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I got a miracle -- not to die that day.
And I got another gift -- which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in another way.
You know, you are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you in their plane -- and please don't be like this -- but imagine and how do they change?
What would you do, they still hope to do because they think they're going to live for it?
How do you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And the most important thing, are the best parents that you can.
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called TED.
TED was one of the most important graphics in the 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Paper, I feel an ant in the legs.
And that was the beginning of Elex.
Today, TED has a total paradigm.
It can only use the eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design of design and animation and so obviously, the graph is something interacting that we admire and respect in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to Tono TED, TED, and his cause.
So I went and I met with his brother and his father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?
And his brother said, "I just want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me.
And I said, "A second, is not that I see Stephen Halfina, not that all people with parallel can communicate through those species?
And he said, "No, unless you have some important and you have a very good safe you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people.
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?
Does anyone see the film "The Facebook and the marketing."
They communicate in that way -- they go through the fingers.
I said, "That's architecture. How can it be?
So I presented with the only desire to get a challenge and instead of that signed a challenge that didn't have the least idea of how he was going to cover up.
I was committed with his brother and with his father there at that point, and so this is a transport, Tony is going to talk about it, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to do their art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on their inner interest can't communicate it.
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called Green "Building Read Red -- who have a technology that allows them to protect a light in any surface and then with a laser point, they draw about that and record the negative space.
So they go over there making art institutions like this.
All of the things that they go, they say, are part of a cycle of life.
First of all, they start with sexual organs -- then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and, at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentation.
And so I started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side to another had made a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of the security companies and we got a machine for TED could communicate -- a machine like Stanford Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun thing -- I call him America because when you talk to the guy you get an email of him, and you say, "I don't believe it. This guy is fantastic.
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programs from all of the records of all the professors of the planet, to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the back and these hackers and programs and confidence and advanced and advanced the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we did something completely statistically, and that when we went back to they would have taken the flames of walls and their place would be graphically.
But for two weeks we program, we went to the middle of Venery, my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called Extra Depression, NASA, and you can see description.
They are a couple of streets of sound source that we bought in the middle of Ven Beach, something of collaboration and things from Homo Department and Radio Shake.
We take a PSP camera -- we open it, we put it on a light of LED and now there is a device that is free -- they build the free code, the software is low in free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There is no sure that I say "No."
There's no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with parallel today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the TED room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this biological and air during the great organization.
And after more than a year of planning -- two weeks of programming -- intense trials of all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of their life, and it's looking through the system of support of their life.
We ran the road so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of a wall of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the space.
The great thing was that we had to break into the parking space, so we feel like we were reading the graph as well.
At the end of this he gave us an electronic correct and this was what he told us, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like I would have been under the water and someone finally came to me and I would get out there so I could respond.
Isn't it wonderful.
In a certain way that's our war.
That's what keeps us in movement, development.
And we have a long way to collect with this.
It's a great device -- but it's the equivalent of a Machine screen.
Somebody with this artistic potential.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robot.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of fish.
Remember, it's graphics? None of us is doing money with this.
All of our own balls.
The prisoners were the guy, "Oh, this is fantastic.
And I struggled something about us and then, in December, the Times magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best invention of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what I ended up to close the circle -- is that in front of this year at the Gulf of the Minister in the center of the Angeles is going to be an exhibition called "The States in the States."
And "Are in the streets is going to have the best experts of urban art Alexander, Shanghai Fash, Cascalitan Fash, all of them are going to be there.
TED is going to be in the room which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea, if you see something that is not possible to make it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible to the stage, the computer, the member, the medical -- nothing was possible at a time.
You can do it possible, anything from this room.
I am not programming, I never did anything with economic recognition technology, I just recognized something and associated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel that you have to do. If it's not now, what? And if I'm not me, what?
Thank you very much.
I've spent the last few years to stay in very difficult situations and at the same time a very dangerous time.
I went to jail.
I worked on a carbon minister.
Film in areas of war, difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun to the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been going on in stranger specialists with the only goal of trying to experience social issues in ways that are activated, interesting, and hopefully to analyze them in a way that you see interacting and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew it would come here to do a TED about the world of the markets and the pattern wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you can have heard of it, or not, a couple weeks ago, a sand in Ethiopia.
I sent some messages in Facebook -- some of the terms in Twitter -- I offered the rights of the name of my TED of 2011.
Which was the next thing -- "Oh the "Next NASA present? My TED present that you have no idea what it is about and according to be able to explain it in the face, especially if I put it on rule to you or their company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good medical opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDs.
Thank you.
It's a public talent, by the way.
So even with that speed I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you with beer.
But in the new film in which I'm working on, we would end up the world of the Mark, of public.
And as I said before, I have measured in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be prepared, nothing could be accepted, for something so difficult or as dangerous as entering the room with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morance Supermarket: I want to make a film that comes from products of products and the market and the public, and that all the film is funded with population of products and market and public.
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever selling."
What happens in "The largest film ever sold is that everything on top on the end of the end, it has pictures of market, all the time -- from the audience that comes before the title -- the 1.2 market.
Now this market, "Communication Standaps, the Sense States.
These people are going to be able to get up to permanent film.
And so the film explains all this idea. Michael Kanson: Is it?
I'm a recently recently passenger?
It was "Particular.
But we're not just going to have the pathogen of the six in the title but we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we can take all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoes and it becomes the most cool shoes that you have used.
The most cool car that you have led in "The largest film ever sold -- the best theory you have been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been being been being been being been being been being been being been selectively.
Kardle Kandering: The idea is then to show the markets as part of life, you can make them figure out the film, "My matter, and I actually showed the film of the mission?
The goal of the complete film is the transformation.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all of the movie, in the beginning to end.
And I would love that CO2 helps me make it happen.
Robert Frank, you know, it's great because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the main respect for the audience.
Wow. However, I don't know how to get people to that.
KB: You have a perspective. I don't know if none of it is very negative, but you know how it is going to represent? MK: No idea. David Congrado: How much money does it do to do this?
MK: A million and a half -- DN: All right. John Kanyan: I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but that no doubt is going to be going to be able to convince a couple of big markets.
WK: You know, maybe for the moment that comes out the film and look as a lot of white ideas.
MK: What do you think is going to be the answer.
Steve Russian, most of the answers will be "No."
MK: But will be hard to sell it, by the film or to be me?
JS: Both things.
MK:  It means you're not very optimistic.
So do you help me, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MK: All right. MK: Okay.
MK: We have to think about what markets.
MK: Yeah. MM: That's the challenge -- when you look at the people you have to treat it.
MK: We have some places to go to go to go. MK: Okay.
MK: I thought that "The camera means the camera meant we have a conversation outside of microscope.
It takes the camera means we don't want to know anything from your film.
MK: And so it was, one for one, all of these representative companies were gone.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought the concept of public -- it was to introduce the product to both people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
especially in the world today this interaction of new media and old media and old media schools, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle of attention that is going to take the message to the mass?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a galaxy error and that mistake was this.
It was actually not, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been good.
But the problem was what this image.
You see, when you look for the image of transportation in Google --   -- this is one of the first images that they are.
I like your way, Serios Britain. No.
This was the problem -- transparency, free of simulation or energy, easily depressed or seeing -- easily understanding -- that constructions for violence or activity of information, especially in business practices -- being the last line maybe the largest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name it, the president name, even the Chris name it.
But suddenly when it is about doing it really changes something change.
But why? Well, the transition gives fear --  like that weird thing that still still goes up.
It's predictable.   Like this rare room room.
And it's also very crazy.
What other thing is a street?
I'm going to eat a content of Colombia Shine.
That's very crazy.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to have a story.
We want you to tell you a story, but you know our story.
You see, when I was a kid, and my father stuck me in some mind -- and that's him looking at it as I used to do it, he said, "Hi, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an animation wanted to help me -- and that just because I met John Bong and Richard Banglades in many years, I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take into the international and go to companies myself.
So what I started to look at suddenly -- what I started to realize is that when you start to convince the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MK: I have friends that make big films -- huge movies, giant and others who make small movies, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make biological Hollywood films -- giant global, say that the reason why their films have so much successful is to the markets that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we going to compete with these big, giant films of Hollywood."
And the film is called "The largest movie ever selling."
How are we going to look at Bank in the film.
Every time I am going to go out, every time I open my business, you'll see the destroyed Bang.
At any moment during an interview with someone I can say "Are you very cold for this interview?
Are you ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you take you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview?
And there is one of these fabulous trains.
So much French Fortunate as "Pen Prosperies are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man as a woman, sun -- ball, in bar, as it is.
That's the general view.
Now I can tell your questions and give you a profound view.
Karrel France, we are a little bit.
Similar to the kind of smaller movies that I said, we are more good as a right market.
So we don't have the budget that you have other markets.
So to do things like this, you know, to remind people to the people is the reason why this is interesting.
MK: What words would be used to describe Bank?
Bank is in white.
KG: That's a great question.
Woman: Technology supply.
MK: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put on the store.
Man: We talk about something and free street.
I think France.
It keeps you free.
How do you get free free the more time, with better fraction, three times more cold.
So things like those who represent the benefits.
MT: And that's a military company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the common Peters.
They have to talk about my market.
MK: How do you define your market?
Man: My market?
I don't know.
I like good rock.
Woman: Let me visit the 80 -- a little less than it is laughing of land.
MK: All right, what is the Green market?
Green, a single one, MIT. Man: I guess the kind of generation, the style that I have to be like a dark flow.
I like a lot of the dark colors -- many degrees and things like this.
By the general thing I take access as a sun, or I like critical and similar consumers.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a classic conversation, Mexico Bender.
Man: The brand that I am, I call it the case flow.
Woman: In the hole of him, in part of the hole, in part of Girl Blook, I don't know.
Man: I'm the kind of machines.
You see toys for machines in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my market.
In my little sector, that's my market.
Man: My brand is FED because I get the market.
Man five, Market Clauser.
Is that something?
Banglade: I'm a band market.
Tom -- I'm Tom.
MK: Well, we can't all be market Marth, but often I have a classification in the interaction of dark flow and flying it.
I realized that I needed an experiment.
I needed somebody who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the "The "Parking "Perspective."
And I found a company called Julia Japanese in Partistan.
They helped companies like News, Federa, Hallow to discover that market personality.
If you could do it for them, they could just do it for me.
Brazil: Trade the pictures, right?
MK: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
AK: So I love a little bit how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MK: These people move my way to see the world.
E: How much of that world.
MK: That world? I think your world is the world where you live -- like people who reduce you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are originally originally, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in the West.
CA: What is the next thing you want to talk about?
MK: The next day of my life."
AK: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MK: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like rich things. I like weird things.
AK: How much of the "movement."
What is the male? What is the male particular for you?
Why is it important to record? What is the red response?
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other drugs have you had had had had had had had had you?
You have to be afraid -- what kind of mountain is you?
MK: Hey, "Oh, thank you. No, thank you.
AK: Thank you for your patient. MK: Thank you to work. AB: Yeah.
MK: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy around this.
Leanter Japanese: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different side, but complex companies, in your brand personality, the March Moran School is a consumer market.
They get very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's human nature -- to avoid the things that are not sure -- they avoid the fear -- those elements -- and you actually give you a little bit and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other markets are that?
The first here is classic, Apple.
And you can see it as well here to Tarry, Kid, Minister Minden Minister.
Now there are legal markets and conscious markets, those things that have gone and come and come but a confident brand is something pretty powerful.
MK: A confident market. What is your market?
If someone asked you to describe your identity of market, your market personality, what would it be?
Are you an attack attack? Are you somebody who makes the blood flower?
Or are you more good a destroyed attribution?
A little more called self-expensive, researchers?
The approached attributes are like being a lucky to be freedom like the Prince, controlled, advanced or additional or additional like Eric Flood, fast or girl, professor, medical or music like Galaxie.
Or are you more absolutely a destroyed strategy?
Are you conscious -- something like 100.
Are you starting to be a strange, traditional protein, protection, protection, you identify with Opera.
Are you conflict, strange, family, fact, surface, surface, sound or knowledge, like the Dalai Lama or America."
In the course of this film we had more than 500 companies and advanced and destroyed, who said, "No, they didn't want to form part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control on the end product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the neurons, and we got to tell the story in this film of how they now use the magnetic feedback to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as much for commercial market as for cancer.
We went to San Paul where they have been providing the public air.
All over the city for the last five years, there are no cards, there are no cards, no values, nothing.
And we went to school designers where companies are doing way in schools with limitation problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or in which I've had more successful are those where I've been interested with things right now.
And that's what these markets did.
They took the internationals, they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with art.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to people who are going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have it? They had success?
Well, since the movie is going on in the Sense of South, let's take a look.
According to Brazilian the film are started in energy, and since then -- and this is not all -- we've had 400 million printers in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half weeks.
That's just in the line, no pressure, or TED.
The movie still doesn't discover.
It's still not online. It's not in straight.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Finally, this film has already begun to win in the back.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked to her customers will not be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you take people out of that is putting them into failure.
I think when you train their employees in the risk of risk is paying up to the whole company to come from resources.
I feel that what it has to happen to do is we have to encourage people to raise.
We have to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that can take them.
In the last minute, you know, I think we have to give the fear.
We have to put that thing in a called.
We open fear. We open the risk.
From a correct at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And in definition, we need to get to transportation.
More than never a little bit of honest is going to get a long way.
And he said this, with honest and transparency, all my talk to "Watch Treating -- has been presented by my good friends of MIT who was 200 bought in the name in Ethiopia.
EM: becoming great data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
MIT presented "Are "The Transparency:
Thank you very much.
June Comernian, then, Moran, in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those 1950.
MK: It's an exciting question.
In my pocket I have a camera at the name of the TED organization organization of TED, the Foundation Foundation, a chair for 12,000 to be applied to my TED attention for the next year.
The idea behind the State computer guy is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest activity to develop nuclear weapons is the engineering plant in National America.
The gray box you see are control systems in real time.
If we can buy these systems that control speed and values, we can cause a lot of problems with the center.
The gray boxes don't use South Southern Southern Southern Schools, they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus of Kings in a piece of public country used by an engineering to build this gray box, then we are ready on.
This is the plan behind State.
We started with an institutional institution.
The head goes into the gray box and gives the consciousness, and the nuclear program will be demonstrated.
It's easy, right?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started research about State six months ago, the purpose was completely unconscious.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex at the Windows of Kings, the institution used multiple dangerous values.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray box, these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infected our environment with State and saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange things.
State was shared as a lab of lab to which he didn't like our way, the wave -- but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't have sense for me.
And then I was going to experience with different seats of that, I realized, and I thought, this is a degree attack.
It's completely discovered."
The institution is looking at the gray box if you find a specific conference, and even if the program that's trying to influence is effectively working on that place.
If not, Stanford doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what the goal.
It could be, let's say for example, an power of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we would discover the goal soon.
And so we went up and we put the car code, and we discovered that I was built in two digital bombs, a little and a big one.
We also saw that they were serving very deeply by people who obviously had all the internal information.
You know all the dots for the ones that I'm going to stop.
You probably even know how much of the operation.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the State instrument is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the charge is very complicated.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a show of this attack code.
We're talking about 15 billion lines of code.
It looks like the old term language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we looked at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we looked at temperature and data structures and we tried to relate to the real world, with objective potential of the real world.
We need theory theories that we can try or develop.
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent sand, it must be a valuable white -- and it's safe in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been represented.
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It's basically reduced to the nuclear energy plants and the Management of National engineering.
So I said to my struggle, "I got a list of all the experts in centers and power plants between our clients."
I called them and put them into a effort to play their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could apply the little digital eye with the corruption control.
Roberty is that mobile part inside the center, that black object you see.
If you handle the speed of this robot, you can certainly get it up, and even make the focus of the exploration.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and describe in a obvious effort to go back to the mental engineers, so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the digital digital child looking very close to data and their structures.
So for example, the number 197 is going on in that code, you can't be obviously.
I started to research scientific literature about how these centers are built in National and found that they are structures in what's called a career, and every care contains 180 centers.
That had sense, there was a consciousness.
And it got better yet.
These centers in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code.
A almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good consciousness.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
For no management, it wasn't like this.
The results have been opened after several weeks of hard work.
We usually ended up in streets and we had to start again.
And yet, we found that both digital leaves were taken to one and same goal, but from different animals.
The small eye is taking a card, and making the robots and the reductions, and the big head is communicate with six cards and manipulating values.
In the way, we are very connected in that we've determined what's the destruction.
It's National, and it's just Nationa.
We should not worry about other goals to be closed by State.
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- they really provented.
There is the gray box, and you see the centers.
What this thing does is to interpret the values of the sense of sensors for example, of the pressure of pressure and self-estemman sensors and provide legal code, which still offers during the attack, with false data data.
And I believe or not, these false training data are prepared by State.
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the robot, the security camera is providing a professional video.
Is it great.
The idea here is obviously not just to go to the operations in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and advantage.
The idea is to make a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operating couldn't act fast.
For example, in an energy plant when the great value of value is about speed, you have to open values out of it in a minute.
Obviously, this can't do a human office.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're compared, then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explore.
And the operating is not the operating system to notice it.
That structures.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is great.
It doesn't have anything to see, specifically with consumers, with urban engineering.
It could work also, for example, in an energy plant or in a straight failure.
It's great.
And you don't have a hotel, which will determine this card with a U.S. leader, as we saw in the case of State.
You could also use conventional technology of subjects to describe it.
It will be the most possible.
And if you did that, with what you would end is with a mass of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with great number of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Japan, has been public in many sides that people assume that Moston is the main amount behind this.
What is your opinion?
Japan Lenya, OK, really want to hear this?
Yeah. Okay.
My opinion is that Moston is involved but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is the scientific supercomputer.
There is one single one, and it's the United States, unfortunately, funding.
Because, in another way, our problems would be even better.
CA: Thank you for attractive. Thank you, Japan.
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take up and give underground skills -- or another one that makes you use out of waves of waves go back and go back to walk.
In Brazil Biologists."
They're not a different thing about something that is put in the morning, it gives you a great force, which is going to increase their speed, and help him, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real interaction of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can interact and connect it with the universe and with other external ones.
This is not an wrong idea.
To show you now in what we're working on we started to talk about the American soldier who, in average, has to take up on his wife a 45 pounds and it's going to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important implications -- lessons in the space, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with a horizontal days.
We decided to focus this challenge and create an exploration that could help us handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to introduce the HIV -- or Port Artisuden Americans.
Solla, with the HIV example, I can pay 90 pounds per virtual land for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put up in classics and exercise movements with great adults.
It belongs what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
Hower General, we're ready with our industrial society, to produce this speech, this new exponential, this year.
Or, it's a reality.
So let's go back now to the users of streets -- about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 16 million people at all, in the world cards, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really constructive circle.
We talk about something that happens with frankly, people who are very young, with days in the vertical column that when you start their life -- at the age of 20, 30 or 40 years -- they run against a wall and the wheelchair chair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that comes out of a professional professor.
His only choice, a lot of times -- by a brain lesson or some other complexity -- it's the class of the world.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their successful approach, as I should recognize it.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about movement.
Let me introduce you to introduce Eleven Bobbir who is using America Bobbin who was 11 years ago had a lesson in the vertical color, and as a result could not walk back for 14 years, until now.
Let Bobby: Thank you.
EB: Let's take up with our Eleverch, which I mentioned with.
It has a few sensors ...
They completely not investigated in the mountains that send signals to the computer, here in the space.
There are also a few batteries that give you energy to engines in the streets, and in the roles, and they do it with this subject and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years in the top of my life when by a strange jump on the air, by looking at it because I was paradilian.
In a second, I lost all feeling and everything movement of the planet down.
Shortly later, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, "Look, you will never walk back.
That happened 11 years ago.
So I stole to the last piece of hope of my being.
And the technology technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to get rid of the bottom in the way, scale rocks and even to move in a hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk up, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platform to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to the future generations -- not just soldiers, but to America, and all of the users of waves -- to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battle -- they practice sex to say bone, and play is the order of the day, where diversity is serious.
And no, it's not the fast of the American American or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their feet.
This is the world of the Sanda banks of Congo.
Bones are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living patterns.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their addition.
But unfortunately, we've done too much high in this aspect in our narrative of human evolution.
But banks show us the other side of the ocean.
While chimpanzees are dominated by big kinds of the grades, artists, the baby society is in the heart of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very clear society where moral violence still has not looked at.
But unfortunately, babies are the least understanding of the big sites.
They live in the deep collection of the collection of the collection set, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradigm, a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty -- but also the heart of the textbook -- stage of a violent conflict that has spread for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the first World War.
It's not to extract that this destruction also puts the survival of the bank.
The head of heart meat and depression do that you can't be able to get a student with the banks that go in the world, and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and expensive you can hear the risk of the trees.
Who are these ready?
We know them as the apes "Do love -- not the war, because they have free sex and professional and biological sense to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of banking is more than the Kang Store.
Books like humans, as humans love to play along their life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish victims and feed the tolerance.
We learn to trust and learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resistance and it has to do with the generation of diversity, diversity of interactions -- diversity of increasingly, diversity diversity of connection.
And when you look at the game, you see the evolutionary roots of the risk, the dance and the human rich.
The game is the picture that comes together.
I don't know how you play you but I want to show you a couple of unique videos in the middle of the saving.
First of all, it's a blood stage game, and I don't talk about foot.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a perspective.
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the front, it has the pieces of the pilots."
I just believe that in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much in banks as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play as the tests, and also how the game requires trust and feeds the confidence and the same time is the most fun.
But play is political.
The game is political, it can take a lot of ways -- some of which are more transportation, imagination, curious -- maybe the place where the amazing is.
And I want you to see -- this is Fuffin, a young man, which is playing with water water.
I think, like it, sometimes we play alone and explore the limits of our inner and outside world.
And it's that legal curiosity that drives us to explore it, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real sex of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that banking them from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a world every more difficult and greater conversation.
The secret is that game is the key to these skills.
In other words, play is our approach computer.
To adapt with success to a world that changes we have to play.
But will we take to the same of our game ability?
The game is not flower.
The game is essential.
For banks and humans by the same, life is not just critical and depressing.
When it looks like the less appropriate play, you can be the moments that the most urgent thing.
For that, principles, we accept this gift of evolution and play together while we discovered creativity and the friend and the surprise.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible to develop of an organization with no light finger called Robert Honor.
When I'm not taking the poverty -- I bought increases as a captain of capital in a body of flying bombs.
And in our city, where the volunteers are completely complicated to a highly clear person, you have to get at the site of the very soon institution to go into action.
I remember my first institution.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a career against the other volunteers to get to charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the capital -- I was fascinated in a conversation with the purpose that no doubt would go through one of the worst days of their life.
We were at night, she was standing out on the rain on the rain down, under a paradigm, and the piece of picture, as his house was in calls.
The other volunteers that I just got before I was called Leanter Luther --  I got first to the captain and this was asked to go into the dog of the house.
The dog, I was so characteristic."
So there was a band or me of money who, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people who walked into a building in calls to save a life just because I was won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a advantage.
He said, "Good, I need to get into the house.
I need it to go down, and I bring it to this woman a couple of shoes?
The subject is.
It was not exactly what I expected but I went up -- I went up the scales, at the end of the screen, I went to the real bombs that to that height or less had finished the fire and walked into the top of a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back through the scale where I met my Nigerian and the price in the main door.
We went out of the house the tears for the house of home where it was to hope, his weight received a lot more attention than me.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter of the rate of home detailed by the empty effort to save his house.
The member that she looked at about the other thing was that someone had reached it even a couple of shoes.
And so much in my vaccine in Robert Holly like in my vaccine as a volunteer of general bomb is a sense of gender acts and marketing in a monumental scale, but also of the acts of thank and corruption at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned.
It all has their important.
So when I look at this room to people who have done -- or you're going to get to do, non-term levels of success I'd like to remind you this, they don't expect.
They don't expect to win the first million to make the difference in the life of somebody else.
If you have something to give you now.
They see food in a food, they clean a park of the neighborhood.
They're mentals.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody but every day we're going to be able to influence someone in it.
So they go into the game, they save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark Mars, reach back.
Mark Beauths." Thank you.
This can seem strange -- but I'm a great administration of the concrete block of it.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1875 with a very simple idea, method methods of a finger as they fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, as buildings or plants, a law at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pills of our time.
Almost a context of years later, in 1999, to LED was happening this.
It was called a mathematical infrastructure.
And in a few years, the LED labor came to all the home.
It's estimated that you've made over 400 billion or 75 degrees per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineering to build beautiful pieces, buildings or home.
LG: It made it accident.
LG: I just adopted the conflict block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the White lab, the next revolution was about to address -- the new building block of it.
The transition was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic streets on a few other to a world where everything was interesting.
At the same that the concrete block is allowed to create a lot more and more complex, a law at the time.
But there's a main difference, the transition was just for jobs.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are researched to the experiments, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was in the Middle Lade, I started to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Linarians.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Little Little electrons are electronic models every one with a specific function.
They are prepared to be light, sound, motor and senses.
And the best thing about everything is that they get up by ministers.
So you can't put it wrong.
The laws have a color code.
The green is the sale, the blue is the correct, the room is the control and the orange color is the flower.
So you just have to take a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make more circuits better.
A blue with a green piece of light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a regulation.
If we change the button for a plastic cord -- which is here, and now we have an interesting light.
We add this shark to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, Linkans are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and soldier, Linkans allows us to program using very simple international generations.
To make a little bit faster or more slow -- you just get this button that makes the bridge faster or more slow.
The idea behind Linkans is that it is a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world are religious to little ready to use.
Light, sound, solar panels -- everything must be accident.
We've given Little Little kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electricity of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a night of night, or why the door door is keeping open up, or how an iPhone respond to the car.
We've also taken Little Little Liberians to design schools.
So, for example, designers without experience some of them in electricity start playing Little Little Little little material.
So here you can see, with paper bottles and failure, we have George creating.
So some metal sound --  -- a few weeks ago, we took Little Little Deterse designers to the design of Red Islamic, who don't have an experience in engineering, just in cars, wood and paper and said, do something.
So here's an example of a project that you've done -- a bunch of control controlled by movement.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a language made of plant that has fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, Linkans became another material, the electricity became another material.
And we want this material to be about all of all.
So Linkans has open code.
You can look at the website, to download all of the design architects and make them.
We want to add a world of creations, investment and computers because this world in which we live, this interactive world, is us.
So let me go ahead and invent.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discovery.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for involved with the environment.
The distribution computer.
This is a little video of what we do.
Mimor. Show a moment.
You can take a little bit of career.
We can get better to leave the video on a side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
The solar technology is.
Oh, I am afraid of time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an invitation to remember the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be supposed to be supposed to work in government.
The invisible was called "Country for American for America, and they would be like a few Percent Percent Books.
We select some members every year, and we put them to work with microscopes.
Instead of taking them to the Third world we get them into the saving world world.
They made great applications -- they worked with the musical jobs.
His task is to show the possibilities of the current technology.
You know about it.
It's a diagnose of the city of Boston.
This is how if you look for a quote -- but what really looks for is that someone called it when it goes up by the snow because it knows that it's not very good by adding income when it is covered by a foot of nine.
How did he ask help in this way so single?
Last year in Boston had a team of Mechanica for American for America.
They were there in freedom and at that time I was born a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never called these diagnostics.
But one of the members called Eric Michael noticed something more than the citizens called the coast in front of them.
So he did as any good program, I developed an app.
It's a light application where you can apply a diagnostic.
You accept to clean it when you go.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case I put it.
If you don't do it, somebody can break it.
Or you know, it has a legal computer.
It's a model app of it.
Maybe it's the most small thing in the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government does.
And it's extracted in virtual form.
A result of the Chinese City systems when I saw this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow but for citizens to support the subjects of tuna.
It's very important to work these tunations of tuna, but people are surrounded by the bacteria.
So I ask citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens represent the street determinations.
And Chicago was just going to get people to make people record to clean up when you go.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been defined without Africa, in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't happen.
The software of software takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that requires three people for two months and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us to have done for normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the public power of California that to the moment has cost 200 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and demonstrated in virtual form is a kind of advanced straight to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more as the Internet itself.
I mean, without restaurants, in open and generation.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new generation -- not like a problem of an advanced institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools so we work together with efficiency.
And it's not only Counter for America, but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute with civil applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given by conditions with government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get up, they fix it.
And these people know something we have lost of view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the Dimitri Red Authoritan, and all those other things that are getting closed, the government is, in essence, in the words of Tim Rillage."
Now, a lot of people have opened the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to remember, because things are changing.
The politics doesn't change the government.
And because the government in the last week of us -- remember that of us, the poem, the way to think about that affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government is to choose people to pick up careers.
Well, after two years I have come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about gravity.
This is the center of mobile attention and information.
It's the place that you get the calls if you make 32 in America.
Scott took this call.
Internet "Barrier in the official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put a strong music and see if you go?
And it works. So for School.
But that wasn't the end of the lands.
Bost has no cancer center.
It has an app and web and mobile and mobile and cell method, called "China Connecticut.
We don't program that app.
It was the work of very smart people in the office of New University of Boston.
One day, this happened really to get this question, "Barrie in my coast course. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to do it?
The Dimitan Chinese dynamics is different.
Scott was talking about people.
In Vennieves Connectical everything is public -- so you can all see this.
In this case, I saw it a neighbors.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the base of the base behind the house.
Karreland." Yeah.
I went back to the car. I went home.
Good night, they do that down."
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the conflict of the digital and the physics.
And it is also a great example of the government of government to the distributed flying colleague.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I talk about a platform so that people are addressed and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key paper.
I met two people.
And I could have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and stronger than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, let's get the communities.
If we call animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but I think one is the one in the other.
That our government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then hope that government reflects our values and satellites our needs but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immune ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 inches here.
It's what we call structure.
And we say that word with a lot of responsibility.
But it is that responsibility that keeps us that we feel that we feel like something that operate in our control, that other thing, and in course we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sense.
If we want this institution to be going to have to make the brain sense.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with government machine.
That makes the Western movement.
Have you seen them.
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed report of 32 pages in response to the September of Valley Company, on the financial reform project.
That is not political activity, it's corrupting activity.
And for the ones that we've sent up to the government, is time that we ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we're going to get to where we have to go without solve the institution that can act in behalf of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of
We can't present of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to replicate the function of government so that it can expand to force civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act monologically, you just have to increase the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 21 years so I me, recording -- I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown the word and giving that almost for sense.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk about, they're all going to talk about.
You can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the problem of the government doesn't care a lot to do their voices.
They're using the hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a diagnosis, looking at the backs, vaccine a coast of base that has a sand inside.
Of course, we were always able to have clean those dinosaurs and many people do it.
But these applications are like digital resources that we're not only consumers, we're not just government consumers that we pay income and get services.
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't fix the city.
So I want to ask all the present, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a voice multiple, or also will we be a man multiple?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I have spent most of the time in crimes, prisoners and the death of death.
I've spent most of my life in market communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of hope.
And I will be here at TED seeing and hearing these students that have given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things you say here are impact around the world.
In fact, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think the identity is really important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach the feeling -- you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, but if it's carticular, it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an American family in American family, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in family.
She started a lot of the doctors in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been scaled.
His parents were born in the scale in Virginia, about 1955.
She was born on the 1880s, and his experience with slavery and the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also love.
When I was small, and I looked at it, she came up and I was a good addition.
I was so lucky that I could barely breathe, and then I got up.
One or two hours later, I went back to look at it, and he said, "Bringing, you still feel my artist."
And if I told him that no, I was stuck back and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of the 10.
In fact, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My first were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up a morning, I went to the room and there were all my feet.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me.
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her and he goes, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she went down, I took the room, I took my hand and said, "You see Brazil.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, "Bringing, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody.
I said, "Okay, Mammada."
She said, "I'm going to thank you not to do it. I said, "Oh."
Then I sat up, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been looking at you.
And I said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to give me three things, Brazil."
I said, "Source, Mammada."
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother.
Audience: That's my daughter, and you have to promise it to always care.
As I was showing my mother, I said, "Yes, Martin, so I'll do it."
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is the difficult.
I thought I thought and I said, "Yes, Marria. So I'll do it."
And then finally he said, "I think I want you to be prepared to me is that you never drink health."
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Martin, so I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in the rural south -- I have a brother one year and a sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15 -- a day my brother came home with a six centers of sex, I don't know where the sand was based, to get me to my brother and me and we went to me and we went to the forest.
We just got to do the laws of always as well.
He took a certain service, I offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's good. You go, but I'm not going to take cereation."
My brother said, "Come -- I do it. And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister too. Take a cerement."
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can follow.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What do you happen? Take a cerement?
I took the look at the force with force and he said, "Oh, not being you're still thinking about conversation with Mammada."
I said, "But what are you talking about?
He said, "Man tells all the grandchildren that are specialized?
I was actually discovered.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be demonstrated as well.
But I have 25 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a piece of analysis.
I don't say this is a viruses, I tell you for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they don't really see it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been ready during the profession.
My kids died from related diseases with the alternative.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be compared.
Now, trying to talk about our personal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1984, there were 300 feet.
There are two million.
In the United States, we have the biggest collective of the world.
We have seven million people in everyday freedom.
And this massive electronics, in my opinion, has changed fundamental our world.
In poor communities or black communities -- you find so much department, so much despair to these facts.
One of every three black black between the 18 and the 30 years is in the prison or in everyday freedom.
In the urban communities of all the country, Los Angeles, Balia, Balia, Balifican -- 50 to 60 percent of all young young people are in prison or controlled freedom.
Our system is not just destroyed in front of the race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a Jewish system that is a lot better if you're rich and supporting that if you're poor and innovative.
It's not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to drive the results.
And it looks like we feel very transportation.
The policy of fear and force make us believe that these are not problems.
We're described.
It looks interesting.
We're looking at our work some completely curious development.
In my state, in Washington, as well as in other states -- they provide you from rights for always if you have a penguin condition.
Now in Albert, 35 percent of the black male population has lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it at the next 10 years, the loss of loss loss of rights will be as removed as it was before they were able to get the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where you feel like 12 years to die in prison.
We have in this country crime for kids, no chance to go on.
Now we are in a process of some literatures.
The only country in the world.
I represent people in the death of death.
This issue of death is interesting.
In a certain sense have been taught to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the commercial crimes?
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way to look at it, it's not about decide if people deserve to die by the commercial creatures, but if we deserve to kill us.
This is interesting.
The death is defined by error.
In every nine people except, it's identified one that is income that is excited and freedom of the death of death.
A strong rate of error -- an increase of every nine.
This is interesting.
And in addition to not allow you to pay planes if every nine that they would stop, you would have to be starting.
But somehow we put out of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our career.
It's not our subject.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we deserve killing matter.
It's interesting that in my classes with American history, I talk to you about scales.
I talk to you about terrorism -- the time that started at the end of the resource and he went up to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot of this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by the theory.
In many communities people had fear of being smaller.
I worried to be bombs.
The threat of the theory was what their lives.
Now there are older people who are going to get me and tell me, "Yeah. Sharp, you say to the people who stop saying that in our history we were able to say that in our history we were able to be the first time with terrorism after 1980.
They ask me to say, "No, say we grew up with that."
And the age of terrorism continued to be obviously with security and decades of rational surgery and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we have done in fact, we've done.
All the time we put with each other.
We constantly create tension and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about reasons -- I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and recording.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome rational security without the truth and the recording.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this company, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving conference about death person.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers went after my presentation and said, "You know it's good to listen to what you say.
Audience: We don't have death in Alexander.
We may never be able to have it here.
The room went up in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we can even get us into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we are interacting and demonstrated, we would put people to explore people.
Think about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Alexander, except people, especially if they were in their most flash?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be international.
And yet, there is this discovery.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't worry about these difficult issues -- the positive and wonderful things are, though, impossible.
We love innovation.
We have the technology. We took creativity.
We love the entrepreneur.
But finally, those reality are interviewed by suffering surface, addition, direction, marketing.
In my opinion, you need to interact both things.
We last talk about the need to have more hope, more compassionate, more education with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the shows, which you will never get to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational -- so compared to the intelligent.
With innovation, with creativity. Development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from food ideas also by the heart conversations.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what it leads to us to do not just in the brilliant and increasingly, but also in the dark and the difficult.
Valley Harvard, the big child leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering the option, we had all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, organization for the spirit -- a volunteer for being in settless and being testing."
Well, that organization for the spirit is particularly in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be compared.
There is no definition related to technology and design, which allows us to be really human if we don't pay attention to poverty.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's find them.
I had the great privilege -- being a very young advance, to meet Rome Parks.
These women are sitting just to talk about.
Occurring, the San Card was called me to say, "Bringing, comes from the Park Sanda. We're going to go back to talk to you.
Do you want to come and hear it?
I said, "I know. I want.
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?
I said, listen to you.
So I went and just heard them.
It was very visional, very extraordinary.
And in a time I was there, listening to these days, and after a couple of hours -- Mr. Parts came up to me and said, "Oh, Brazil, let me give you that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do.
And I started giving me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the infrastructure.
We try to help the ones that have been built up.
We try to control the predictions and the distribution in the adventure of permanent justice.
We try to end up with the feelings of life, without everyday freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce population in jail.
We try to end with the massive colleagues.
I gave it all my best speech, and when I ended up and he looked at me and said, "I love Michael microscope."
And he said, "You will end up advanced, very stranger."
At that moment, Mr. Card was including, I put the finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very but very value."
I think actually the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We need to find the way that you get those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst thing we have.
I think that's true for all the world on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a message, it's not because it's a mental.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to it, it's not that it's a land.
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a street.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be represented by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country, and yet, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic -- very beautiful -- very extremely extraordinary, it's not going to play for our technology, for our designers, not for our intellectual or rational capacity.
At the end of the control of a society, not by the way as they treat the rich and powerful and private and private as they treat the poor, the conditions, the presents.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I feel supporting -- I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
I mean, like everything.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasons in an important way.
I've been responding to these kids who have been senting with a lot of death.
I go to jail and I see my 12-year-old customers and 14 years old, who have been taken to play as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge become someone in what isn't it?
The judge was had as an adult -- but I see a child.
A very late night I was asking to think about, by God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, must have magic power.
Yes, Brazil, the judge has magical power.
You should ask some of that.
As it was very late -- I couldn't think right, but I started working on a movement.
I had a 14 years old, a little poor, book.
I started working on the movement, with a metabolism that said, "Mother for my black black of 14 years is treated as a private block of 75 years, except of a computer?
In the mountain I had been developed in the action, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an advanced line about how this country is no title, but all a lack of title.
At the next morning I woke up thinking about that movement would be a dream or really write?
For my hour, not only had recently, but he had sent it to the correct.
It was about two months, I had ever forgotten it.
And finally I decided -- "Oh God, I have to go to the short for this stupid case.
I went up to the car and I felt really a strange, and I felt really supporting.
I was in the car to play.
I thought this would be very difficult and perfect.
I finally got out of the car. I walked on the play.
I was coming up with the scales when I found a bigger black man, it was the consumer condition.
When I saw me, I came up and said, "Who is you?
I said, "I'm a book." He said, "It's you a book, "I said yes.
So I was passionate and addressed me.
And I used in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was visible.
That became deeply connected with my bottom, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Yeah." Sharp, you wrote this massive mountain?
I said, "Yes, Mr. I was me." And we started to discover.
People started coming up. They were all involved.
And I was the one that I had written those crazy.
They came up with the police fisheries and the audiences of the audiences.
Suddenly, without knowing how the room was full of people -- all of the forces because we talked about reasons, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about infinition.
With the room of the eye I went to see the conservation that was going and come from.
I was looking at the window and he was able to hear all that graph.
I kept walking up and over there.
Finally, this old black black -- I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost in the table of the bands.
About 10 minutes later, the judge decided a need.
During the destroy of the high state was shown because the conservation had entered the room.
The attention was stuck on the old black.
And he said, "Mim, what do you do in the audience room.
And the old black came out of fish, I looked at the strategy, I looked at me and said, "I went to this young audience room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal with figure."
I have come to TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral architecture of the universe is very big, but it gets out to justice.
That we can't be really human evolved if we don't worry about human rights and digital.
That our survival.
That our technology, design and creativity and creativity must be able to get rid of factories, compassion and justice.
And above all of all, to those of the presidents that share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the goal with fighting.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just hear and see a evidence of the audience, of this community, to help your propositions, to do something.
Something that's not a challenge. What can we do?
SB: There are several opportunities of closest opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a reproduction in which it will be going to be a effort to raise the funds that are going to be spending today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the death of death, in the next five years of dollars.
And despite this, 40 percent of the students are not continued in artists.
Five percent of the violences don't get to anything.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This representation is going to propose that you want to get these funds to make the law, the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge desert in the cities in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is saying that it has to do with the biggest rate of increase.
What would you tell you what you think is that?
BG: Actually, the rate of crime with violence has been relatively strange.
The great growth in mass interaction in this country is not by crimes.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the heart population.
And we let us convince the character of the car.
We have three legal causes to bring people to performance person, to steal a bicycle -- for small crimes against the property instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy on the punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the organization that has to change.
CA: Brong, you've been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much.

Peter Disconductors, these are just some of the clients that I got in the last six months -- they could actually be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means prefer to provide negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second day of every day our senses get much more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first part of all of those data is an ancient drug of the temporary line called a market the temperature.
The market is our early stranger description, the danger detection.
Organization and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that I could make a day.
So from a tens of stories we will prefer to look at negatives.
That old one of the press, "If there is blood, selling, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news for seven days in the week, 24 hours a day, not to extract that we are pictures.
It doesn't surprise that people think the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe in change, what really happens is that we got demonstrations.
Maybe the huge progress made in the last century by a series of forces is captured in such a way that we have the potential to create a world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the extinction of species and the water of water and energy.
As human beings are very good to avoid the problems, and at the long time, we just ended up with them.
We analyze the last century in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average average has been more than doubling -- the average income per capita of influence has been translated around the world.
The child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, the electricity of the electricity, and the communication has gone from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pintan showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles Kenya that the world additional spent from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 150 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
Many people forget it.
And we continue to put experiences every single time.
In fact, we reduce the meaning of poverty.
Think today in the United States, so much of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, banks, teachers, telescopes, medical air and cars.
The magic magic balls of the past century, the printers of the planet, would have ever been been with such flag.
To support a lot of this is technology, and finally, their exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Radio showed that any tool that comes up in technology of the information of the information on this curve, the Law of Moran, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So that's why the mobile cell is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the 1960s.
Now look at this curve.
It's the Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and the peace in the way, in record and in analysis.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's recorded on a law on the left, it goes up to up.
The growth of technology growth is more and faster.
And in this curve, to the homes of Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinary technologies that we have today.
The computer in the cloud -- that my friends of Australian call the infinite computer, sensors and networks -- the robotic printing and designers of the role, the set of distribution and distribution to democratic production and distributed productive production around the planet, the synthetic biology, the diagnosis and the food, the digital medicine and the directions and the America.
I mean, how many did you see the violence in Jessera of Amazon, in RIMC?
It was fish.
I was looking at the newspapers the best test that I would have.
And I loved this: "The "The "The Harvard comes to human opposites?
Jerusale is not a easy game.
I play with the mathematics of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Burran and I, we launched a new university called Symbolic University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to take a company, or a product or service -- that can actually affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
30 years ago that would have been supporting up.
Today, we can be able to be a decision of companies that have done it.
When I think about creating an ability, it doesn't mean to create cultural life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is scale and get it up.
You see, scanner is controlled and technology is a force that release resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Nalier II in the 1980s.
He's the kind of left.
He invited the king of Sime.
The Japanese troops started with plastic colors, and the same January, with gold cords.
But the king of Sime, I started with human cords.
You see, the authority was the most valuable metal of the planet, it is worth more than the gold and the plate.
So that's why the Monterey point of Monterey to Washington is ambular.
You see, even though the authority is 67 percent of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a mortality metal.
It's launched by oxygen and systems.
But then he got the electrons and made the student something so cheap that we use it as if it was depressed.
We project this analogy towards the future.
We think of energy electronics.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet based for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 thirds of energy every 18 minutes.
It's not about scanners, but accessible.
And there's good news.
So this year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generation of the generation of the way, 65 versus 10 versus 10 surgery.
The cost of solar energy is 50 last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents the pill per hour compared with the 15 cents of national media.
And if we have any energy adult we also have water.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sanda took the Spanish space to the Earth, in 1990, after the Saturn country.
He took a famous picture. How is it called a famous picture.
"A single blue point.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, 99 percent is water water, two percent is ice, and we put up for 50 percent of the planet, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nationality, nature.
In a conversation with Dan Kanya this morning, one of the innovations of the critical -- I would like to share with you, I would like to share with you, the technology called Slimes -- maybe you know, it's the size of a small report.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of water in the day of any source water, water water, a legal, for less than two cents.
The President of Coca was just going to take a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have pollution that it will be, Coca will implement it in 200 countries of the planet.
This is a powerful innovation by this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the movies in the developing world in the end of 2011.
Think about that, that mass war has better mobile communities in the middle of Kenya than President Recent 25 years ago.
And to count with a smart mobile cell with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that the president Clinton is 15 years ago.
I live in a world of information of information and communication that nobody could have predicted yet.
Now better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- PMS video, images of books and music, technology technology -- now they are straight and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes up when they go up in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to encourage with the Force Formula something called the Prison Counter Communication, 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device with which they talk about, and because it has AIDS, you can take out of the finger of fear.
To win it has to make better dinosaurs than a critical medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no medical doctors, where the death rate is 25 and there are 13 percent workers of health.
When this sequence is a service of DNA or DNA that I don't recognize to call the health of health, and first of all, to avoid that happens to happen.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of adults.
I call it the billion a billion percent.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the seven billion of the center of the seven million.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people in line, connected.
For 2010, going from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds are never before you hate the global conversation.
What would you want these people?
What would you do? What should you be going to do?
And instead of an economic colony will have the biggest economic investigation of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars involved in global economy.
And they will get more health thanks to the Transportance, of a better education with the Alexander Accration and because of the use of 3D improvements and computer in the cloud will be more productive than never before.
What can you give us 300 million more members of humanity, healthy and productive memories?
What about a few voices never before you?
What if we give the options, where you give the options, you know, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
What are these 300 million billions?
And if they're contracts that we can't predict?
Something that I learned with the Prise TED is that small teams of their passion with a clear goal, you can do extraordinary things, things that they could only do the big corporations and governments could only do the big computers.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excited me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Jupide.
I came up in the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game in which people can take a sequence of and figure out the way that the protein will be.
Players determine structure and function.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a professional problem.
They have played with this college teachers between others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people were used and started playing it.
And it's shown that today the recognition of human patterns is better by putting proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the brain.
We have the capacity of the technology.
And we have 300 million new minds that will be used to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The correct of the part of the part.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1875.
Maybe they believed that I feel personally, but it wasn't like that.
I actually collect fish.
And I described one of them as a very completely."
It was the sea.
I thought it was a lot to the 1980s.
Now the fish is at the red list of the 1990.
But we've heard this story a lot of times, especially and other places, so that doesn't have anything of species.
But the case is that we still come to Galaxies.
We still think they're prisoners.
The faces still say they follow interactions.
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in 1998, studying a land in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could imagine.
I got a lot of with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't from there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The land was surrounded from paintings, and as you can see, from a few magicians.
There were a couple of centers of about 20 inches -- the black boat.
And the fish of this phone was very nice and happened for a good moment, so it was getting more than the middle in Ghana in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had been diagnosed to half of the fish.
They killed the five centers.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
Or it is, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was involved in the interaction of the art of art in the U.S.
In the 1970s, I started in the 1980s, Europe made a lot of development projects.
The professional development used to make countries that already had 100 periods, to put the industrial fish.
And this boat, pretty cold -- called the Muslim four.
I went out to fish in it, and we made studies in the south of the North China, and especially in the James of Japan.
So what we captured was something incredible.
We capture now, the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we captured were specifically, other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are tiny manipulations on a few rest of them, restaurants that are fish of coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the covered and then it was crazy.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then start the commercial fish.
The bottom is going to be a solid board bottom in this case, to be a local.
This is a dead tourism.
They didn't buy them because they were dead.
Once we capture a life.
I wasn't still hearing.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of rest is what the fish will come to a area where they never fish.
But it's not donationally.
We transform the world but we don't remember it.
We put the point of particular, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generate this something like this.
In the axis and we have good things, biodiversity -- a lot of drugs, the green of water.
And that changes with time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Every generation will use the images of the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extracting it forward.
The difference.
But they don't have the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the country of change.
And at the end of the end of a lot of rest metaphors.
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when depressing societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very hard, before exploration, is a little bit.
You don't lose any anti-productive animals.
You lose a little bit frankly.
Even if this doesn't feel like a big loss.
At the time, we focus on the big animals, and in a single sea of big fish.
They become little faster because we put them.
With time they get a few fish, but we think that is the point of participation.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, would be really different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a way before it is not the way they expect to have the evidence.
For example, the analysis that some of them presents, as they capture such as a little bit of fish in this area can't use or, by the general thing not use the scientists of fish because it's not scientifically."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in society societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can be able to have a private marine area.
Because with the marine areas, we really collect the past.
We remember the past that people can't connect because the point of part has cut up and it's pretty low.
That's for the people who can see a marine marine area and you can benefit from the vision that proposes, which allows them to draw their point of participation.
And what happens with people who can't do it because they don't have access -- like people in the Middle Media, for example.
I think there is the arts and the movie may be able to fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the White Ball.
A long time ago, there were white whales in the back of Charless, 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that mathematicians and the tricks are like "Talking."
And if you think of "The "Talking, if you think why people moved with the movie without talking about the story of Ponterness, why do you move with the images?
Because it takes something that in a sense, it's lost.
So my record, the only thing to give you, is Camera, making "The Esta low under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi, I am Kevin Allian, the generation of Turkey trends and I look at Justine videos.
It's true.
So today we will see why the videos are made and what important has that.
We all want to be stars. Celebration, content, commons -- when I was more young, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the Web video makes any of us, or our actions in a part of our global culture.
Any can do famous in the Internet in a sand.
They get over 45 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And from that, just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of personality, it gets infinite investment and work motivated.
How does that happen?
Three things -- the treatments of trends and participation communities and surprise factor.
Well, let's start with.
Berrie Valley: Oh, God, my God, my God.
God.
Wow.
Oh, which was us."
KA: Last year, Ben Scratch published this film video outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproductions in the population of the passion of the past.
Been not proposed to make a virtual video.
I just wanted to share a dance three.
That's what you do if it's called Most Mexico Bend.
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in energy.
So what happened here?
It was Jim Michael.
Jim Michael published this television that carries the video to population.
The transportations of trends like Jim Michael present us new and interesting things and they are deployed to a more amazing audience.
Recent Black Red --  -- you know, lives. You have to start the lives.   You all want to get the end of week, the end of weeks --  Virgin, lives.
"You know, "Green Blood is one of the most popular videos in the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
At the same thing that "The Dread was doing, this video seemed to have come out of anything.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was visualization, it's true.
And if you ask those other fish, they're also lives.
But what happened this day, this particular lives?
Well, I took her Twitter -- and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael Just New News, from Muslim Science Television, was one of the first people to make a joke on the video in Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of transportations are able to take a point of view, and they share it with a more amazing audience, applying the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10 paradigments of "Seven particular people.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parachute for each of the other days.
Unlike the industrial entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon doing it or doing something new with that.
"No Catheronic Catheroom, it's an approaching animation with a music again.
So this is it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare -- you know that there's a three hours that have seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw others see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke between the technology of the Internet.
There were responses.
Somebody did a version of the old one.
And then it was interesting.
Suddenly, I came up with a whole community community that made this will happen to be a little bit of something that we all can form part.
Because today we don't just enjoy we participated.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted "The "Death Drive or Red Black or "No Cathology?
What did you want to have written that institutions would be continued?
In a world where you get two days of video for minutes, just that really unique and unexpected can be to be the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy who protect the molecules in New York, anti-power that I don't interested too much.
Case Ninet: I was killed by not circular because there are often obstacles that are going to be able to be able to be able to match the disease.
KA: Thank you at the amazing effect and his humor Case, Castan Nine did that five million saw and understand their idea.
So this approach goes out for all of the new thing we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Been Valana, what does this mean?
Oh.
KA: What does this mean?
The transportation crisis, creative communities of participation -- the totally unexpected thing, are features of a new kind of media, of a new culture, to which we all have access and is the audience that define population.
As I said before, one of the current celebrations in the world, Justine Biobo, started in Isona.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we are all a little doubt of our popular culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they're just the current media, but define the training of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a short that is still reacting.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece -- a man running the work of all of a life.
It's a poet, a tradition, a man whose life had been supported in the only unit and freedom of his country.
Imagine it as the communities go into the Sanda, making the fact that his life had been totally in blood.
The words, for so long friends, now they were born.
It was represented in silence.
He died by the story.
He's my grandmother.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget their story.
My task was not to let that have been in sand, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to use them, but we support it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat in order to get out of the sea.
My mother, Man, was just 18 years ago when his father died and a market material and two small kids.
For her, life had gone into a single task -- the scale of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was incompleted for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a four years of four years that challenge the fiction -- a boat goes down to the device of the fish base.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was paradigments, violence and death.
As the majority of the adults -- my mother took a failure with come.
If you capture us, first we would take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine -- the protein supporting in every single wave and the horizontal and empty house.
I didn't remember the paradigments who came several times, but they were excited with the value of men in our boat or the engine dying and I couldn't raise for six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the Carden coast -- and the young man who collaborated and died and end the journey was too much for him, and the first hand that I tried to do for the men on the platform of the platform.
No man had the same back.
After three months in a refugee field, we were going to go in Melax.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in Francisco, a class of class open whose population is made of immigrants.
Unlike the middle subjects of the middle class -- whose existence I described, in Francisco, had no sense of the right.
The waves that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English engineering were involved between the people who had one thing in common. They were starting again.
My mother worked in farmers, then in a car mountain line, working six days, two days.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title in TED technology in information.
We were poor.
All the dollars were adapted, and started a strange tumor in English and math, not matter what you should be like, that generally was new rocket -- it always was a second hand.
Two pairs of media for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school to the tolerance, because I had to take six years.
And there were so many weird and painful stories on the "completes and some graphics, "Alive, go home.
At home, what?
Something in me was surrounded.
I was accompanied and a voice who said, "I'm going to support them.
My mother, my sister and I took on the same bed.
My mother was explored every night, but we told us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered picks, all of the boat.
And my task was to be stopped until their pending would start to get it out.
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be strategic and opened another business.
And women come with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and advanced and infinite, and girls translated between two worlds.
They were looking for substances and patients.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic structure student -- it was involved with what I stopped from myself.
In the other one, I was entered in private lives, totally little little bit of the violence, the arm of drugs and an income.
But a lot of it came up through the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of adult, they picked me the audience of the year.
And I was carried from a piece of the bomb to the other, but their edges didn't get up.
And so Len, president of French, was now so Leant, represented and social activity, invited to talk in sites that I had never heard name, and in houses whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the projects.
I didn't know how to use courses.
I didn't know how to talk about come.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to go back to the rural rules and the condition of life in an object subject -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end up the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling you about the day of each and getting doctors, the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I was reminded that I had now the same age that she had when we went up to the boat.
He had never been an option.
"He said, "You don't be what you don't.
So I talked about flying and education and education and detection to the markets and the depressions.
And the more frankly, I talked more about to talk more.
I met people from all the countries of life, many of them doing what they love, living in the border of the possible.
And even though I ended my limitation, I realized that I couldn't stay in a battery career.
I had to have another piece of the break.
And I realized at the same time that it's good to be a discovery, a recent record, new in the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that will be grateful -- maybe a back of the boat.
Because it can easily be in the way that it can easily mean the hours, can easily mean to accept the presence of your provide.
I gave the enough steps out of my conflict area to know that, yes, that the world is demonstrated, but not the way we think.
You might not have been allowed to be all absolutely advanced.
There was an energy there, an embarrassing optimism, a rare microscope of humanity and value.
So I kept my intelligence.
I played a little group of people for who the language can't do was a terrible challenge.
For a year we didn't have a center.
At the end of every day, I did a giant wave of sound that we all share.
We worked up until the night.
Most of our ideas were local, but some brilliant stories, and we open on it.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My hearts again.
Three months later, I had moved up, and the advantage continued on.
Before I ended up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where Congress was the social normal and the local Manda was the person who matters.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died little after she was born.
The mother came up.
At the age of 17 became a content of a Manda whose mother put it.
No support of his husband caused a revolution when you give it up and take the cause of it, and much more back caused when you go.
You can't make it show to be area.
I was in the straight in the fourth of a hotel in Sweden when she died, at a 100 miles in Mexico.
I looked through the mammal of the diagnostic student, and I saw it on the other side.
I knew he had come to stop.
My mother called minutes later.
days later, we went to a study in Francisco and we sat around his atmosphere.
We told the stories and we make sure we were still with it.
At night a monkey came and told us that I had to close the atmosphere.
My mother asked us to sit his hand.
I asked the monkey, "Why your hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so free."
Because you have taken his hand from the morning, he said.
Don't have someone.
If there is a nerve in our family, that journey through women.
Because we were and how life formed us, now we can see that men who had come to our lives would have been frustrated.
The death would have accepted easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could do that for it?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a test in their lives, supporting worth in every single wave -- the vision real reaction of the engine -- the horizontal view that doesn't make any warming anyway?
I don't know.
But if I could give you a little bit and look at it, I would do it.
Three Newspaper and also the mother of this is today here today, in the fourth or to take it off.
My story starts in Random about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the star sky, with the Manda State Stone.
We were turning out how nothing has changed from the time of the old Indian Indian English "The Malacan.
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel out to a car, and we had the sky.
Now we do it with advances.
And at that time when Arabia, the great Indian print printed, he had sense, he would take a rain and with a flag to the ground, it was a water.
Now we do the same with tallest and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machine had replaced magic.
And that was a lot.
Every time I felt a little more technology.
I was forced this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and learn a strange if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't bring my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic -- not kill it.
And I was a little bit of my grandfather recording their ball plant plant.
And this technological piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a dead door to a world full of images, paradigments and nature in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones and the colors of luxury and the cameras are that we are.
It was our inspiration of us.
So I was raised, I brought up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic instead of killing it.
I illustrate books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the IPh I saw a natural device device to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
I'll bring the text with the image, animation, sound and car.
The narrative becomes more multiple.
But what does that look like?
I'm about to launch Khand, an interactive application for iPhone.
He says, "I put your fingers on every light.
And so --  He says, "This box is a standard -- I write my name.
And so I get a character of the book.
In several moments I get a letter -- the iPhone knows where I live thanks to the GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner girl is excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean materials and drugs but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we open from children.
For some reason, the lights in a French were always supporting me.
So over here, we have to include the iPhone to release the lungs.
And really, they raise your way on what the book.
Another idea that was fascinated to me was that all a galaxy is coming on a balloon.
So here, every book and every world is transformed in a block that I face to this magic device in the space.
And this opens a map.
In every book of phantom has always been maps but they have been static map.
This is a map that grows up, fush and I went through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book as well.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content.
These are the applications.
We've all heard of the hands and the financial bones, but how many people outside India know their Indian contracts, the advertising?
These poor partners have been trapped in the Caria cameras for military, in an old and the fourth book.
So we are bringing them back in a content food story.
In a story that treat current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about environmental crisis, one of the last 10 years has been that children have been broken, put their countries, they haven't come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out to the outside, take the camera or the iPhone, and collect images of different natural objects.
And I had a lot of colleagues, steps, pieces, pieces and contents.
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to get this right of the childhood that you have to go out, and in a chapter to take a picture to a flower and then take it.
In another chapter -- you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then take it.
So this is a digital collection of pictures that then you can put in the Web.
A kid of London puts a picture of a shoot and says, "Oh, today I saw a stranger."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And you create this kind of social network at a collection of digital pictures that have been taking up.
Within the various connection of the magic between magic and Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we have an interaction where you go out with the iPhone and the video and the video and the video and the video and the video is actually a group of animals that are going on on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of holes.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and put them up to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are trained with technology and magic and technology and technology are closer to another.
Let's take the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and joy and family love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why a lot of health projects fail.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did in the Ruser University was to figure out a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she took a little piece of coffee or you and asked patients, family and known to patients and what happens?
How can we help it?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all of all, but most of the health projects face -- because we stop listening.
This is my Switzerland school. It's a very simple thing.
It has a piece of track and started.
All the morning, I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 Good.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect me, I send my information to Google Hello.
And my medical doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem, not at the same time that it needs carbon assistance or some organization of that stage, but to see it down.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over four seconds in Twitter.
So every morning I connected to my school Silence and before I go back to my car, people start to talk to me, Lustin, today I think you need a linear lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the walls used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity and also for patients to stop from fire.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people from their chair and together develop some religious activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week will be available.
This little man connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people could be able to be able to take their artistic pressure, send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, they go back to the control and to be capitalists of their own boat, but we also can help us to the care of health because of the challenges that we face -- like the destruction of the cost of medical attention and democracy of demand and other issues.
It will make techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by corruption.
And one of the things we did want to share with you with you with a video.
We all have control controls in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our cells.
We know perfectly where the car boxes are in Maria.
They also are all the galaxies.
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closer TED to help this patient.
We asked but no one know.
No one knows where the TED saved lives at this moment.
What we did was to do corruption in the Boston countries.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to say, you see a DDA, please send it up, and when it is open, because sometimes they open in hours of office and others are closed.
And more than 10 DDA were already presented in the Boston countries.
The next step was looking for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPhone.
We created an app for Laura, really announced, to find these DDA.
And every time you are at the city of Maria and someone collection, you can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their microscope of Microsoft to find the less close DNA, which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this, not just as TED U.S. who is the name of the product, but also like Asmanians.
And we want to start to start at the world level.
We're driving all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and act as a center for the Drew collection around the world.
Every time you are values and someone color, it can be a part or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DDA.
They might be a message of message or people of phone, for example, to see if the DNA who shows is still in their place.
Please help us in this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph friend.
Or is it the photograph?
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest on the photograph was depressed with my first digital camera at 15 years.
It was mixed with my passion before the drawing -- but it was a little bit different, because when you use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ended up when the pulps present.
For me the photograph had more than to do with being in the right place, at the time.
I looked like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the pulp.
Pictures like this -- a building in a very traditional career.
But it has an unexpected subject.
And despite it, it keeps a level of reality.
Or pictures like these -- dark and colors and color at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of reality.
And when I say really professional say.
Because, of course, it's not something that I can capture but I always want it to seem to have been captured in some way as a photograph.
pictures where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capture an idea to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem really?
Are the details or colors?
Do you invent the light.
What do you create information?
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a biological surface.
It's actually not about whether it's real, but what we think is real.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a representation of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly amazing objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that seems three-dimensional as if you exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's get the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that really doesn't have sense.
And I see the same process when I combine pictures.
It turns really to combine different reality.
And the things that make a picture seem to do is that they are those where we don't even think, the things that surround us in our everyday life.
But when you combine pictures is very important to consider it, because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve real results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are just taken with these recording, they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect universe.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
I could think this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is manipulated.
But this image is completely compared by pictures of different places.
In the person I think it's easier to create a place that I find it because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to play it, to find the different places for the pieces of the report.
For example, the fish was captured in a fish journey.
The costs are from a different place.
The subjective part was captured in a piece of piece.
And yes, I even made the house on the top of the island for it to seem more surface.
So to get a real result to do I think it makes a planning flow.
It always starts with a bone, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well thinking.
If you make a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at the very real time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please can put it.
It's a diagram that I took from a car met.
I don't really interesting to show you the details but the general species.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the potential of RIS microscopes -- the potential of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this, like a lot of other ones that we used to see, is a kind of straight line in a straight scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in the record scale.
I'm talking about technology with self-expected corrections is something new.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please get the lights.
I would need more intense because writing on paper.
Why do we make technology crowds in all a school scales?
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where we say, these are the years, or some of the time of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to thank you, the diagram would look like a ridiculous thing.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you know, for example, some other technology, as the transport -- in a self-interesting curve would be very long, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you give a cultural change.
If technology technology would get as fast as the members, last morning, we could take a tail and be in Tony in 200 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that room.
There are no pressure in the history of the technological development of a recorded growth that every few years advertise of magnitude.
The question I want to plan is -- looking at these exponential curves, we see that they don't follow extremely.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical thing like this until I cut something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic -- that's why I think maybe something like this.
So we will now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition of what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way that he applied the world?
What new state does the world?
The transition seems very, very curious if we are in it.
I remember that the future happened in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what happened in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 200 year.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been depressed, year after year, along my life.
But I think it's supposed to feel that something is happening.
It happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different that we are doing today doesn't have any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that we experience it.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit of things that don't have a lot to do with technology and information.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image has sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we took up about 250 million years when the Earth was a big star rock with a lot of chemicals that flow around it.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with ARI. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and it is that, at that time, he had floating a few actions of oil with all kinds of chemical needs on their inside.
Some of those oil leaves told a particular combination of chemicals that made them increase materials from the outside and so the pictures grew up.
And they started to disappear.
In a certain sense, those were the most primitive cell forms that are more principled.
But those pictures were not alive, in the current sense, because every one of them has a headline of chemical recording.
And every time they divide that they were able to have a final distribution of the chemicals that they have.
So every piece was a little bit different.
In fact, the pictures that somehow they were designed by being better than the time to increase the common chemicals -- they grow more, they were getting more chemicals and they divide more.
They generally lived more time, they were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things were translated when these pictures learned the trick of architecture.
In some way that we don't understand very well these goals learned to store information.
They learned to get information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they came out in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to replicate it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since that evolved 250 million years ago.
Our recording, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every life is exposed to exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun. We can now write things with this code.
So here I have 100 billion blocks of white dust that try to hide people from the according to the according.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this photograph of DNA and the approaching 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the presents, in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a flower would have put it in a virus and would have been waiting on the room.
What was the next step?
I would write DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells have been happy another billion years.
But then another great thing happened in which things were very different and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information by making the information of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid the penision and they applied them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many restaurants to the penicilline because bacteria are communicate.
This communication gave you a place to make communities that, in a way, they were together in that, and they were established a sense.
So in that way they survive or failed together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were represented more and failed by evolution.
And the point of influence happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they went together and decided to write all the recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next thing for life took other billion years.
And in that stage we have molecular communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a molecular community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't go without the heart, or the muscles, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and they produced more interesting levels than cell -- something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to absorb information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process in community.
It's the neural structures.
neurons are the applications that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started specifically in the community being the responsible structures of recording, understanding and transform information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary self-interest.
Because at that moment as individuals -- the learning was connected to the direction of an organism and not the evolutionary time.
So an organism could say, for example, learning to not eat a certain sentence because I knew bad and found the last time that I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these projections of information processing that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that they started that fragile.
So the fact that the nervous system would build those information structures that are really exciting the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most represented version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing investment.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea to go in the head.
I am here being sitting here by getting a few graduates and, with lucky, building a similar idea, empty and conflict, in their heads that had a certain analogy with me.
But we take something very complicated, we become sound in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as an organism.
In fact, as humans, we've started to make antibiotics.
Now we go through similar periods to the molecular organisms -- we will absorb our record methods and presentation and information process.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The phone, the information, the video of video -- CO2, and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that gives us something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than what we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microscopes.
You saw the evolutionary example of The Tom in which I produced some evolution with the political program, to our eyes.
And now we've accepted the scale of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about a billion years every one.
The next stage, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next one, language etc., they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electricity, it seems just a few decades.
The process is responsible? I guess that anti-control is the right word to name something that accelerate their own change of change.
The more change, faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is represented.
But I won the life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that I work to design them would not be possible without the recent information advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible to me in conventional way.
I don't know it does every transition in that machine machine.
There are thousands of million.
Instead of that, with the Destructions of Their Machines, we think a level of authority, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you could not be able to get a lot further and faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes we have methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using last, is the evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that works on the scale of the microscopes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a strategy self-interest sequence of institutions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of institutions of instruments.
Can you pick these sequences of instruments in the land, except all those programs and take those who are more about what we want to do?
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to figure numbers to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to get up numbers.
Of course, it's a little bit likely to be a little bit of architecture services of institutions, they open numbers, so none of them did.
But one of course, I could make two numbers in the right order.
And I said, "Would you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task?
So let's take those and empower the rest of the rest of it.
And now we collect the ones that are better to open the numbers.
And we go back to them by following a process of angiogenesis to sex.
Let's take two programs -- which will get children, which are investigating subjects, and that children are having the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the process.
Calified again.
It involves some musicians.
And it tries again and replace it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few minutes.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that organize numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written in hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They are dark programs.
But they get the computer.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a hundred of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend to do it.
Once I was in a 177 with Martin Minister and it takes me a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "This plane has hundreds of thousands of parts that work together to offer a safe flight. You don't feel transportation."
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make a different design process.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choice that's there.
In that sense, it goes from us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so I can pick up these programs much faster.
Or, it's represented.
The thing is getting faster and that's why I think it seems so conflict.
Because all these technologies are represented.
We're standing on.
And we are at a moment that we are in the animal organisms when they became multiple.
We are the love and we can't understand what dinosaurs are doing.
We're at the point of influence.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very architectural from our part to think we're the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was eliminated.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've chosen enough time to allow me to be a part of my false budget in that.
Before I treat the issue of my talk, let's talk a little bit of biologists.
Why not?
We are close to the end, the World Series.
We love the basic, right?
Building is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go back to the rules, talk about the statistics and use them to form a great team team.
I will focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called battery average.
And we talked about 300 of a battery that battery based.
That means that the banking battery entirely, three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being adapted, and anyone who tries to launch it to the first base -- it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be saved.
Three attempts of 10.
You know how they call a 300 battle in the Great Lines?
Well, really, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a band of bandants of 400,000 banks.
By the way, that is someone that from 10 pollen, another four.
Legacy -- like the Leadershar Times, the last player of the Law Law of Bible to explore more 400 pollen in a regular temperature.
Now let's bring this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose that they have approaches and they are developed to a surgeon that has a 400 record in a supply.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a class place and a being wanted to be wanted to have two corrupting coral artists and his family doctor is sent to a carbon whose record in analysis is 200 of 200 percent.
But do you know something?
She is getting improved by this year.
And their actions have been 250.
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think that should be the average of any heart surgeon or architectural surgeon of a fighting or a general object?
1,000 very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the actions of a good surgeon of a doctor or a death of dark.
What we do, though, is to send them to the world, and I was including, with the management of being perfect.
You know, you know, they eat a mistake and presentation to figure out how to do well.
That was the message that I ended up when I was in the middle of medicine.
I was a computer study.
Once a company in the high school said that Brian Gollogia studied until a blood example.
Which is that.
I studied in my little design, in the resistance of the German hospital of Total, not far from here.
And I learned everything of memory.
From my kind of antibiotics, I mentioned the origin and the muscle work, the radiation of every art that comes out of the shoot, the different difference and not home.
And I even met the difference of the difference about how to capture the regional trade activity.
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated with honest.
And energy of medicine school with the printing of that if I was looking at everything, then I would know everything, or the most possible, close to all, because I would show me from mistakes.
And it worked for a time, until I met the Drawing sand.
I was resistant in a college hospital here, in Toron when they brought up the Draw sand to the emergency service where I worked on.
At the time I was stuck on the carbon service.
And when emergency came up to a carbon to get me to get to that patient.
And to report the research of resistance.
When I saw the Drawing sand, I was slide.
I heard a remote sound.
And when I touched it, I heard a surrounding sound in both sides -- which was inspired to me an consumer heart infrastructure.
In these conditions the heart stop working, and instead of board the blood down, the blood goes to the lungs, these are filled from blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose.
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would give him.
He gave him application and medicine to avoid the pressure in their heart.
I gave her diagnosis, the water planes, so that I could eliminate liquid literature.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And there was when I started the first mistake. He sent it to his house.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent it to his house without talking to the resistance of resistance.
I didn't take the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and put it with him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to get completely complex information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a restaurant that requires constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility to take responsibility that I could take care of my patients without even telling my boss without even to hire me.
The second mistake I bought was worse.
When I send it to his house, I didn't put attention to a voice in my interest that said, "Google, it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so inspired that until I asked the nurse that I had come to the Draw sand, "Do you think it's good if you go to your house.
And the nurse thought and then he said with total nature, "Yes, I think it will be good.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So I signed the high, and the ambulance together with the paradigments took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad presentation in the story.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I moved up to leave the hospital and walked into the space where I was my car to go home. At that moment I did something that I don't do normally.
I spent for the emergency of the way to home.
And there another nurse -- not that I had a sand of Drawing Draw before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors are terrified.
Other species also fear them too, but there is a particular piece of emotion, and it is that we see the physical patients.
The three words are accessible?
"Do you agree from the patient that sent your house.
I asked the other way with total nature.
"Well, she got back, with the same kind of voice.
She was good.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At the end of a time to have reached his house, after I gave him the high -- it suffered a collaboration and his family called the 1991, the paradigments brought it to emergency with an artificial pressure of 50 miles of Holly, which means a severe sheet.
I was just represented and I was blue.
The percentage of the emergency has got all their resources.
They gave him medicine to get the artificial pressure.
And they put an artificial responsibility.
I was connected and help to the model.
I had a mind of feelings because then they were going to be struggling in intensive therapy and waiting against all hope that would be recognized.
And in the two or three days next was evidence that I would never expect.
He had an incredible brain day.
The family.
And in eight or nine days, they turned out what was happening.
And at the novel day, they left it to go. The Drawing sand, hope, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next week, I kept up for it, and I experienced for the first time the marketing market that exists in our medical culture, and I felt like, and I was just able to feel that self-interest because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You do the parents and never more eating that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a conversation.
The male shame that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad by inside.
It's the one that tells us not that that we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt like that.
And it was not for my boss -- he was a lot.
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I was able to put things and make sure that they wouldn't give me.
And I kept doing those questions.
Why didn't I ask my child? Why did it send her home.
And in my worst moments, why did I eat a stranger strange?
Why did I choose medicine?
Shortly that feeling was discovering.
And I started feeling better.
And in a non-percent day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun and asked me if I feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I had the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes -- I would have to take those voices.
And so it was.
I went back to work.
But he went back to happen.
Two years later, it was helped in the emergency department in a community hospital to the north of Toron, and I received a 25 years with a pain in the garage.
I was very busy and appropriate.
And he was sitting here.
And I looked at his garage, I was a little collaborative.
He was prepared and sent it to his house.
But as he said to the door followed by looking at his garage.
Two days later, when I came to do my grade change, my boss asked me to talk to me with the office in their office.
And he made the three words, you remember you?
Remember the patient that I saw for a pain in the garage.
So he went back and I didn't have a strategic factory.
I had a potential approach called the players.
You can find it in Google -- it's an infection, not from the garage, but in the top, it can cause the top of those go.
He was fortunately, it didn't fail.
It is an anti-power antibiotic and recorded to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and reproductions, then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same kind of infrastructure, not diagnosed approaches.
And it's a great effort -- especially working in a hospital, because it goes to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a discovery.
One of them I thought I had a real cell.
They order a robot of robots but it turned out, a colleague that was coming back to the patient perceived a certain sensitivity in the right bottom and called the surgery.
The other patient was with a lot of death.
I read liquid to represent and I asked my colleague to reveal it.
I was sent up and to notice a certain sense on the right bottom, called the surgery.
Both of them were operating and they became fine.
But every case, I was showing me, I was disappeared.
But I would like to tell you that I eat the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a park.
The most significant have been for the last five years.
Just organized and without support.
And here is the problem, if I can't release and talk about my mistakes if I can't find the voice that I really tell me what happens to me, how can I share this with my colleagues?
How do I teach you this to do not eat the same fragiles?
If I go into a place like this, I wouldn't have idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after factory, after failure?
Of course you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but they won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also -- that a transportation in my hospital took the wrong leg, believe it would have difficulty to look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total negative of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two possibilities, the ones who eat mistakes and the ones who don't do -- the ones that are not going to sleep and the ones who have a lot of results and the ones who have results of them.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction as an antibiotics that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we get out of medicine to people who eat mistakes -- will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of dependence and medical permission, I've made a personal study of bad medical prison and medical mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the State State to my program, "Good Court, Black Arth Brazil, Black Arthur Brazil."
And what I learned is that mistakes are construction.
We work on a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one of 10 percent drugs in the hospital are wrong, or distribution is not right -- in a system where the international infections are increasingly more and more numbers, providing expensive and death.
In this country, they die 24 centers for eventually electricity drugs.
The U.S. Institute in the United States started 100 dollars.
In both cases, it's all about barbarian survival, because we're not going to get the problem as we should be.
And so they're the things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years old, and we don't accept us.
The privilege of the dream invited everything.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive challenges that allow us to make a perfect story of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on the chest, it comes up with cheap eyes and with angle and all of a sudden, my story is able to respond.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot -- I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't raise their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are invisible.
So if we take the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, not to be no one.
And with what people don't want to talk about their biggest cases.
In my program, "Gravitan and black art, it's a computer say, "This is my worst error, I would tell you all of the death to the head of heart surgery -- this is my worst error, blood, ball, what are your freedoms, and he would run the microphone to them.
And their students were going to stop up, they would go back the head and they were going to be able to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You want to say, "Look, don't eat the same error."
They need a context where you can do it.
They need a resistant medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The residential doctor is human, you know human, and it does not get out of their mistakes -- but it is forced to learn from what happened to teach others.
They share their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
I look at the mistakes of other people not with the intensity of them, but in a love way and support for everyone to benefit it.
And I work in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings will draw the system, and when this happens, you eat mistakes of time in when this happens.
My name is Brian Golden.
I'm a resistant doctor.
I'm human, I eat mistakes.
And I feel a lot of it, but I feel so effort to learn something that can transform others.
I don't know what to think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week.
I did a little bit more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to pick up an average American American, are about 70 a day.
It doesn't make a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers came up with the different tasks that are determined by these executives and the time they started to make decisions related with those tasks.
They found that, in average, they add 135 jobs a week.
Natural, each work includes a lot of decisions.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent received one hour or more of your time.
Now think about their elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the night of nine minutes, and how many of the hour of an hour.
How does the way you handle those decisions.
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of activity, choose to the opportunity of options.
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I am blind -- they raise your hand just if you want to take cards.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive by favor by a painting.
And now my first question of the day, are they ready to hear about the problem of operations of operations?
Thank you.
And being a graduate student of the University of Stanford, I found this supermarket level of level, very high, at least in that time was very sophisticated at least in that time.
It's called Dreadings.
It was almost like going to a paradigm park.
There were like 250 different kinds of music and it was visited, over 500 different types of drugs and versions and a few of the stranger water, and this was when we took water water.
I loved to go to that store, but in a way I asked myself, why never buy anything.
This is the top of the old office.
They had more than 75 different class, including the ones that were in step box that came from military trees.
Once I decided to visit the gene and asked him, "Do it work a good strategy of offering all these choices?
He pointed me up the bases full of tribes that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the memories.
Passion.
They had 350 different classes.
We put a bridge to stop, right to the training of the store.
We put out there of six seats, or 24 different sands and we looked at two things, first of all, where people were willing to stop to stop the memory?
More people were left when there was 24 -- 60 percent, that when there were only six -- 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a thing of memory.
Here we find the opposite effect.
What they stopped when there was 24 only three percent came to buy memory.
What they were paid when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought memory.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy memory if they found six -- that if they found 24 percent.
Well, to decide that we don't buy memorial we probably become a good thing to build the line, but it turns out that the problem of the opportunity of choice affects us in the decision of concerned decisions.
We decided not to decide -- even when this doesn't convince us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings now.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with New Hunger, Emita Kanya and Sea Jane, where we look at the decisions about savings for the role of about a million Americans -- in between 500 planets of this country.
We would interested to see if the number of forests available in planets of savings for training, the 400 program programmed people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a corporation.
We had 760 planets that were coming from two to 50 different choices.
We found that how much more was the number of forest forests, there were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes -- we see that in the planets that offer two forests, the participation rate was 70 or more, not as high as he would like it.
And in the planets that they offered about 60 forests, the particle rate went up to the 60th percent.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate -- when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the ones who decided to participate -- the more it was the number of choices, more people were involved to avoid actions or the forests of investment.
In the way there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financials.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would remember to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they put the decision -- that they apply it even when this goes against the interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in the funding and health.
They are more likely to choose less satellites, even though you get better.
The main reason is that we get to look at that giant variety of mass music, musical and memory, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare and hire and choose from that amazing experience.
So today, I want to give you four simple techniques that we've taught in a form or another, in different research, so they can teach their business.
The first is, Correct.
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always moved when I say, "Are "I going to come."
They worry about losing space in the end.
But actually what we're seeing more and more and more and more is that if you decide to cut out of contract concerned choices -- there will be an increase in the windows -- you will get a better experience in choice.
When I processed the Galaxie and Galaxie went from 26 different types of Height and Shanghairs to 15 -- they saw an increase of 10 percent.
When Google Cartoon calls the products for cats of cats that are less sold -- they took up the users in 87, for two careers, higher windows and less costs.
You know that the supermarkets of today, in average, they offer 45 products.
In a Martin store, you get about 100 products.
But the novel tends bigger in the current world is Alex and offers only 150 products -- a kind of sale sand on the top.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have grown about how to handle better choices is the planet of David Laborator, the Harvard program.
All the employees of Harvard are automatically increased to a search of life.
And they really want to pick up, you give them 20 forests, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to cut up.
These are all important options.
The first thing I do is to ask the employees -- to tell you the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't difference, you can't make it their clients."
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Garden.
He told me that I would be willing to offer the people from this audience a few vaccines with everything paid to the world's most beautiful career.
Here, a description.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give you a supply if you're ready to take a back of Garden.
"Particular supermarkets? Okay. Any who's ready to accept the old.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that view?
I think it actually came up to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first room, which in the second one, but I can go to you and say they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the option of options.
For people to understand the differences between choices -- they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that consequences must feel like a very, very concrete way.
Why do people spend 15 percent to 30 percent more in average, when you use carbon cards or creation, that when you use effective?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shellow Bender and Salaria President, about the personal Indian personal works that worked in 1999, these people were in a meeting where they were adapting to a 400 plan.
That meeting, that we built exactly as a supported way, we did a little disaster.
What we did was we got to the person who would think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this machine there was an increase in the 20th percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings of savings from four.
The third technique is California.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a record paradigm.
We saw that in the Supermarkets Legancy throughout the right of the northern correct, the experience of magazine can continue from 33 different types to 66.
But you know?
Because the capital tells me how to define it.
These are two pieces of roles.
One is called Japan and the other, "Shoot."
If you think the one on the left is Syne and the right is Japan, they have a painting.
"Particular supermarkets? Well, there are some of them.
If you think the one on the left is Japan and the right is Syna -- they have a painting.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Japan and the right of the right is Synest. But you know something?
This spiritual school is totally intelligent.
Cates need to indicate something to the collection, not that they define them.
You often see this problem with those huge finance list.
What are you informationally?
My fourth career care? To drive complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if we just simulate it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity funny.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very complicated decision, the company of a car.
This is a German factory of cars that allows it to be providing.
You have to take 60 decisions.
And these decisions would come in the number of choices that offers each one.
Colors, colors outside of the car. I have 50 possibilities.
Mother, box box, four options.
What I'm going to do is to look at the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choices -- 55 colors, a few boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go out of a few choices -- four boxes to 50 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look like?
How involved you are.
If you act always the button in every decision in every decision, this indicates that they're surprised, or it is, we're losing them.
We found that the ones who are going from many choices to time, they operate the button for the effect over and again, and another more.
We lose them.
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to add the order where information.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to pick up.
Even though the charge box is not saying anything about the predictions of the inner direction, in all ways to get to choose us.
We have a product that we're building that we now have more supporting with the process.
To show up.
I've talked about four techniques to measure the problem of the options of options, Correct, completely eliminating extraordinary antibiotics, controlled, to make it real -- contract, and we can make more characters with less choices, to drive complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help us handle antibiotics, or better for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who are looking at them.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to school.
And the more expensive we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 19th years, in the United East American Communication, if you had a machine to write had to break it into the government.
He had to get a text of example of example in the machine.
And this is that the government could cut the origin of text.
If you found a desk with the right message they could cut the back to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't know that someone could do this, how much it would limit the freedom of expression.
We will never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a color printing of any big manufacturing and print a page, that page will end up having a few early yellow dots in every page that follow them on one and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to get a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you see what happens in the world in line we can add the attacks according to their attentions.
There are three main groups.
They're the circles.
Like Mr. Diminish Golden Golden from the city of King, in America.
The cell cell is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the circles to win a lot of money, income angers.
There are really many cases of millions in line, multiple, who won money with their attacks.
This is Labilia Turkey, from Tarria, State.
This is Allian Google.
This is Stephen San.
This is Britain South.
These are Martin Anderson: Tartan American etc., etc.
These guys do their forests in line but they do it by illegal media by the barrier of our minds when we buy online, or steal our key to get information from our cars when we buy in an infected computer.
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, I know the Swiss account of this Mr. Same Japan, and this account had 14 million dollars when it was connected.
Mr. Japan -- so supply -- you know his paradigm.
And I say today is more likely than any of us to be victims of a crime than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad in worse.
In the future, most of them will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we see today is not motivated by money.
There is another thing that moves them, they motivate the proteins -- they motivate the opportunities, they motivate the risks.
groups like Annument have been developed in the last 12 months that are going on in the last 12 months in the line.
Those are the three main attacks, the criminals that do it by money, the associations like Angeles who do it to protect and the last group are the national states the governments that they are.
And then we see cases like Dinner.
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
Disconduct is an authority of careful countries or actually it was.
Depression the last street because of a sand.
They survey the security of the site and they put a biomaterial.
Last week, I said, in a meeting with representative government representations, I asked one of the leaders if they had planned the death of people to cause the attack to Dinner.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of this?
Discondint is a conscious authority.
They sell certainly.
What do the certain conservations?
Well, you need if you have a website with hospitals, services considered SSperces, services like Google.
I save that you get an foreign contract authority.
And they have copying conservative.
And in the case of Dinister happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Privilege, and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt."
Well, in Egypt in Egypt the sense of the political school self-surprise school in Auran 2011, and during the sand of the building, they had a lot of paper.
And between those papers was this card standard "Spot."
And within that card there was notes of a company with Seven in Germany who had sold the government of the tools to interact a big scale of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 250 dollars to the European government.
The top of the company is right here.
Or it is, Western governments provide tools to the total governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago was found the Truth Scotting, a transportation used by the official government office to investigate their own citizens.
If you are supposed in a very good, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is intervential.
But today it goes beyond there.
It's interested the connection to the Internet.
They will use even tools like the Truth Congress to influence our computer with a transportation to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discovery discovery, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems something bad, but I don't really affect me because I'm a honest city.
Why would you worry about?
I have nothing to control.
And that argument doesn't have sense.
It's in play.
Private is not described.
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have to have today, to be forever.
Do we get blind in any future government, in a strategy that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South National Park.
These are the cows of my dad -- to the bottom, and behind the course, the National Park.
The National Park.
And depressions, like the legs, they follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our walk.
This is one of the ones who killed over the night, and so soon we took up in the morning, and we found it very bad because it was the only time we had.
My community, the machines, we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to pass them, and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of leaders.
They die them are wars that protect our community and the wall, and they're also molecules with the problem.
So they kill laws.
This is one of the six laws that killed in National.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, in the six to nine years, is responsible from his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire. Because I thought the laws gave them fear.
But I realized that it was actually not serious because I even helped the laws to see the law state.
I didn't get up. He continued.
A second idea was to use a space.
I was trying to get the laws to believe that I was near the state.
But the laws are very smart --  they came up with the first day and saw the space, and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving up, it's always here.  So they jumped and killed animals.
So one night was walking around the street with a attack and that day the laws didn't come from.
I discovered that lions have fear to the light that moves up.
So I had an idea.
And I got a interview that you will have to be able to get up and take the lights out.
And this is a little light of a red line.
America everything.
And as you can see, the solar role carries the battery and the battery surveys the electricity to the little Indian box -- I call it a transportation.
And the Indian box makes the lights detect.
As you can see, the bombs give out there, because that's where the lions come from.
And this is how you see the laws when you come from night.
The lights are standing up and go to the laws so you think I'm walking through the state, but I am running on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got to have problems with the laws.
And the home houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed them a lot of animals and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them. You can see the background, these are the lights for law.
Since then, I've been inspired in seven houses in my community, and they're looking at a lot.
And my idea is also used by the whole Kenya, to bring other devices like shoes, legal, and it's also using to support the flames of gravity.
Thank you to this invention -- I had the order to get a short in one of the best schools of Kenya, International Brother School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping me go back and connection.
I even took my friends to my community and we put lights in the houses that they don't have them, and I teach you how to put them.
So a year ago, it was just a child in the proster of my father, and I used to look at the values of my father, and I used to see that some day would be inside one.
And today I am.
I got the opportunity to come up with the first time to TED.
My big dream is to come to be an engineer, and pilot when I grew up.
I used to hate the legs, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the laws -- we can be with the lions without any conflict.
She counts -- what in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you get a short. Richard Turkey, yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical institutions.
What's the next in your list.
RM: My next invention is -- I want to make an electric close -- CA: A close to electricity.
RM: I know that they were already invented the electric letters, but I want to do the mine.
CA: You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, right? Rich -- I tried it before, but I tried to get a carbon --  CA: At the foot of the cand. Richard Turkey, you're a big thing.
We're going to add in every step that you know, friend me.
Thank you very much. RM: Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up with a song called "The Nontabate Development."
And I felt very powerful.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Jim RIM, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South North America, Japan is the enemy.
Even though sometimes I asked me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public exploration.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never spent man.
But one day, in 1999, my mom brought home a letter of my brother company.
And he said, "When you read this, the five members of family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're recorded together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die.
I was very sand.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't draw from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a scale child in their arms looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one helped them because they were very concerned about taking them and their families.
A huge man brought up to North Korea in the middle of the 1990s.
At the end, more than a million neurons died during the shoulder, and only few of them survived by eating passion, insects and tree.
They were also made more and more frankly, the energy costs -- all of my around was completely to dark in the night except by the lights of the sea in China, just running the river from my house.
I always asked why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared with the neighbors.
This is the Ride Rid, which is self-estem between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very anti-power in certain points, allowing normal to cross secret.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how from North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of the female was sent to China to live with distant parts.
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life is as a northern reproduction.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous because the North refugees in China were considered incredible immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be represented to a horrible destiny.
One day, my worst painting was done, when I went up by the Chinese police and introduced me in the police space.
Somebody had taken me to be northern -- then they were involved my skills in the Chinese language and made me many questions.
I was sadded.
I thought my heart was going to explore.
If it didn't seem nature, it could be completely completely and depressed.
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and I asked questions.
At the end of the interaction an office said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not North."
And they left me to go. It was a military.
Some neurons in China look at the extra books in Chinese.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and depressing.
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though they had captured them, they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These normals didn't have so much luck.
Every year, innovative normals are captured in China and depressed to North Korea, where they are correctly, collected or explored in public.
Even though I was forced in speed, many other neurons have been so lucky.
It is tragic that the neurons have to hide their identity and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all the world can be in a institution.
This is why after 10 years of controlled my identity, I've decided to go back to South South South South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
I'm going to be in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what I expect.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South South.
We are all corrosors, but in the inside, we've got to be very different because of seven years of diversity.
Even you go through an identity crisis.
am I surgery or northern?
Where am I that? Who am I that?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with proud of me.
Even though to adapt to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan -- I started studying for the end of income to college.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I got a clear call.
The North Korea, the North Korea interact a lot of money that sent my family, and as a career, my family was going to be replaced to force to the force to a collective location in the outside.
They had to be able to be done.
And so I started planning how to help you escape it.
The North online has to travel long distance on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So I took a flight to China and I was trained to the border with North North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak China, I had to get them, somehow for more than three miles through China and then through South Asia.
The journey in bus took a week, and we almost went through several times.
Once our bus was determined and advertised by a Chinese police office.
I asked all of all of all, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand China, I thought my family was going to be arrainable.
When the Chinese office came up to my family, I immediately put me up and I told him that they were surrounding people who was setting up.
I looked at me, but unfortunately, I believed me.
We did all the way to the Warren front.
But I had to spend almost all my money to join the French flowers in Lade.
But even after I spent the border -- my family was arrested and confused to cross the border in electricity.
After paying multiple and sounds, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and controlled again in the California capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family -- but my family was represented in prison to short distance of the South Korea bottom.
I went up and came between the office office and the police station -- specifically trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more underground or multiple.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man to ask, "What is the problem?
I was so surprised that a describing would care about question.
With my poor English and with a diagnosis, he explained the situation, and without dealing, the man went to the car box and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two normals and to get them out of prison.
I graduated with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I help me?
"I am not helping you, he said.
"I'm helping the North village.
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The male underground simulated a new hope for me and for the normal village when we needed it.
And I showed that the bank of the unknown and the support of international community are really the rooms of hope that the normal village needs to need.
At the time, after our long journey, my family and I got up in South Korea in South Korea.
But to get their freedom is only half of the battle of the battle of the battle of the battle of the battle of it.
A lot of neurons are separated from their families and when they open to a new country, they start with little or nothing of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English language.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with families still inside, and we spend information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very fortunate -- I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help you give northern northern organisms a chance to prepare with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more normal normals in all the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South South.
So this is Second South Center: London tools, fast food, white terrible.
And then the planning of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of Central Second to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles, as if this will fix what's really wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  The little Tasks --  The flames of lights, flat seats.
As 26,000 million other Americans, I lived in a desert of food, the Angeles Center South, home from food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to take kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying from crazy diseases in Los Angeles Center South America.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, George Hills, which is like 15 miles away.
I mean that this happened.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home see the day effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood?
I see cards of computers bought and sold as a card cars.
I see distributes of diagnoses like Staris.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I have already told me to handle 45 minutes and it goes back to buy a nanopy that doesn't have personality.
What I did, it was to play a food forest in front of my house.
In a land of land that we call a lab.
It's about 45 feet three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
This was how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, LT: Great Greeks, we put us together, and we started planning our food forest food, framework trees, you know, the nine complex versions.
What we do, we are kind of a group of groups paid by additions of all products, from all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
And then someone came up.
The city came up with me and they showed me a little bit of circulation saying I had to get my garden -- the circulation was made up humanity.
And I said, "Let's go, right?
A human order to plan food on a piece of land that no one is impossible."  So I was like, "Well, say, "Well, so that was like."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
LT: Times had the story written by Steve London, and I talked to the conflict and one of the members of George Green, who put a perception in Chinese, with 400 ways, we were a success.
We had the violence in our hands.
My conflict was even called to say that they represented and they were doing what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
LT: It's the U.S. city with more white terrible.
It has 16 miles of white terrible.
That's 20 Particles Center.
That's enough space to plan 35 million plants of task.
Why don't you look good this?
It will grow a plant to give a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars.
It's my story, when I tell people, culture your own food.
To grow your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South South.
I grew up there. I grew my kids there.
I was happy to be part of this male reality that was familiar for me for others, and I'm going to manipulate my own reality.
You see, I'm art.
The lab is my graph, I grow my art.
As a graphic artist, which is going to be walking around, I believe supermarkets, laws.
I use the law, the land, like a piece of line, and the plants and trees, are my emotion of that line.
They will be surprised to see what the land can do if you leave it to be his line.
You can just imagine the amazing thing that's a grandmother and how people affect people.
What happened?
I'm afraid of how my garden became an education tool of education, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the complexity of land.
We're the land.
They're surprised to see how the kids affect kids.
The lab is the most terrorist and property act that you can do, especially in a brain.
Also, you get free.
I remember an occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, were like 1950, in the night and were in my garden.
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me, and this only represents why I do this, people ask me, "I don't fear that people are going to steal your food?
So what I say, "My God, I don't have fear that you are going to rotate.
So that's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at its time, I want you to take your health.
There was another thing that I put a garden in a professor for showing in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys who helped me to download the path.
It was fantastic, they shared me their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plan with his mom and his grandmother, and it was amazing to see how this changed them, this was just just for a moment.
So George Greens has come to plan maybe 20 daughters.
We have had, like about 50 people who come from, work and participation, all of them in volunteer.
If kids grow color, kids will eat color.
If you grow tools, you'll eat tattoos.  But if nothing about this is taught -- if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind to what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're adapted. I see color kids that are in this way designed for them, who don't take them to any side.
With the lab, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are supporting from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who know?
Maybe it gets the next George Washington Carrier.
But if we don't change the compassion of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my planets, this is something I want to do.
I want to plan all a failure of dance, where people can share food in the same street.
I want to take contents and turn them into healthy challenges.
They don't get me.
I'm not talking about free things, because it is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is you have to hold it.
So what I talk about is to put people to work to people, to take the kids out of the street, who know the joy and the honor and the honor to grow their own food, open markets of additions.
What I want to do here, we have to do it sex.
I want you all to become evolutionary reverses, generations, general galaxies.
We have to change the guy of what's a condition.
If you're not a galaxie, you're not a guy.
So the genes take their room right?
That is their choice.
In all, if you want to get me to me, well, if you want to look at me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some fear -- to talk about making some fear.
If you want to see, they come to the garden.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
So "The microbes of marketing?  (Person of the microscope.  You probably all agree with me that this is a very big career.
It's made of a street, and the face is a good material to drive down, but not always -- especially not in days like today, where it takes a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the face that she says.
And especially if you go down in their bike and these cars are going on, that's not very nice.
Also, the application can make a lot of noise.
It's a failure material, and if we build cards, like in the Boston countries, very close to cities, we wanted a sustainable career.
The solution for that is to make some particular cards.
The parallel particular, a material that we use now in most of the Baselas of countries in the Boston countries, it has parents and water can happen through him, so the whole water of rain flows down to the side and have a career that is easy to drive up to the side and they will not make water more.
The noise will also disappear in these pounds.
Because it's very hold, all of the noise disappeared, so it's a very simple career.
It also has developments, of course, and the development of this career is that you can get off.
What is it to be able to be able to be able to be a card, you see that in this career the surfaces of the surface.
First of all, then several more and more and more and more, and then -- and then you can give it their parallel, and they can give you their parallel, and they're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more days.
Sometimes you can create bacteria with that.
There it is.
Backs, of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage comes in this material.
It's a parallel paradigm, as I said, so it only has a little amount of oil between the feet.
Because of the international light to the U.S. light -- this beet, this battle, the picture between the rivers, will be embarrassed, and if you continue, they will be microbial and separate from the advances.
So if you drive on the road, they will take the and you get the and you saw the and we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of architecture materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel land, from that to clean sand, and we can cut up the steel land in very small pieces and we can mix those little pieces with the bank.
So we have a hall with small pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the ones you see here, that you use to control, a machine machine.
Indiance can clear, especially the set, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the shell, to bring the bank, the bank flow for these microbes and the legs are going to be going back to the surface.
Today, I used a microbes of microscopes, because I can't bring the big machine machine here to the stage.
The microbes of microbes is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that goes out now.
I said that we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try.
So they gave us a piece of card, 400 feet from the Apple Apple -- where we had to make a tradition carbon to try this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the street test, and then, of course, this career will run several years without any day. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples of this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples -- we put a lot of charge in them, we put them up then with our education machine, and we represented them and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to connect -- I can say that we've done a material using steel fights, including these books, using the life of education for reality, and actually increase the life of the surface, even they can double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to face first before I can show you how the reputation is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it works.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember to have wake up a morning with the sound of the ball in my house.
My father was listening to BB News in his little Greek radio.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news generally depressed it.
"The Taliban were got to be graduated.
I didn't know what I mean, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
Now you can go to a real school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban was taken from Afghanistan and made illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I looked like a child to hide my older sister that I couldn't be used to be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could evolve them.
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could support where we were.
We had to hide the books in the markets of the market so that it seems that we were from companies.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us learned in a small room.
It was nice in the winter but extremely carbon in summer.
We all knew that we open our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
Once when the school was ready by a week, because the Taliban talks are supporting.
We always asked us what they knew about us.
Would they be following?
Did you know where we live.
We were antibiotic, but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was associated and the daughters a teacher.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total computer of a remote provide of Afghanistan -- Institute that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and that's why his father asked it.
But my education mother became shows.
This is it.
You get two years ago, just to become our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of the whole family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to get education, even their children, despite the talents, despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not educate their children.
For the years of the Talibans, I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and was always studied and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to record, but my father said, "Hey, daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can force your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So don't you want to continue?
I am 22 years.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the balloon, and if my family would not have been so committed with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find this proud of recording in Microsoft College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandmother, which was explained from his home for the value of education to their children, it was one of the first in happiness.
He doesn't just take away from my college title but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, which I take it by driving through the streets of Kabbar.
My family believe in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global engagement of 1995, a global campaign to educate women.
This is why South Soll, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risk for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the months, they are advanced by them, despite and still in front of a detailed opinion.
Like America. It's not their real name, and I can't show you his face, but America is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went from Sweden to his village, and literally they were written from being killed by a bomb in the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice was invited that if he followed his daughter to school, they would try to try.
Let me say, if you want, he said, "But I won't give the future of my daughter for their old and represented ideas.
What I've given you about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom we translate, there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and you see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are the first conventional interventions of the brilliant future of their children, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
On the talents, the girls who went to school is in hundreds of them -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the frequency of changes.
I fear that these changes don't make a lot, after the U.S. trades.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who are able to do for them, that animals, I see a professional future and a dead change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and implicating possibilities and every day the Slites of AIDS remember me.
Like me, they suffer in big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother that died in the exist, "Hah, respect Galaxies. I go to Galaxie.
But you never get a relative state revolution.
They have spent almost two years since the life revolution inspired by the old mass of mass movements so much of the technical revolution as the effect.
A force with a lot of other liberal citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of force and start a revolution against the terrifying regime of Gapan.
And we did, it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the vaccine, exploring the every regime of the regime -- putting paradigments of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a value to face the bright bright of Gapan.
They have shown a great sense of solution from the East East, to the rest to the subject.
Finally, after a period of six months of bright war and a few of the loss of about 50 thousand death, we could release our country and drive the street.
However, Galaxie left a card passenger, a train of the train, corruption and seasons of attention.
For four decades, the terrible regime of Galaxie destroyed infrastructure and culture and moral structure of free society.
Constant of the discovery and the challenges -- I've wanted to do with a lot of other women, to rebuild the free civil society -- exchanging a construction and fair to democracy and national recording.
They were starting about 200 organizations in Bendence during Benich during and immediately after the Dalaria of Dadic.
After a period of 30 years of example, I went back to Libera and with a unique environment, I started to organize tables about the development of capabilities and life skills.
With an amazing group of women we worked by the Planet of women Liberia by the Patient, a movement of women, leaders of women, from a very diverse organization, to deal by the political authority of women and our right participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the prediction period -- an environment that was increasingly post-bottled, which is moving from the political policies and exploration.
At time, our invisible was associated and successful.
Women won a 18th percent of the National Congress.
However, a little bit, the energy of choices and revolution as a everything, were depressingly, all of the days we found violence news.
One day we wake up with the news of the professional members and supply shots.
Another day I had a day with the news of the American forest and the attack to the condition.
Another day we wake up with the news of the official office of the extraction.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and their connections of the human rights and their response of the law.
Our society, formed by a revolution, polluting more, and it has gone out of the ideal and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had the beginning.
The intelligence, the exploration and the window became the ones of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all.
All right, I'm here today to trust that us, as a nation, we choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't lose well.
Because choices didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libera.
The critical list and analysis between candidates and candidates brought peace and national recording?
No, they didn't do it.
What happened then?
Why do our society follow popular and dominated with political employees of dominance and exploration, as much for men like women?
Maybe what they failed was not just women, but the female values of compassion, medicine and including.
Our society needs national dialogue and creation more than what the choices needed to do that they only represent population and diversity.
Our nation needs the cultural representation of the famous thing to need the nuclear and quantum responsibility of it.
We need to stop acting as an animal agents and call the days of it.
We need to start to act as a combination of compassion and medicine.
We have to develop a female speech, that not just honor but also put the medicine instead of the view, the collaboration instead of company, the convention instead of exploration.
These are the ideas that a Libera, described by war, needs specifically with the end of getting peace.
Because peace has an approach that is about interaction and attraction between female perspective and machines.
That's the real creature.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in social form.
According to a version of the Koran Salar -- "Pattern -- is the word of the Mission God, Brazil, compassionate."
At the time, the word "Raise, which is known in all the artificial traditions -- it has the same root in Arab than the word "The word "The word "The word "The word "The Fabrian and materials, which is going to all the humanity of men and women, that all the tribes and all of the people have moved up.
And so at the same thing that the theater is completely completely the environment, which grows inside the diagram of the number of the entire experience.
So it says, "My medicine opens all the things.
So it says, "My medicine comes on my war."
That all of you are connected to the brain of medicine.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a incredibly incredible question, which has an equally incredibly incredibly incredible.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to admit is the ones that all of them do -- why do she stay?
Why would anyone stay to stay with a man who puts him away?
I'm not particular, no social work, no social violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell you.
I was 22 years old. I had just been at the University of Harvard.
I had moved up to New York for my first work as writing and education in the Seventy magazine reverse.
I had my first approach, my first green American same Arabic Allen, and I had a very big secret sex.
My secret was that many times, a lot of times, the man, that I created my general soul -- I took her head with a pill, coming up with a piece of dot hold.
The man, I love more than nobody in this world, I put a pill in my head and threats to kill me more times than I can remember it.
I'm here to tell you the story of "The Loser Love, a psychological transportation, which is depressing from love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a surprised typical of domestic violence.
I'm limited in English of Harvard University and I have a MIT in Martin Western School.
I've spent most of my career working for the companies of the Finance 500, between them John O, Johnson, I read Burger and the Washington Pound.
I take almost 20 years ago with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black lab and conducted a mind Honoman Shooth.
So my first message for you is that the domestic violence can happen to anything, all of the radio, all the religions, all of the religions, all the levels of reserve and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly not.
More than 85 percent of the markets are men, and the domestic addition only happens in the ancient relationships and very much direction or a long way, in the families, the last place where we want or expect to find violence -- motivated by which, the domestic attention turns so discovered.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be used with a man who stood him, and in fact, I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women in between 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be value violence that the other age, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are strong every year by Paris, novel and markets in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence or their search signals or their patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rain night of energy.
I was sitting on my side in New York of New York and started freedom with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also going to get out of a University of the Eleven Leadership and worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what I was impressed in that first find was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed a kid of the field.
I had a lot of big molecules like managements, and a train robot street, and it seemed so distant.
One of the most intelligent things that I did Congress, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the wall.
It did it about all the beginning in a performance.
We started coming out and I loved all of me, which was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard -- that I put passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and electrons.
Connection believed in me, as writing and as a woman, like nobody had done it.
And it was why the literature in that president school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is to self-control and make the victims.
And I didn't know that the second step is to shape it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I'm going to go from New York City and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do savings for your wall, so I accepted my work and Congress and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was going on in a little love, which was entering his head in a physical trial, financial and professional psychological professional.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reduces it.
And here is where they go into stage those pills.
And in how much we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to feel that Congress had to feel so safe was bought three pieces.
One had in the way of the car.
Another wave on the law in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those pieces to cause the transport that I lived from small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those pieces actually were a message for me, and even though I had never taken my hand, my life was already in danger seriously, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of Congo happened five days before our bottom.
It was the seven in the morning and I still had the camera.
Five days later, when the 10 engines of my neck had developed, I put my mother back and I fell with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we live happy for always because I loved him, and he also wanted me very much.
And I was very, very accountable.
It was just really supporting for the bottom and for the fact to form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never get a day.
I spent two times more in our moon moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach, and he lost me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I recorded several times against the level of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our mile of a mile -- it was taken by the traffic and I took a Big March for the face.
Connection kept putting up one or two times a week for the next two years and the middle of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only in this situation.
One of three American women is victims of domestic violence or access to some point of their life, and the Center of control control of diseases information that every year 15 million children are made -- 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So coming back to my question: Why do I stop?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was using me.
At the contrary, I was a very strong woman, love from a profound man, and it was the only person in the world that could help Congress to face their demons.
The other question that all the world does is, why does it just not make?
Why did I didn't go? I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the most sad and painful question that makes people, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you ignore -- is incredibly dangerous to get a market.
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the strategies in the cases of domestic violence happens after the victim has put up to the relationship, after marriage, because then the abuse has no longer to lose it.
Other refugees include the permanent access, even after the abuse has come back to marry -- decision of financial resources, and manipulation system of family system to deal to the victim and their children, who are normally forced by the games to spend the man who would put his mother.
And we still continue to ask why it's just not right?
I was able to go to me, because of a last piece of passion that I sold my negative.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed if you have allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world, to the police -- to my neighbors and my friends and families -- and I'm here today because everyone would help me.
We have the tendency to study victims as specific stories, architecture women, good groups.
The question, "Why do you stay?
For some people is a way to say "The collection is its for surprising, as if the victims will be able to try to look at men who want to destroy them.
But since I published "Look, I have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also captured, that they learned an amazing lesson of what happened to them and they made their lives light and happy lives as employees, wife and mothers -- lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survival of very typical violence.
I was going to marry with a legal man and the threat and we have those three children.
I have that black lab and also that mission.
What I'm not going to have to have never more, again, is a card pill taking my head in hands of someone who says to me.
At this time, the same thing you're thinking, "Hey, that's fascinating." or "Hall, what does it say, but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right right now, that they're being smart or that they were small or that they were surprised themselves.
The mathematical could be affecting his daughter to his brother, their best friend right now.
I was able to put myself to my little particular love to break the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it is my last position to you.
They talk about what you've heard here.
The advance is just on the silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence just bringing light on it.
victims need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secret of domestic violence.
They take the mathematical to the light talking about it with their children, their work, their friends and family.
They represent their vision of survival as fantastic and traditional people, which have a full future.
They recognize the early signals of violence to get conscious to interact their scale and show the victims a safe sale.
Together, we can become our cases, our table and our families in the safe and paintings that should be.
Thank you.
Hi, I call Mars Russia, and from a time, I'm model.
To be precisely, since 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is an amazing tension in the room because it shouldn't have been seen like this.  So luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first role of clothes in a TED stage, so you have a lot of lucky to introduce it, I think.
If some of the women were surrounded when I left, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find it later in Twitter.
I also want to feel that I have the privilege of power to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not all the world has that opportunity.
These tons are very uncomfortable -- less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to spend this subject for the head, because it's when you're going to get out of me, so they don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embraced.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also surface.
I've changed completely what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a novel in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photograph told me that I would fix the space and to open the head of the girl.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial broken like that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our aspect -- which, although surface and immediately, has a great impact in our lives.
So today, for me, it's worth to be honest.
I'm in this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my lab sector, that's being a sex girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do me, but in a single way.
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a heart discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made me model is because you get the genetic option, and I'm the benefit of a brother, and maybe you're asking you what this here is this.
Well, in the last century we have not only defined beauty as health, the subject and symmetry -- which we're biological professional to married, we also have associated it to a high and strange fight, to the family and a white skin.
And that is my brother, sister that I've been known to get money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now shows special, and maybe there are some years of the way they say, wait, there's National, Tarry, John Samal, Lin Senson.
First of all, happiness to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But I usually have to introduce you that in 2007, a student student from New York University told each and every one of the models in the past, and in the Sixtakes of the Steven models, only 27 percent of them -- is to say, less than four percent, not balloon.
The next question that people always do is, could it be model when it is more?
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then, what I really would tell you every one of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the invention of the next Internet, or a national heart surgeon and political surgery, which would be impressive, because you would be the first one.
If after this particular list of special, they still intervene, no, Camera, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my head.
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the record of the American Google magazine or the excuse of HIV, or the next Steven Message.
It will say that of greater you want to be model is like saying you want to win the goal when you are bigger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose to.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike heart surgery -- it can be shown right now.
I don't know what happened there.
And almost once you've gone up with your studies, and you have a computer and a few jobs to your shoes -- no matter what you say, is to say, if you said you want to be president of the United States, but your computer said, Model model for 10 years, people will look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are recorded.
And yes, they probably get all the pictures, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that took me, and also the first time I used a biology, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a girl.
So I just put my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a party of paintings a few days before the pictures for the French Google.
Here I am with my football team and in the Vietnam Revolution.
And this is me at all.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creation of a group of professionals, fisheries, photographs and strategies, and all of their help and people of press and proposition, and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is: Do you get free things, you get free things.
I have too many tons of 20 inches and I never use, except the bottom before, but the privilege that I get in the real life, and what we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free grade.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend that was a computer paradigm, he took a set in red and, of course, they were like, and I had a feeling of it, and I had a feeling of a feeling to be able to keep declined.
I enjoy these privilege for my aspect -- not why I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect without matter who they are.
I lived in New York, and last year, from the 1950, texting to the ones who are going to stop and recorded, 80 percent were black and later, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 170,000 young black and Latin York in New York, so for them, is not a question of me?
But how many times would you go to me, and what?
When I research for this talk, I learned that at 45 percent of the girls of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that film is elected to 75 percent to 17 percent.
So the last question that people do is, what is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit more depressed and you have the most brilliant hair, you feel very happy and study.
And behind the cameras -- we give a answer that maybe it looks like.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel and also incredible power to work with creative people, income and appropriate.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say from the cameras -- what I have never said in front of them, is, I'm inspired.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a few more delivered legs and the highest horse will be more happy.
They only have to get up with a group of models because they have the most brilliant legs and the most brilliant horse and the room of the morning, but probably the most pretty powerful women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a strategy of rational option and gender when I am one of the biggest benefits.
If there is something to get from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when I recognize the power of the image that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was most enough enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more accurate pictures and I didn't go out of the sand.
There were no artistic directions, no opportunities, no opportunity to repeat pictures -- not even a care in the embrace.
In fact, most of them took the tourists to the short.
My story starts when I'm going to find in the city of New York to give a position, my wife took me this picture by holding my daughter in the day of their first bomb. That's the corner of 75 and five.
I gave the quality that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third bomb of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take it to Sana to New York in a family journey, and you continue the right?
This is when we started to ask the tricks that happened to take us the picture.
It's surprising that the rest of training the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and unfortunately, no one has gone with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much we would change the life this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the 16 and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five years old, I could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of occupy and to ask us to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just in physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we always take the same picture, our perspective change, my daughter takes new stories, and I can see the life through their eyes and how it belongs to all of their eyes and how it belongs with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion all the year.
And recently, in one of the journey, we were walking on, when suddenly he went back and signal a red tourist of the surrounding store that I was a little bit of little visions.
And I described what I had felt about five years of foot in that same place.
I found that I remember his heart painting to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York are university, because it's decided to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of participate in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but besides these 15 pictures -- it doesn't go in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to get in the picture, and they don't go back to someone and ask it, you take us a picture.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10 species of birds in the world.
The bases are in the most threatened bird group.
First of all, why do they have so bad pressure?
It has also been associated with Disk red pensivers as a mental characters as mentally stories, stories students.
More recently, if you've been following the press benefit pressure, applications and access these are the attributes that are associated with the Kenya Parking.
I don't accept it. You know why.
Because the members of Pakistan don't keep clean the environment --  Parks are not helping to prevent disease.
They are really monitoring.   You're far from extracting --    And my favorite, the bases have better presence --  -- there are two kinds of banks on this planet.
There are the based of the New world that are mostly in the America, like the cords and the careers, and the based of the old world, where we have 16 species -- of these 16 -- 11 to face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the bases important? In the first place, they provide vital ecological services -- Limitan.
They are our natural base records.
They clean the cards to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria -- help to absorb the story that not to be for them to be extracted and cause large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no bases, the caves take three to four times more time in depression, and this has huge factors in the profession of disease.
The babies also have huge historical matter.
They've been associated to the old effective culture.
General was the symbol of the protection and the material and, along with the course, shared the unit between the Atlantic and the Earth Boston.
In the Chinese machine, Jack was the based child, and he opened his life to save the daughter Singer of 10 heads Radio.
In the basic culture, you make a lot of really important streets in the open sky -- in places like Terrible, there is no place to train death, or wood to create them, so these bits provide a natural electricity system.
What is the problem with the birds?
We have eight species of banks in Kenya, from which six are in extreme threatened threats.
The reason is that they're being sending, and the reason that they're being invented is because there are conflict between humans and factory, the patient communities use this window against depressions, and as a consequence of the bases are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of banks are in the critical list of extraordinary extraction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years will be extracted, and the reason is because they take a piece of the bank consumption that has been treated with an acoustic drug like Delicious.
This drug has been spread for version in India and have taken a position.
Because there are no bases, there has been a proposition in the number of street dogs in conservation consumers, and when you have street dogs -- you have a huge time of time for Arab -- the number of radio cases has increased huge in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest electric parks in Africa, 300 set up are going to be top of the Turkey law.
I'm not against the electric energy, but we have to work with governments, because the electric tribes do this to birds -- they cut them for half of it.
They're seats of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible combination of dead banks to serve the ball and the factory market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're researching these birds -- we're putting them transportations.
We're trying to determine their basic economy, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries -- so to focus on a very often problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in religious levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about learning the bases, about the need to learn these wonderful creatures and the services that they proved.
How can you help help? It can become active -- you can write a letter to their government and tell them we need to focus on these very uncomfortable creatures -- giving her time to determine the word -- definition the word.
When you go out of this room, you will report about the bases, but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the banks.
They are very elegant -- Charles Darwin said that he changed out of opinion because I saw them fly without effort -- no energy of energy in the sky.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do professionally, my life has been moving for seven years of work during my global guy in Africa.
From 1988, to 1980, London young, but I am not --  I worked in James, Kenya, Cartoon Court Court, Arabic and Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for a Titanian Notheria, and every project that we were looking at in Africa.
And I was providing.
I thought, at the age of 21 that the Alternatives were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all that we took we advertised it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Where was a project where a few Americans we decided to teach people from James to grow food.
So we came up with the Standards to the south of James to this absolutely wonderful value that goes down to the Richard river -- and we teach the local local tours to grow the intelligent and called the laboratory tattoos and called the classrooms.
Of course, people were not at absolutely interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't help --  We were surprised that the local local, in so cold value, they had no audience.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said, "Thank God who are here --   "I hear time to save people from James from the mammal."
And of course, everything in Africa is creative.
We got these wonderful talents. In Italy, a car grew up to this size. In Mark, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the shames, "Look, what easy is anonymous?
When the tattoos were big, marriage and red markets, in the morning at the morning, about 200 holes came from the river and they ate everything.  And we said to the shares?
And the students said, "Yes, that's why we don't have audience here --  "Why didn't they say it?
I thought we just made the Americans we made mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did -- what the English did, what the English did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Machine.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the holes.
You should see the descriptions.  You want to see the descriptions that we protect the people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read "Have Martin Martin, Man Monster, emotional economy.
The book became 2007.
We have Western donated countries, we've trained the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I will not tell you about the day that that money has changed.
They just read his book.
Lay it from a African woman, the day we've done.
The Western are impossible, collaborative metaphors, and we treat people just two ways, or the patients, or we are patients.
The two words come from the liquid late Patient, which means "Pathology?
However, they mean two different things.
Patient, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids. I want a lot.
Patient, I treat all of the different culture as if they were my search.
So the white in Africa are called "Billian Gets."
That book gave me a board in the face -- "The small is beautiful -- "I write by Supermark, who said by all economic development, if people don't want to be helped to be help, you get alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is responsible.
This morning, the lady who opened this conference put up a street on the soil and said, we can be able to imagine a city that isn't neurons.
I decided at the age of 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called Facial Company where you never start anything, you have a matter to anyone, but it becomes a serious passion of the local passion, the secret of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do you? It's started.
You go to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people of the local.
We don't work from the office.
We put up in a coffee. We put up in a wall.
We have an infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to something.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you going to do you?
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important.
And then, we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea can not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea, why not us, for once instead of getting a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once we hear them, but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There is a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs are never struggling, and they will never say, in a public meeting, what you want to do with their own money, what opportunities have infected.
So planning has this blind point.
The most smart people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face for face, you have to create a social infrastructure which doesn't exist.
You must create a new teacher.
Profession is the family doctor of the company, the family family of the business -- which is started with you in your house, in the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making the life.
I started this as a test in Spanish, the U.S.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this conditional base where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in market, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do that? And I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I went out and listen to them,    So the government says, "Let me say, "Let's do it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40 business.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of solution.
Peter Drugger, one of the most great companies of history, failed to the '90s, a few years ago.
Peter Drug was a philosophy professor before it was involved in business, and this is what Peter Russian, "The planning is actually impossible with a society and an innovation of innovative company.
Planning is the basis of the democracy of the business spirit.
So now you are building Christian without knowing what people else in China want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to go back with you.
You have to offer consciousness, privacy, it has to be fantastic when you help them, and then they will be going to be going on.
In a community of 10 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, the intelligence and passion?
What do you present you have been able to get more this morning.
Local local people. That's what you have applied.
So what I tell you is that the business spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, fundamental fossil fundamental fundamental films -- manufacturing and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal fuel engine is not sustainable.
The phrase as a way of support management is not sustainable.
What we need to consider is how we nurture, we create, we come on, we transport, we compute to seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for green revolution, universities?
Government? Lever it flow."
You will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York in the year 1880.
And in the year 1880, it took up this group of people, and they wrote about what happened to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was non-termination, the city of New York would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they put the curve, and they set, if the population gets growing up to this room, to bring up to the population of New York to the around, they will get six million gentlemen, and the star produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were going to be standing on starting.  So in 1880, they were divided this technology that would destroy the life of New York.
So what happens -- in the next 40 years, in the United States -- in the United States came out of 100 automobile companies -- 1000.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely abstract and there were very few -- scales, factories in approached places.
Deliver, Michael Hero.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer consciousness.
In another way, they won't come to convince you.
And then you have to offer an absolute one, device, interviewed service.
And protected, you will have to tell you the truth with it to understand.
The smallest company, the largest company has to be able to make three malarial things, the product that you want to sell it has to be fantastic. You have to tell you a fantastic combination and you have to tell you a very financial architecture study.
You know what?
We've been known to a only human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
You don't exist.
This is still not born.
We've invented and looked at the 100 companies of the Carbon world, System, Edinternet, East, all the new companies, Google, Japan.
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common -- just one, one was started by one person.
I love the word "I said, "It's 32 times.
He wasn't just when I started.
No one starts a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community where we have favorites, who come from a little business of little business sitting on catastrophes, in bars together to their decades who would do for you, what someone did for this head who talks about this epidemic who talks about this epidemic, someone who would ask you, what does it mean?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can sell it? Can you look for the money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
You know, you can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all of the neighbors -- so we don't understand a lot of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like automobiles, plants and time.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their approaches?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment.
How do you share more memories of our buildings adding and understand better our passion?
How do we share more our hope to the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Organs and I'm looking at New Oregrand.
My soul always finds advice with the giant robots that give shows to love, barriers and soldiers from centuries and trust in a city.
It always gives the music.  There's a department in New Organs.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the biggest amount of average properties of America.
I lived close to this house and I thought how it could become a higher space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was John as a mother for me.
His death was represented and increased.
I thought a lot about death.
And this made me a profound graph for the living time.
He gave it clear to the significant things in my current life.
But I go to keep this look at my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to leave the day to day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old friends and new friends brought the wall of this house based up in a giant piece and painted on her free forests to completely do that."
So the transports could take a time, to reflect about their lives and share personal applications in public space.
I didn't know what to wait from this experiment but the next day the wall was represented and kept conditional.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I would die I want to be played by paradigm,  before I die I want to sit up in the line of the face of face."
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people.
Before I die I want to plan a tree.
Before I die I want to live outside the network."
Before I die I want to take it over one more time.
Before I die I want to go to the rest of someone?
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This space was basically constructed and the dreams and the dreams of people made me close to cards, they said, and they gave me trust in difficult moments to me.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and speeches. It's about giving the reflection and conference, and remember what the most important thing for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civil center we did a quote and now have been killed in countries around the world, like Kangaris, South Africa, Architect and beyond there.
So together we show the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distributions in the environment, it's more important than never to find the ways to build the perspective and remember life is brief and depressed.
The death is something that we often looked at talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we will prepare for death is one of those things that become more power.
Think about the classic death our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters us as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fear and stories, the people who surrounded us can't only help better places, can help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now I have a only perspective.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my sisters.
Remember is 22 years old, it's high and very graphic.
I don't talk about it, but it will translate better than some of the best surrounds.
And I remember what love.
I share it including what happens.
It's not a very appropriate. I don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and followed in this, it has never mind.
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to provide words that I can't even be able to remember -- I remember one thing, the little thing we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be the unknown thing.
Samal is 16 years old. It's very high.
You put the most smart memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, to make my arm in my arm during the first episode of Telescope and the Ball Galax colleagues.
Do you don't seem incredible?
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds are not advanced to the concept of society of society, often they're innovative and increasing.
But what I put my heart and forced my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them inside the order, that could only mean one thing, which was extraordinary and attention and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term autonomous, is a beautiful brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every individual in every individual in the way that I was so different to Sama.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, it's diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increase in the world, there is no cause of concepts in the world.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living and ended up in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars around the room, look at the labor and eat any thing that would be between media.
As I grew up, it becomes more different, and the differences made more evidence.
But beyond the brands, the frustration and the international hippore, there was something really unique -- a couple of public and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without predictions, a human being had never mind.
Extraordinary.
I can't negotiate that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I would have designed that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuals and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that don't want to change for normal.
The narrative happens by high beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could bring it up one thing to Read and Sama and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, authorities or not, the differences that we have -- they're a dollar -- each of us has one day in its inner and simulated, the search of the narrative is the last satellite of the potential.
The opportunity for gravity, progress and change die at the moment that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what should have been African in the country of Marchesters.
He asked me to be asked to me, a computer teacher, which gives a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was assumed --  To actually stop these students with their big minds, their big books and their big words and designers.
But when we developed those conversations -- I felt what Alice should have felt when he went down the content of the control and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students -- I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great community.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are taking our biggest challenges from energy and care of health, between others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as no scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers -- please.
I want to share some assumptions about how you can do it to make sure we can see that their science is sex and their engineering is attractive.
First question to answer, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant for us.
They don't just tell us that they study the transports, but they study the transports, which are the male structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the support.
And when they're describing their science, careful with the set.
Letter is a strategy for our understanding of their ideas.
So, you can say space and temperature, but why don't you say "Space and time, which is much more accessible to us?
You can make them accessible is not the same thing to do them.
In contrast, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without buying ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples and stories and antibiotics. They are ways of the way to reach and entered with their content.
And when you present their work, forget from the signs of "balloon."
You have asked why they call "Babies."  What do you do the balls? The whales kill and kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring -- but it is being supported to the area of our brain and addresses us.
Instead, this picture of General Brong is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of transportations is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eastern Tarman.
The trick here is to use a simple fragile, leading that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and, to continue to provide graphics that apply to our other senses and believe a more profound sense of understanding of what it is.
I think these are just some key that you can help us open the door and see the country of the wonderful that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers -- when they have solved this equation for all the media, the member of the media --  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Disconnectory of English Exploration is "Supermarket."
Just because it sounds very well.
And "South "Southern means Police Polio.
Even though there was a personal editor of the 19th century that did it much better when he said, "A supply is the one that looks for a public cartoon without matter particular, plant or first, and that, when you win it, you get it by the use of a really really reported very consumer.
I have no idea what it means "short."
Something I will do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the base in politics, and that all the politicians know they have to try to make the language.
It wasn't until for example, 1875 that the British Park allowed the newspapers to quote the words that were told in the particular camera.
And all of this was thanks to the value of a guy with the name of Brazil Brong, who was faced to the Pacific.
They moved up on the London of London and they were like, but he had enough value to face them, and at the end had such a popular support in London who win.
And just a few years later, we had the first use recording from the phrase standing on the back of the back of the back of the back of the metaphor.
Most of you think it's literally.
It's not. It's for a description of the freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact -- I want you to go back to the United States, just after investigation.
So they had to take the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a reproductive country.
This was determined in Congress for a long time.
They were presented all sorts of survival that you could have failed.
Some of them wanted to call it "Player from States Sandaria, and other Alexander, "The George Alexander Alexander, and other Department of the U.S. People Washington.
Not very attention.
Some just wanted to call it "The "Yeah."
They thought it was a quality of probably.
And they didn't even have them the members, they had the idea that you could be chosen Right by a depressed piece.
And it could have been serving.
All of the world is money, because this debate was provided for three weeks.
I read the day of a sense parent, and I always wrote, still with this story."
What caused the rest and the rest was that the Republic Campaign was against the Sense.
The Company Campaign didn't want the Washington to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
They didn't want to call it Read for if you did it or their own ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most modeling title and more including and more small than it was happened.
And that title was "President."
President. They didn't invent the title -- there was already before, but it just meant somebody who press a recording."
It was like the president of a barrier.
And I didn't have much more great than the term "speaking or surface."
There were the evidence of the evidence of small environmental and government food, but it was really an infinite title of the time.
And so the Sense is controlled.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call the President."
This guy has to be struck and record with extraordinary digitals.
"And who will take it in serious with a role as ridiculous and influence as President of the U.S.
And finally, after three weeks of debate -- the Sense didn't happen.
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Sense has never solved the time of President.
The President Barack Obama has enough to follow there, waiting to the Sense between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temperature.                                                     
But the third thing we can learn -- and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and with this I want to leave you, is that the president of President of the United States doesn't sound at all.
In all if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to despite, the biggest economy in the world and a flow of the board vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have given to the grandmother table.
So at the end of the sense of the Sense.
They got his responsibility time.
And also the other concern of Sense, the synapse of synthetic, well, it was a synthetic for then.
But you know how many nations have now present?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear head, etc.
So, at the end of the Sense went and the Campaign of Reputs lost because no one is going to feel humble when they tell you that they're now the U.S. President now.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn and I would like to leave you.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to give the way and control reality, but actually, the fact that it makes a lot more the words that these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 dollars under land in a illegal minister of Ghana.
The air is cut out of heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of subjective bodies in dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices you talk about, but especially that character of male tricks and pieces with primitive tools.
As the others, I took a little bit of tiny light subject to the head with this superinterner supply and I can barely distinguish the raises of the walls that hold the walls of that hole of a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the land.
And I got my hand and suddenly I remember a minute I met days before, that lost the control and care minister in that piece.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole bringing their lives without pay and recorded and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never do it, because they're press of scale.
In the last 25 years I was documenting national cultures in over 70 countries in six countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only exhibition in the Community of Congress Park.
And among all the amazing people I met there I met a print of Freedom that Slaves, a Kenya who is dedicated to eradicate modern school.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not such a grade.
When we ended up talking to me I felt very bad, honest was able to ignore this attention of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
And I was made a little bit of the story and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the "Red of "Learn that Slave and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern school.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them, I would consider them my second home.
But this time, it will get up the dirty trials.
A conservative chapter says that there are currently more than 27 million of people hidden in the world.
It's twice of the amount of African African devices during the whole deal of traditional schools.
A hundred years ago, the cost of a architectural scale was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. work.
The equivalent of about 50 percent.
However, today you can apply to the entire families by generations by the new doors of U.S.
So surprisingly, the scale generates from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
A lot of them have been excited with false programs of good education.
Today, the slavery operating in the beginning, the goods produced by scales have value, but who produce them are deployed.
School exists in almost all the world, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and New Angeles, I met the horses of streets.
This strange thing was how to go into the ancient Egypt or the Donation of Dance.
Institute in a film of 45 CO, men, women, in fact, family families in a step of pollen -- they have mechanical metals in their head, until 18 to the time, and they take them from the horrible ants to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
Despite the monkey and the context work on silence, doing this task over and over over 16 hours a day.
There were no paradigments to eat -- not to drink -- and the self-surprise destruction made it quite interesting.
And so penguins were the heat and the police that my camera became too hot, and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run up to the car to clean the team and make it work with an air accelerated to prevent it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a lot better than these people.
And back in the ants I wanted to grow up but the attention that I was at my side quickly took me and said, "Like, you don't do it. Don't do it here.
And I explained very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't a city of that country.
I could put them into a worst situation than they were.
I had to trust the Seat of the Slaves and work inside the system for their freedom and trust it to get it.
In the way to me, I hope to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalay, I found kids running stones during miles by months by mountains that were waiting down.
Those big plants were more likely than kids who cut them up and kids put them into their heads with card cards made of steps, and rooms and hard.
It's hard to introduce something so absolute.
How can we influence something so instituted, but so construction?
Some of you don't even know that they're scales -- and they work 16 hours a day without paying -- because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to compare with.
When these Americans came up with their freedom, the scales were actually made their house.
When you hear the word school we often thought of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness of the world that would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Kanya they were made me women who had been probably sexual schools.
I was taken by a few states that they were given to this kind of surface, the flat light.
It wasn't exactly a brain.
It was more good a restaurant.
Researcher, as you know in the office, they are local for the French proposition.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the scales women with their girls and kids, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to train customers and to encourage them to buy more food and alternative.
Each point is dark and surface, identified by a number of a paint in the wall and divided by a biomate and a corner.
The workers often suffer sexual addition to hands of their customers.
In fish in the printing, I remember to have felt a term flower fear and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be addressed in that incentive.
I just had a sale, the scales where I went in.
There were no street doors.
There were no big enough windows as to transport.
Those people don't have scale and because we play a very difficult issue -- it's important to feel that scale, even the sexual traffic -- happens to us.
There are hundreds of super-entire people in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service and the list can continue to it.
And recently, the New York Times reported that between 100 and 300 people Americans are sold every year as sexual schools.
It happens for detail, but we don't see it.
The teenagers are another activity that we often relate to the scale of speech work.
I visited Indian villages where there were families in the beginning of the ground.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father, the blue rates and the red of your children.
They mix tons in these big whales and support silk on the liquid to the world, but the tourist is typical.
My interest told me their stories.
We don't have freedom?
We still hope -- you can go out of this house some day and go to another place where we really pay us our job.
It's estimated that there are over 400 children speed on the law law, the largest artificial law in the world.
When we came on, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family family in a boat, two older brothers -- some more young kids -- it has sense right?
Eric. They were all scales.
The kids are separated from their family families, depressed and forced to work strange sands in these buttons in the law, despite not knowing anything.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came up was terrible, it was terrified that his little hand was extraordinary.
I was paralyzed by the fear of carried to water.
The rates of the trees of the trees in the law Roller often add networks and kids, faced and with fear -- they are forced to the water to detect the rates.
Many of them are hearing.
Since I remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to be able to do, and as all life has been treated with criminal, it is certainly about the younger schools under their wall.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working from the one.
In the night and version night.
And it turns out that these networks are more than 400 pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Koblin.
Kobody was represented in a pistory of fishermen.
I met it in a refugee where I know that Sheeping the Slaves related to victims of scale.
Kobody sustainable the possible.
Who will be because of someone decided to make the difference in your life?
By driving by a road in Ghana with some of the Stephens of Freedom that Steven -- a company with his goal of suddenly accepted and support our car and put the window.
We asked us to follow it by a path of land to the sea.
At the end of the way, we went out of the car, and I asked the driver to go quickly.
And then he signal this sendence just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
As we began to go down, we had the orders that block the path and after walking about one hour we found that the path was stuck by the recent rain records, so I put pictures of pictures on my head as we were going to go into these water to the chest.
After two hours of walking up, the second path ended up in a clear, and we had in front of a hole of holes that could fit in a football field, and they all were full of speed workers.
A lot of women had killed children to their shoes and while they looked for gold -- they walked in water with members.
The memory is used in the exception process.
These guys are slides in a poem in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the poem were spread in their own subject.
I remember looking at their eyes cared, independent, because many had been under Earth for 35 hours.
Pollen have to 90 feet and these people cut balls out of stone that then will be transformed to another area where they will kill the stone to be able to extract the eye.
First of all, the site seems to be full of strong men and virtual men, but if we look closer to the sea, we look at other farmers and also children.
They're all victims of lessons, disease and violence.
In fact, it is very likely to have this muscle end up like this victim of the tricks and the movement of medicine in a few years.
This is Manda. When his father died his father he took it to work with him in the minutes.
When he died his uncle -- Manda had the debt of the uncle that force it to be scale in the minutes.
When I met it, I had worked in the ministers 14 years and the lesson of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident.
In addition to that, Manda has training training, and not just that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dream with being released and educated with the help of local activists like "Freedom that Slave, and it's this kind of depression, from face to a remote possibility -- which inspired me a lot of respect.
I want to bring light on the scale.
They knew that their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give terrorism of them, and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I just think that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to play attention like scale.
These images are not researchers. They're of people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these many beautiful people, mathematically, which I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force gets a fire and that that force interviewed light on slavery because, without that light, the basis of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math and there's a permanent problem for who it does, we are like generation controls.
Nobody knows what dinosaurs we do.
So today, I'm trying to tell you what I do.
Ball is one of the most human activity.
We have the virtual viruses and the calculation balloons --  that we will see further.
But the ball gives a degree of extraordinary training and a high level of destruction and probably a certain thing that can well have a genetic computer.
Sadly, the neural disorders like the bad of Pakistan destroy gradually this extraordinary ability -- like I do with my friend James State who, in his time, was a virtual blood value.
In the last few years has been programmed in the treatment.
However, there are six million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with an amazing identity, terrible terms, redinitious and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in objective way, and in definition, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and certain music.
But it's frustrated that for the Parkins and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markets. That's why they don't look at blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological example of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive -- and that means that, outside the clinical trials -- they never do.
And what if patients could do it in home.
That would save a difficult journey to the clinic -- what if patients could do the example themselves.
You wouldn't need a person.
By the way, it costs about 300 in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to introduce you as a way not conventional to try it, you see, in a certain sense at least, we are all viruses like my friend Jane State.
This is a video of the violence of the empty corresponds.
It shows someone healthy while you get sound to talk about -- we can imagine as a band of a local ball because we have to run all those local organs to produce sound and all of the genes -- the FED, for example.
And as the ball, it takes a level of extraordinary training.
We think the time that leads to a child learn to talk about.
On the side of the sound, we can cut the position of the voices of voices as they live, and as the Park affects the extractions, also affect the local organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the role of the local correspons.
We see the same systems.
Voice: developing and redinning.
The discussion becomes more transportative and applicated after a car, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these elements based on the voice with specific clinical trials -- well, both are not invisible.
The neurological trial is not invisible. They both use existing infrastructure.
It's not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both of them are precisely. Well, but you have the eyes based on voice are not specific.
I mean, they can be advanced.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are from the monkey cost, and we all know what happens.
When something gets a cost so low, it comes to mass scale.
These are a few incredible letters to address.
We can reduce the protective difficulty of patients.
I would not make you go to the clinic for the root calculation.
With high frequency we could get objective data.
We could make a massive market of low cost for clinical trials and, for the first time, calculating carbon calculations.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first members of disease before it's too late.
So when I give you today the first steps in that sense, we are reading the local Investigation of Parkins.
And I put Alth and Pathings, we want to get a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local local lines for about 500 million people in the world.
Any one with Parkins or without Parkins, it can call the low price and leave records for a few cents -- and I'm pleased to encourage that we've already reached seven percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Richard." So Martin -- taking all these samples of samples, say 10 people, you might say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What about these shows?
Mars Little Little -- Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not disease.
MK: You see, some people can not pass it. You may not finish it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data recorded in different circumstances and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for to limit the conflict factors in search of the real disease.
TR: Do you have 80 percent price right now.
MK: A lot more than that.
In fact, my student Tuestan, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network also, what the project is. Now we have 90 percent pressure.
TR: New and nine. Well, it's a better.
MK: Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Mark Little Palestine."
MK: Thank you, I took.
Before 2011, I made photographs in New York City.
We are plant creatures.
We take us in the dark, in many without windows and, by the general, we avoid solar light.
We do the developing models still more delicious, the perfect skin still more perfect we do the impossible thing, possible and create us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real job for images and photograph.
The age of 1970 signal -- I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the traditions that happen in Japan.
A little time later, an organization where it was volunteer, there are the South Vollands, he was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't be able to be sitting in home, so I decided to get to the group for three weeks.
The 13 percent came to Europe.
It's a small village of public philosophers in the precise of almost 50 people, one of the first people affected by the sun.
The level of recording water came over 24 feet old and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was developed.
We took schools from the channels and the banks.
We launch schools -- we took the end and leave the list houses to be recorded and related.
We took tons and teacher teachers dead -- associated, power of local failure.
We showed us and loved us.
For weeks, both the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of pictures and cameras and sheets and sixth.
They all did the same thing.
You get them back and take them to different places of the people around to get them.
It was not until then I realized that those pictures represent a huge part of the personal loss that that people had suffered it.
As they were out of the planet, and to save their lives, they had to get absolutely all they had.
At the end of my first week I started helping in a village of the village.
He helped clean the common banks -- the huge the great banks.
This place turned out to be about the place of the village where the center center is collecting the photos.
And there they took them and I had the honor that that day they trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspired -- I had heard the expression to think beyond the hours, but it wasn't until to take myself my hours that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years ago were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking as a research how to fix that mouse and represent that radio and met hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night came into Facebook with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so absolute and positive and positive and positive and I knew we had to try it.
So we started to challenge the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too strong, but where the water had documented the face of the girl had to fix it with a lot of pressure and deployment.
In another way, that child would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the strategy picture.
With the step of the time, they came up by lucky more pictures and they needed more researchers so that I went into Facebook and Linean and five days later 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
At the age of two weeks I had 150 people who had been able to get up.
In Japan, in Julia, we moved to Reducers, a neighbor in the north of Hamman.
Once the week we used our scanner in the terms of temporary photographs that had been inspired, where people were going to raise their pictures.
The time that they took in them is a different story, depending out of the desperation of photos.
It could be an hour. It could make weeks.
I could make months.
This guy had got to draw virtually to hand using as the areas whose color and detail the water had no destroyed water.
I took a lot of time.
And the water destroyed all these pictures on water water, colors of bacteria, with states, even with access, all of it together with the step of the time with the content of the time with the control of the opposite time to destroy them, so to clean them to hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't challenge the picture unless he was clean -- she was significant, and it would have been recorded by his dream.
We had lucky with the clean behavior.
We tell the water of an amazing level.
It is very easy to give more the pictures as well.
As Kenya, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relationship to photos.
He had begun to clean them up but he stopped to realize that it was even more.
I also had delicious.
Without them, the images of his wife and his own face would not be been become recorded, we could support the images in a single picture and represent the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared something from their story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a bomb station between the very far front of where it used to be his house, but their colleagues recognize it.
The day of the tuna, his husband was the surgery of close to the subject.
He had to go inside the water while the search sounds like.
Their little children, not so small now, but his two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took it a week to find all his family and know that they all survive.
The day he gave him their pictures his less single son 14 years.
For it, despite all of this, these pictures were the best gift that I could do it, something that he could do something that he could actually remember from the past that would not have been killed by that day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 100 volunteers had gone up to there Hans hundreds of them helped us clean to hand more than 150,000 pictures the big majority -- the big majority came back to hands of their dreams.
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us go back to 90 families of totally researcher and recorded pictures.
For this time, we really don't spend more than 100 in teams and materials -- most of the printers for printers.
We take pictures of it.
One photo is a picture of someone or something, a place, a relationship -- somebody wanted.
They are graduate from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us, but the first thing we're going to look for.
And about this was the project of responsible to the small pieces of humanity, back to someone their connection with the past.
When a picture like this is going back to somebody, it has a huge difference in the life of the person who gets it.
This project also made a great difference in the life of the resources.
Some of them connected to them with something bigger -- to go back to something, using their talent for something that are not model of perfect skin.
To end up I'd like to read this electronic room. He sent it City the day I came back from Japan after six months.
Meanwhile, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in images.
One particular picture, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, meetings around a baby, I became a baby, because a similar picture of my family, my mother, my mother, I and my daughter was born, it takes out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.  Solar.
I gave Edinout interviewer us and curiosity with this picture of a ball that goes through a manipulation in an exhibition of just a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion children per second.
I introduce you a new kind of photograph -- photographers? A new technique so fast that it can create video videos of light in movement.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the records, beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using three three, and they challenge really the idea of camera.
If I take a laser point and I put it up and hit it in a little bit of a second or it is, in several females to create a picture of pictures of just a million and a million pictures of a mile.
And that piece of pictures -- that ball, travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common ball.
If we take that ball and this picture of pictures and we show in this bottle, how do those pictures do inside this button.
What is the aspect of light in line line?
Now, all of this --   remember that all of this happens effectively in less than a nanotome is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times more slow so you can see light in movement.
Cochaine is not assigned this research --  They have a lot of things in this film, to bring this information to show what's going on.
The pull, our ball, go into the bottle with a picture of pictures that starts to turn it up and that, inside it starts to depressed.
Part of the light goes to the table, and we started to see these societies.
Many of the pictures finally come to the shoes and then explore in several directions.
As you can see, there is a air bubble that reduces in the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the representations of the upper part of the bottom of the bottle -- after several charts, that the resources are connected.
Now, if we take a common and short ball and we make the same distance and look at the same distance and look at a hundred billion times, how much do you think that we would take us to feel that film.
One day, a week, actually a year.
It would be a very boring film --  from a bank back in movement.
And what about trying to do with dead nature.
You can see the waves that get away from the table, the table and the wall of the bottom.
It's like to bring a stone in a start.
It's the way that nature paint a picture, I thought, from a female at the time, but of course, our eyes see an international compassion.
But if you look at one more time this talk, you will realize that, as the light starts out of the talk, it goes down.
Why? Because the talent is material and light in its inner and it goes back after several trillion billions.
In the future, when this female is in your mobile phones -- they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and version if the fruit is marriage without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at MIT.
As photographs, you know, if we take a picture on the bottom -- it gets very little light.
But we're going to look at a billion times faster than the most short exhibition -- so you will just go into something of light.
We won that ball, that picture of photos -- millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very abstract synthetic, we took those data giants and we train them completely to create those feedbacks that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crowd and protect them in interesting ways.
You can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a super-seat future would allow you to see after the records?
The idea is that we could bring some light on the door, research, to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light retrons.
It's not fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our female.
behind the wall there is a manifestation and we will take light on the door.
After the police of our article in Nature Community.
And a small fraction of pictures will go back to the camera, but interestingly, at the moments slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our female, has unique skills.
It has very good temporary revolution, and you can look at the world to the speed of light.
So we know the distance to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it goes up to the distance.
When you provide a leader you can get a picture of protection, which, you see in the screen, it really doesn't have any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we'll put them together and try to analyze the multiple regions of light, and with that, can we see the close object.
Can we see it in 3D.
This is our resource.
We have things to explore before you get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collections with what is to the back of the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light by the open window.
Or we could build encourages to see the inside of the body self-estemman surgery, and the same thing for carbon.
But of course, because of tissue and blood this is pretty difficult -- so this is actually a loss to scientists to start thinking about photography as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of information in the next generation.
So as I gave Delay, he was a scientist, it turned the science in art, an art of surprised pictures.
I realized that all of the data of data that we collect every time they're not just for scientists, but we can be able to be.
We create a new form of computer photograph with slow camera and color code.
And let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few trillion seconds.
But here also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves under the step, these are coming out of us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost to the speed of light, we have strange effects -- to Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events in the world sometimes appear to the camera.
By applying the construction of space and time, we can run this distribution.
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A cell can change life, and you give you the individual freedom.
With a phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Sweden.
With a mobile cell you can take a message and start a protein in Egypt.
With a mobile cell you can get a song -- it can go to Supermark and make a famous thing.
This is all possible with a phone.
I'm a child of 1984, and I live in the city of Berring.
Let's go back to that moment, this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people tried to look for a change.
This is the open of 1998, imagine if all these people who are presented in looking for a change, they had a mobile cell phone.
Who from the present have a cell movie?
Let me.
They take your mobile mobile phones.
Let's go. A Balance, a Black, was a guy.
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a phone.
But today I talk about me, my mobile phone, and how it changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 percent lines of information.
It's drawing data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2007, the U.S. company presented a direction.
The Darwin Disability Director.
This direction says that every European phone company -- every privilege of the Internet of the whole Europe, has to store a whole range of information from the users of the users.
Who is called who it comes up to who it comes up to who it comes up to it.
Who comes up with a text to who I send it.
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is started at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their provide of the Internet.
And in all Europe people had gone and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data of data.
We want the approach in the digital age, and we don't want the phones to the Internet of the Internet to get all this information on us.
There were advanced, personality, streets, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and said, "Bible, not fear."
And some even said that this would be the State two.
The State was the secret police of English English.
And I also asked me if this works really work.
Can all of this information about us?
Every time I use molecule?
So I asked my phone, Decondit Telescope, which at that time was the largest phone company in Germany, which please would send me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them one time, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all balloon, black.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're putting my life.
So I decided to look at a Jewish demonstration because I wanted to have this information.
But Delicious Telescope said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of the end of the end.
I would take the demand and they send me the information that I could.
While the Triang Constant Telling the including is the including for the German law of the U.K.
So I got this face on sea with a city in a CO2.
And in the city there was this.
It tries and five billion income lines of information.
At the beginning I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge artist. OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this artist.
It was a bit specific, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data resistance.
So next to Seven Olive and Open Darwin City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can go back and go back, go back and forward.
You can see every step that I do.
And you can see how I go from France in the train of Collapse, and what often I call in the treatment.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple times.
Then they call me some friends and they call me between them.
And then you call the other, and the other to the other, and we ended up with this great network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate between each other to what time they call each other, what time they die.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talk to who, who gives you an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is adapted at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berring, in the 19th of 1989, they had a mobile cell phone.
And the State would have known who participate in this protein, and if the State had known who the leaders were the leaders, this would never happen.
The East of the Berlin is perhaps never happened.
And in conclusion, not the East Contract Country.
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information of us as possible inside and outside the website.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to store them forever.
But the approach and living in the digital was not a contract.
But today you have to fight for adventure.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go back home to give your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not happening in the way.
When you go home, let me give you to their represent that only because companies and state agencies can store certain information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company, what information of you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for adventure in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hollywood TED, what happened?
It's not enough.
Hollywood TED, what happened?
I call Man Kanya and I'm not early, but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have brain parallels, that's why all the time.
Look at.
It's a strange. I'm like a microbe of Shakespeare.
And Monto Asia.
Per C. Check.
It's not connective and it can be continued.
No one took my mother on my mother and I didn't control it because my parents were first brothers, even though they are.
It just happens for accidents, like the one that happened to me in the nation.
Now, I leave you, I'm not source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of the present.
It feels wrong for me, because at some point of life, you've wanted to be depressed.
Let's go from past.
So Kavines of Christmas are in the commercial center, they drive in circles in a statement and what do you see?
16 empty places for discoveries.
And they think, God, I can be at least a little bit discovered."
Also, I tell you -- I have 99 problems, and Mr. CA: It's just one of them.
There will be an operation of operation, I would win the gold metaphor.
I'm painting, music, woman, discovered and live in New Reserves.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Paul Climate in New Reserves.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same increasing.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, it could be.
A lot of people with brain parallel don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the can't be about."
My father was -- "You can do it, you can make it down."
If my three older brothers called me cleaned.
If my three older brothers were going to public school, my parents gave to the school system, and they used to make sure that I was also outside -- and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- we all received my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years playing my talents in their feet and just walking up.
Another technique that I used was to play a dollar in front of me to get it up.
The strategy that I took inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the face of childhood was walking like a white campaign that has received many bones.
When I grew up, there were only six robots in my city and were all the family.
Now there are 20 robots, and they continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't an intelligent.
This was before 198 and the politicians would think about the "profit to the Muslims as a campaign line.
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith.
It was not open, it seemed to worry about a lot to die from hunger during the rain.
I told you that it had enough great enough to live three months without eating -- so I'm going to help you get out of the grandmother is very easy.
Barry take in Brazil.
Yes, in Brong. It's crazy.  My parents could not pay physical therapy -- so I was born to dance school.
I learned to dance with tons, or I can walk with tons.
I'm from New Reserves, and there we want to be kid, so if my friends used tons, I too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vaccines in the coast of Remer, I didn't go.
I spent my summer in a war area, because my parents tend to do that if we didn't go back to Palic every summer, we would become Maria.
In summer vaccines often my father was trying to hold me up, so I drink high step on the room, I was put up in the Marine Sea, and I remember the water took my eyes and I thought, "I mean, work?"
But the military cure was the game.
I have to say that it's very boring -- but before I did a story of supply was a supercomputer computer that I couldn't put it up and so one.
And now I can support in the head.
My parents came up with this idea that I could do anything -- that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the general hospital.
I went to college by the positive distribution and I got a back for the United States, University of the state of Aristot, because it was in all the countries.
It was like the map of the theater department.
They all loved me.
I did all the tasks of the less smart the times -- I took the next note in my class, and also in their class.
Every time I did a scene of the subject of critical my teachers called the professors.
But I never got a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the U.S. decided to make a work called Balan very slow in Japanese.
It's a piece of a girl with brain parallel.
I was a girl with brain parallel.
So I started to reduce the four views, "The end will have a paper.
I have brain parallels.
At the end of the free.
Thank you to God and the end I'm free."
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to Sherma Brond.
I was going to think of the director of the theater department of the theater, critical story, as if someone had killed my cat -- to ask me why and she told me that because they believed that they couldn't do the risks of risk.
And I said, "Depression, if I can't do the risk, you can't do the person?
It was a role for which it literally was born and gave it to an action without brain parallel.
The university was discovering my life.
Hollywood has a story of adding actors without disability for disabilities of discoveries.
And when I got home, I went home, and my first active sand was as strange in a telescope.
My dream was done.
And I knew it would be a capable of "movement to better friend in a sand.
Instead, I went out there as a barrier, I didn't see more than the cloud, and it was obvious for me that the report directions were not going to control global actions -- not white, with discovery.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rules.
I grew up watching Google Golden, Robert Barren, Element, and all these women had one thing in common -- they were common.
So I made me humanitarian.
In my first wave took famous chemicals from New York to New Reserve to New Reserve, and never forget the face of the first chemistry that led when I was going to high speed by the Australia of New Reserve with a driver that had brain parallel.
I worked in closes from all the United States, and also in Arab in the Middle East, without center and without it.
Some people say I'm the first monkey of the Arab world.
I never like to fix the first place, but I know that they never heard that small role that says women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2009, my brother of another mother and father -- Dan Electronic, and I launched the Fear of the National Science of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the Americans in the media of communication, and at the time to remind them to the reproduction directions that Australia and Arab are not situation.
It was a lot more easy than fight against the challenge of the spiritual state.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the news program program container at Sent Wilder.
I walked up as if I went to a graphic dance -- I was brought to a study and sat on a course of globals.
I looked at the direction and I said, "Depression, you can give me another step?
She looked at me and said, "Finger, four, three, two.
And we were in alive.
So I went up to the desk writing to not go out of the screen during the second, and when I ended up the interview -- I was playing.
At the end I had my opportunity and the discovery -- I knew they weren't going to send up.
But not only Mr. Well Wold went back to invest, but I was kind of kind of a complete time and I put my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith Wolden was that people in the Internet are school.
It says that kids are critically, but they never got a little bit of girl.
And suddenly my disability in the Internet became good object.
I look at climate climates like "What the textilet is "The text.
Is it researcher."
And my favorite favorite.
What disease does it have?
We should really run for it."
A computer suggested even that I would add my disability to my collaboration, which was controlled, particularly, particular.
The disability is as visual as the race.
If someone in the ground can't make Benefic -- then Ben can't make someone in the country of somebody.
The discoveries are the -- yes, application, man.
The discoveries are the largest minority in the world, and the most represented in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I won't walk up, but I'm here in front of you.
However, to have grown with the media media, I don't think it was.
I hope we can create more positive images of disability in the media and the everyday life.
Maybe if there would be more positive images, that would make less hate in the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My tourist has taken me to very spectacular places.
I was going to walk through the red red flow by the developing role of television Supermarkets and the Classic Lab Arabic.
I came to act in a film with Adam Sanda and working with my pain, the incredible David Mars.
I came up with the world by getting "The Arab to get up light?
I was depressed in representation of the great state of New Reserve in the CO2 of 2008.
And I founded "The kids of Manhattan, a benefit organization to give kids a nation of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me in life, and he gave him this talk to his memory.
He stops patient, paper.
I call Man Kanya, and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little kid of a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
I live in a little village to South Something.
This village is near Molard.
The second is called the little town to poverty and the edge of the invention.
With nothing for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, Mousting capital capital capital.
When you get there, there are no opportunities -- there's no work, no work of future.
He was just living in a box in the city of Molards.
After maybe a traditional year, nothing.
One day is about a lady that offers him to take it to strange, then to find, to detect.
You know a group of people who give him a destroy.
It gets a little bit of money so that you buy new clothes, money to send home, their family.
They present a young one.
It finally goes home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Molard, under a blue sky, it is a bomb car.
That little kid of that little village with dreams of the big culture was the surface terrorism, and that dynamic group of people were to the Sahara, an terrorist organization connected with the Sanda.
So how about the story of a little kid in a little village trying to get their dreams in the city end with him invited?
He was waiting on.
I was waiting a opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting a future of future, and this was the first thing he came up.
This was the first thing that we call the period of wait."
And his story is represented in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the markets, young urban urban people who have developed distributions in Johnson, determined distributions in London, which look for something beyond the "percentage of hope."
For young people, the big dream of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of work, working, but young people don't participate in the property of their cities.
It often is the violence that suffer from the highest straight stress.
For 2009, three of five people who live in cities will be less than 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the story of the wife of hope, the deal of access to terrorism -- the violence, to the violence, to be the story of the cities two.
And in my hometown city, Moustian -- 70 percent of the young is studying.
70 percent doesn't work, it doesn't go to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to Moladom last month, and I went to visit the Madia hospital, the hospital where he was born.
I remember going to be to that analyzed hospital to beautiful, and if I would never have you?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same "Peter "Partner."
Would I have become terrorisms?
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in Mountain that month was actually to get up a few young leaders in a company company.
And I went up to about 90 state leaders.
We sat and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges that face the city.
One of the young people in the room was Anderson.
He went to the University of Molard, it was free.
I had no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graphic universe, showing, surrounding it was the perfect white for Stanford and other terrorist organizations, to be recorded.
They looked for people like it.
But this story takes a different way.
In Molari, the biggest obstacles to get out of the B are the streets.
Ventilation years of civil war have built completely the visual system, and a motivation can be the most easy way to move.
Adam saw an opportunity and the representation.
It started a motorcycles company.
It started standing motivations to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of things for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different story.
I think your ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the "painting."
I photographed young people to be the creatures of economic opportunities that are looking for so depressing.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mom Mongoland, a flower.
I was helping you train some of the young people in the culture of the company and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business investigation.
In fact, it's the first flow that Mountain has seen in more than 22 years, and until Mom came up, until Monora came up, if you wanted flowers for your bottom, used to be a plastic self-estem from the extraction.
If you asked somebody, "When was the last time you see free flowers?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be.
So, Mountain saw a opportunity.
It started a company of passion and fluid design.
He created a farm in the outside of Molard, and he began to grow teams and lights, which was going to survive the hard climate of Molard.
And he started the flowers of flowers for countries, creating laws in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park park in 122 years.
There are no public parks in Molard.
It wants to create a space where families -- young people, you can go together, and, as he says, smell the private risks.
By the way, he doesn't grow red because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mountain had a really profound impact in young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NASA, working for the government, but his story, their innovation, really had a strong impact about them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
And I took them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs that could be artificial artists.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges that the city.
They had business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired the young people and create a company of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need experience and organization to get them in the development and put their business.
You connect the young people with the resources that they need to give you the support that you need to go from connection to creation, and they create carbon for urban growth.
For me, the company spirit is something more than start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Momman is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park Park, this is how it calls it, when it's created when it's created to transform the way people see their city.
They add kids from the street to help the store and keep the things for him.
I gave you the opportunity to escape the paradigm of the "painting."
These young companies are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, they become young people in entrepreneurs -- they include and feed their international innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the peace that anti-positive and "Pacebook of hope."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to carry with my dad in the Mandaria Mountains, an area in the north of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The content back.
The sun made the leaves blow as a violence, and not to be the way that we followed -- almost we can figure out that we were the first human beings to spend that land.
We got to our campaign.
It was a corrupt in a risk with view to a beautiful creature when I discovered something horrible when I discovered something.
Because of the corruption there was a base, about four square meters with hands of hands of human paper balls and high paper.
And I was analyzed, I was very closed and incredibly confusing.
The changes that were too perfect as to take what they had brought up, who thought he was going to clean your face?
That question went up with me, and it was established a little bit.
Who clean our base?
No matter as an organization or where do you put the outside, who clean our base in States."
Who clean our base in Rio or in Paris or in London.
So here in New York, the Department of the clean Sanita Department of the career of 19 tons of descriptions and two 300 tons of religious products every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the universe and take that card?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their traditions and interviewed people in office and institutions around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an international.
I needed to get into more.
So I began to work as a base record.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks -- I drive them.
And I would operate the mechanical schools and bar the snow.
It was an amazing privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the sun.
It's there, but it's not as predictable as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one is surprised quickly.
It costs a lot of to survey the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies are following the weight to bring on their body tons of coast every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Facebook of Laboring Stations, the waste of waste is one of the ten more dangerous concepts of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and go around the day and go around.
They just want to happen, so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for work.
And also the foundation is full of dangerous dancers that often fall out of the road and provide terrible days.
I also learned about the basic base.
When you get out of the concept and you see a city from the bottom of the way, you can understand that the base is like a force of nature in it.
I never stop coming from.
It's also like a form of research or circulation.
It must always be in movement.
And it's also the system.
It seems to me that the system is especially ironic because I think that resources are the most important work hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first projects of public health.
If you don't get rid of the descriptions in efficient and effective every day, this starts to get rid of their continents and their intelligent danger are threatened in very real ways.
The diseases that we had controlled for decades and centuries go back and start to give us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have space for the new thing for what the emotions of the economy start to do when it's in danger in danger.
I'm not addressed by capitalism -- only the relationship of it.
And then there is what I call our average average speed of a day.
And I mean just to the speed that we used to move in the time in the time.
We usually don't worry about, or we came up, we call them or take us out of our coffee, our color ball, our ball of water.
We use them, we take them, we forget them from them, because we know there's a work of work on the other side of it.
So today I want to show you a couple of ways of thinking about the research of waste that maybe help reduce the system and put them into that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost literal.
They're on the street every day, in the street form.
They use a universe in many cities.
You know when you wait them.
And their work allows us to do our work.
They're almost a form of advice.
The flow that keeps us out of ourselves, from our own descriptions, our own designers, and that flow always must stay in a form or another.
One day after September 11 of September 2008, I heard the graduate of a record room of waste record in the street, I would add my little son and brought out the scale room, and there was a man doing his paper record of paper as I did all the microscopes.
And I tried to thank you to do his work that day in particular, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just attended, and he said, "We're going to be good.
We're going to be good.
Shortly after that began to research the waste of waste and went back to that man.
It's called Papen, we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be good.
But in our efforts for collecting the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have in account all the costs -- even the very real human cost of the work.
The musical researchers, what we think when we talk about base, represent three percent of the restaurant of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean the base of you, take a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to tell you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are sitting in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia, and the other in Tuni.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspective are becoming an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several steps in the capital of Ethiopia, Aristoth Abean.
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out right."
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to restart.
In first, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't give the luxury to buy things.
Second, you need to make a lot of energy because the research with crisis generates heat in the bottom, so it's a lot of encouraging.
In a city where this is not supposed to happen because it's a text climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, your aspect has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a piece trying to take a very rich place in culture and transportations.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really careful with the ancient market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, they go and buy things all the days to little visions.
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a model building, of several steps, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by looking at the site, which is forced in an area of a lot of growth growth -- where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, they didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, using all the conditions of the building.
And this is spread with a strange attack that creates a space at the air in the building that is attractive, for their own way, the sun and the rain of it.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small business, which changes in every step because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building.
I wanted to find a solution to respond to local climate conditions.
And I got to think about a similar tissue to a shark of ants to allow the air in the air, and also the light, but in a failure way.
Then we inspired in these beautiful buttons of the strangers of the extractions.
They have the properties of the front geometry, and this helped me to model the failure.
We are building that with these small pieces of pieces that are the windows that let the air and light in a way controlled to the inside of the building.
This is completely completely with these little colors of colors that use the light of the building of the building to excite the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't have easy to convince development because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what we ask."
But we all realized that this idea of the market would actually be a lot more researcher than the commercial center because at the end of them there were more local to sell up.
And also, the idea of the failure was a lot more economic -- not just because of the material in compassion with glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have an air adding.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve energy addition for the building in a city where electricity gets almost every day.
So we got a great advantage putting pictures on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and barriers that would create this urban case.
And these parts in the roof -- which is a set of water for the health sands.
It is waiting for the first year, because we go through the fifth step of the building.
The second example is a teacher of 200 apartments and services in the city of Tuni.
And to make a project so big, the biggest thing that I had design, needed not only to understand the city of Tuni, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I had special attention in the middle of the middle, a 100 years of animal that was surrounded by a wall with double doors of access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design of design that we did was to apply the existing streets -- creating 12 similar balls in size and features that there is in Barbaria and other cities of Europe with these patients.
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relationship with the idea of the data in the international lines with recent lines, and this made the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell cell cell -- like a special part of the teacher plan.
I thought, what would be the best organization for an apartment in the medicine climate?
And it's northern -- because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventility.
So we put a school that suggests that most of the apartments are perfectly order in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with patterns, and then on the low plant we have all the connections for the penis.
And also response to the local rules that make a greater density in the upper levels and a less density on the low planet.
And also this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like recording to the community the space of the conference by construction.
It's where all of the neighbors, you can go up and social, and make activity such like running a two miles in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people change communities and local economies at the same pace that grow the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but associated, which improve the relationship between community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was so remarkable as you see all the new girls.
I had great amounts of hair and a little bit of light, line -- it was very strong for the capitals of states, very good for article.
I ended up that year and I was full of gentlemen, until I brought my own plan.
One day after the sale of the school. It was a little afternoon, and I was written on the gallon of girls.
When the cost was depressed, I went out in the class room, I took out of the table of my teacher the book of capitalism.
And then I did.
I add the capabilities of my right, just a little bit, just some like this.
All of this --  And I was willing to go back the book to the box, but to see, some of my other companies had very good notes as well.
So in a free, I covered the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them out of Dea and myself.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never addressed.
This is that everything was completely obvious.
They never found me.
But about all, I described the reason why I was used that this child, so small, it was so good for article.
And I got you interactive.
They're so mysterious and so presential.
We know that babies suffer from beautiful.
It also prisons. The blue birds are very propositive.
We know that cells are the number one of the nations in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that opens the solution, or the long death or the strong.
So you have to go to fiction because the novel is like the lab that they study the hair in all their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exercise to say that if there was no gentlemen, there would be no literature.
Well, there would not be Hellond the infinite, no "Well."
There would not be cell and the billion and a night."
There would be no Shakespeare.
They were going to go out of the laws of remote school, because we would be losing the France and the Fundamental -- there would be no "Pathering or "Fine, and we would have no "Parkinger or "Western Bond."
Without gentlemen, there is no Proster. I know that it is in order to say that Program has the answers for all, and in how much the gentlemen, almost all of them.
This year is a 100 years of his straight or the measure of the loss time, the most successful study of sexual cells, and also from the original compassion, I mean, all that we could have --  And thinking about Project, we have the sensory details, right?
We think of a child trying to fight the dream.
We think of a human magic in you of land.
We forget about how hard that image.
We forget that it is.
I mean, this is books that Virtual Jone said were as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat theory, but we assume it's surprised.
So let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the cells, the hair and Proster.
It will be very obvious as the cells, which are reduced to the person, to your design, to their professions, are a great narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel cells.
When we feel challenges, we tell us a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
It will be at the time and the audience and the audience, we know exactly what details include, to raise the chair, right?
They make us all of the advanced newspapers, and that's something that I proposed to understand.
All that she does to give me a pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, I proposed that every cold love that Sanda detect in his love, it opens up to their collection of tradition in their private camera.
You have to admit that San and Proster, they were absolutely beautiful.
You know, the programs of Proster would have to get the country, if they wanted to break with him.
But you don't have to be so beautiful to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
They are advanced.
It's a human emotion. You have to feed it.
And what is the cells?
The wires are born from information.
They use the details.
And they like the great amounts of bright hair and the little bit of light.
They are born from photos.
This is why Internet is so successful --  I proposed the language language with the cells.
When San is in your head of gentlemen, so soon you hear behind the doors and sound substances to the sense of their love, then it means those behavior.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is representative, but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or look at a monkey."
He says, "It's social research with real intelligent value.
I proposed is trying to show that the wires are interacting and make us seem underwater, but in their mind, they're search for knowledge, a painful truth -- in fact, to what I proposed to contain, how much more painful the truth is better.
The pain, the human person, learning -- these were the governments to the Protection of Proster.
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us suffer in us a lot of more profound feelings and visions than a wise man that can be interested."
Is it telling us that we're going to look for crime women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the challenges are solved to ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us open in this particular way.
Is there some other emotion of our activity, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that taught us to look at how permanent intensity?
It was writing about this further.
One day, Frank was visited by a young young young man that is considered with the idea that his woman would get it.
And Francisco says that there was something strange in that man, who didn't look at what their wife did.
So she was incredible." Everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under any cause.
But he was looking for things that did their wife, without giving me, influence behavior.
Do you sound too much a lot of some many or access to a man.
Francisco says that the man was becoming the construction of your wife.
The novel are very good at this.
The novel describes very well how the challenges do to look at interest but without pressure.
In fact, how much more incredibly beautiful we are, more we become researchers of the fantastic.
And for this reason, I think, cells take us to make violent or illegal act.
The challenges are going to share us in completely income ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at eight years, I recognize it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in news.
A woman of Michael 15 years of age was captured by having created a false account in Facebook since which was sent messages visitors, horrible to itself, for a year.
For a year. It's all a year.
She was trying to put up to the new novel of his non-term example. I have to trust that when or this, they react with architecture.
Because we are reality.
What a huge thing, even though farmer, creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a navigation of Partino High.
Highard is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from American literature.
This is the automotive of "The Extens in a Tree, and "The Talenter Mr. Repuls, books that are trying to how the gentlemen, trust our minds, and once we are in the stage, in the brain of the cells, the memory that would be seeing what might be, can be performed in a institution.
Take Tomo Repullion, their most famous character.
I took Jelahon Role or want to want what you are going to be able to get out of your being, and to be able to get out of what you ever had, and it's under the floor, you answer your name, it takes your angles, empty your banks career.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take a Turkey Rolley.
I can't give you the whole world, as much as I sometimes want.
It's a light, because we live in the sense of environment.
We live in time.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where is the money investment? Right?
Now novels show us the sale, I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they are to a mystery.
Let's go to the 2118 of Baby Street and we asked for Shellow Hollows.
When people think about Hollows, you think of the malaria in the Morality Merchar, that criminal generation.
But I've always been prepared by the Reserve Institute, the Head face of San Arab who needs Hollywood depressed, needs the Hello of Hollow, but he means it.
Oh, it sounds so familiar with me.
The response needs their help, but it needs to be researcher, and it was basically basically border in each of the minutes.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Sandain And the Sister Sandscared And once the Hollow was in the Singles Nations, once Hollywood comes back to the Hollow and says, "We are not cell, Mr. Hollywood.
We're proud of you."
And he tells him there's no person in Scott Africa who didn't want to fix your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see Hollywood translated in history. It looks very exciting. That scene is also missing, right?
It seems to treat the hair as a geometry problem, no emotion.
You know, in a minute Hollywood is the opposite side of the State.
At the next minute.
Suddenly, Perman is allowed to admire that idea of being him the answer.
Could it even be so simple.
What if the challenges are really a generation issue -- just a question where we allow us to be in relationship with the other.
Well, maybe we don't have to respond from the exception of the other.
We can add with it.
But I like the plants of continent.
So as we hope that it happens, we remember that we have the fiction for conflict.
It's just the distribution despite the hair.
The fiction used to be the distance, you invite them to the table.
And look at what they started, the Delated Death, the Lab Turkey Rule, the local Salar Professor."
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The age of Julia Julie, Business Salar went out of the World 19th of the Pole 11 and he went up on the Marine Mark.
Arming and Albert were alone, but their presence in the free surface is the climate of a collective collective process.
The Play program was the biggest movement in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 150 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Play gave work to about 400 people and asked the collection of 20,000 companies, college and government agencies of government.
They died people including the talent of the Plast one.
But before the Professor Play program, 24 men came to the moon.
It plays on their surface, from which Alberts after the death of Armor last year, is now the most animal.
So why did they do?
They didn't take a lot of the back -- 38 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 would make them later, a new sense of the small and the frequency of our common home.
Why did they go? The cancer answer is that they were because the Pennage President wanted to show the subsities, which this nation had better chocolates.
But the words of Kenya in the University of Richard in 1989, they give us a better idea.
John F. Kenyan: Some questions, why the Lovel?
Why do it turn into our goal.
And they could also ask, why would it scale the highest mountain?
35 years ago, why will fly on the Attention."
Why do I play Richard against Texas."
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
James Potentian, for the contents, the Play was not just a vision of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the most strong emotion was the massive of the transportation of the power of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do it.
The land in the moon happened in a context of a long technological transportation.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of the infrastructure and the airplane and the penicillin and the vaccine for transportation.
In half of the century, it wrote the policy and emerges the virus.
The technology seemed to be able to put the Space Tollow in 1990, called "The Accessible "Facebook."
For most of the history of human history, we can't go faster than a horse or a ship with it, but in 1998, the talent of the Player 10 flew to 40 miles or hour.
From 1990, no human being has come to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Talk of the Plast 10, and the optimistic joy on the power of technology has been shown to see that technology will solve that technology will solve that technology will solve that technology will solve that technology will solve the cancer, or feed the world population seem to have been inspired into the world.
I remember looking at the Plast 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that you don't look at the scale of the Sachard Samal.
I knew that this would be the last mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colleagues in Mars.
So that from something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology, has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologies have shown us and they had come up with traditional toys, things like iPhones, applications and social networks, or algorithms that accept the authority window.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have applied and convinced our lives.
But they don't solve the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a particular explanation in Silicon Valley, which connects that they have created less ambitious companies than those of the years in which the Internet, Microsoft, Michael and Genera.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the teachers, in conclusion, the incentives that the risk capital capabilities offer companies.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk produced that it changes the creation of three-dimensional ideas by the financial problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risks of risk were on his crazy point without worried about the risk, they prefer small investors that they could go out in 10 years.
CA: They have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is a long piece. They have never invested in the developing technology development to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons that we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound problems.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars will require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global power of energy produces from renewable energy sources like solar and the electricity and the biological -- less than two percent, and the reason is completely economy.
Care and natural gas are more cheap than solar energy and electricity, and oil is more cheap than the biological of the biological.
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price. They don't exist.
Now, the technologies and the economists and economists are according to what politicians and international tried to invest the development of an alternative energy -- mostly a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the carbon price.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America or international tried to reflect that conversation.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technology, it turns out not to be.
We know from time that men are result of the failure of food report.
But 30 years of research have taught us that men are political crisis that affect the food distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like costs or systems for attack and support of food, but there are men while there were bad government.
Finally, the big problems sometimes have a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
The Nigeria President will tell you the war in 1998, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some relatively resistant kinds of cancer, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective and visualization treatment.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have to be present -- the political leaders and the population should want to solve the problem, the institutions have to support the solution, should be really about a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Piloto Mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, and it is just with those crisis.
But it's a complex model in the future.
We're not in 1998.
There is no gravitational competition like in the Cold War, there's no policy like John Kennedy who has been doing the hard and the dangerous thing, and there's not a popular science of science science as the solar system.
In general, going to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem.
We're just in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by giving you the general ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they have become climate of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a record -- there's been a great distribution of trust, is a very general belief of conservation.
The second is a goal, we should have more trust.
And the third is a task -- we should collect the trust.
I think the record, the goal and the task have been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a record, a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has discovered.
And if I think about the base of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I was including to think that it can have gone into some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can go to the sources of view, and the sources of opinion are just the source of the belief that trust has discovered.
When you look at the sources of opinion over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were discovered 20 years ago, mostly performance and political and political and political and political and people are still inspired the same discovery.
And the people who were very conflict about 20 years ago, they continue to be quite conflict, games, feedbacks.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average city of the street is almost exactly half of the way.
But is this enough evidence.
So what the opportunity of opinion responses are, of course, operations.
What else can you recover?
What you look at is the genetic actors that people are menting when you make a certain questions.
Do you trust the politicians in the missions?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Do you contain the crimes?
Do you trust the paintings?
Control in the principle shows?
You probably started to ask, "What do you do what?
And that would be a very sensitive answer.
And you could say, when you have told your question, "Well, I trust some of them, but in other notes."
What's very rational about.
In definition, in real life, we tend to detect the confidence of different form.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a kind of an office, works or kind of person, it's going to be universal in all cases.
I could say, for example, to say that I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give you the kind of reading -- but in any way to drive the school microscope.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good condition.
I could trust my more crazy friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to get a secret one.
simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in the most abstract way?
I think the survey are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to obvious the good interview in fact to trust something or something.
Secondly, what about the goal.
The goal is to have more trust.
Francisco, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal I would think.
I would try to have more trust in what it's meaningful of trust, but not what it is.
In definition, I'm part of not to trust what it's not conflict.
And I think that those people who were determined with the very often called Mr. Male, that then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too conflicted.
You have more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
Depression confidence or negative with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you tell it, it says, yes, it's worth -- it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but conference.
So what it's about to do is to make a judgment about how conflict people are in determined ways.
And I think to be able to make a trick, we are forced to focus on three things.
Are you compositions." Are you honest? They're responsible?
And if we found that one person is completely completely in the personal materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be a condition of trust.
But if of course, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are companies and honest, but I don't trust them to take a letter to the right, because they're overall.
I have friends that are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they support their own companies.
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are competitive and responsible but extremely honor.
If it is, I still don't have participated.
But that's what we're looking for looking for -- confidence before it trust.
The trust is the answer.
The conference is what we have to play.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build consumers of contents for all sorts of institutions, professional sets, functions and others, that made us easier the task of playing their conference.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work.
I remember one time I was talking to a part and said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the adventure paper that will take the part in it."
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and institutional life, that the research system that is determined to get confidence and transportation evidence -- actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is to make the work of the people who have to make hard tasks like the parts, like the parts, by telling them that "Landia the cars, as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
All of that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more confident, and that things would be different if we try to be different if we try to be a consumption of trust and we will take people to be confident and if we try to determine whether other people, working or political or politicians are full of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trick, the simple actions -- the actions, which is not really done.
Third, the task.
It will call the task to rebuild trust, put things to the region.
I suggest you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of conference.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in definition, it's different because we have other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give you the enough basis so they can trust you.
You have to be a confidence of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get up, by the general, all the people, all the time.
But you also have to get happy evidence that you're a condition of trust.
How do you do that?
That makes a day, everywhere, makes the common people, the works, the institutions, very easily.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my capitals say I can turn them without giving explosions.
I take them and let me become the money, or change them by the color that I want.
That's strange. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good test that you're a condition of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're doing is not really hard to describe.
So what people trust is in the relationships, and in that market, you can determine when and how the other person is doctor of trust.
Thank you.
Since the companies of computers have come through to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be depressed.
This separation has been reducing, more and more and more and more and more than a day today is less than one feet, the spine of a car screen, and the power of computer has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there were no barrels?
I started to imagine how it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the opposite open against the screen is bringing their physical body to pills.
designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool is brought up the barriers.
But the two hands are still out of the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with digital information using all the head of hands?
In the director of Michael Chinese City, along with my mind Caral Blood, received the computer.
And by buying a transportation vision with democracy cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the texture, to get to the bottom of the 3D space, and to pull them directly with hands.
As the windows and the cards have a location in real space, self-controlled it is as easy as to take a book of a story.
You can honor the book and replace lines or words with the virtual car sensor that is under every floating screen.
Architects can be extracted or rotate their maps directly with hands.
In these examples, we enter the digital world.
And if we invest the paper and make digital information come to us?
Secondly, many of us will have bought and do things for the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual test.
This is the vision that comes from a device in the head or transformation when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this bigger idea, I thought, instead of just looking at pictures in space, how can we do that they are physics so that we can touch them and feel them?
How would it be a future like this?
In the middle of MIT Lab with my tour History Hill Audience and my collaboration Remember Post -- we created this only physical phone.
This script is shared as a picture in 3D in space, which means that so much the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
Simplicity, what we did was encourage gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic review, mechanical action and determines.
And when we program the object, the object, we release it from the restaurants of time and space, what it means to say that human movements can go back and go back and go back and go back to the physical world.
You can teach collaborations physically and distance and famous take from Michael Room can be represented as a physical reality the times we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planet, physics, and unlike the mountains or the text books, this is a real and parallel experience that you can play and feel -- it's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not just show us something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to discover from our world.
We started the talk today talking about a bar today, but if we assume that bar -- the only limit that is just our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a picture for two years in Hunger, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first degree -- the government wanted to bring up to a school for adults with all the patterns of the pages.
But my mother stops said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
And after survive the cultural revolution, they believed that there was just a closed path to happiness -- a safe work and well recorded.
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese person.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
And a lot of it has to start to train from very young to learn the artists, so I tried everything I could to go to the school school.
Until I wrote to the direction of school and the present of a radio program.
But no adult was saving the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends were like, but they were kids, without authority like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much greater to understand.
My dream would never be done.
And I think, during the rest of my life a happiness of second class was the only thing that could be applied.
And this was so incredibly.
So I solved to look for another vaccine.
Nobody else wanted to teach me, OK.
It turned to books.
"Babies Company from San California Charles Chees -- "Hey "show Her Human History, and what were the first books that I here?
Those who were professional in China, of course.
"The Good Earth is about Chinese campaign life.
And it's not complicated confidence.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth slide for me was a revolution, "Having your father and your mother.
"Harvard, I said, "It's so different, and much better than going to go."
So it became my tool to get out of this conference of conflict collection and to record the relationship with my parents.
And the encounter with a new culture also gave me place to my shared reading story.
Bringing a lot of perspective.
For example, at the beginning this map looked outside because this is what the students in China learn.
I had ever occurred to me, China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
It is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to the research field of research as computer religion and shared literature.
Compare and control, it offers the accidents a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the computer reading works to research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
You can try from people "Well Francisco From Wall Staring Frank African Arabic African Adams, who were involved in the same way, or friends with shared experiences.
For the Critic, technologies are economic and political and space.
For the Buddha, they're all psychologically, the subject, fear and the social should?
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
"The California Talk -- The Martin Theme Member Member Martin Sanda Sanda States instead of losing the tradition, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it is through the tradition that I realized that "Department literally means "The Facebook -- James.
And King in China, literally means new mother, Oh.
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feel just or impossible.
You have a really destroyed dream that's not really compared to what many other people have enough.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a destroyed dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books that I'm here, I'm happy today, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So books always get them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my two, I saw my first capita of psychology.
I was a dominant student in clinical psychology in Berroon.
She was a 20th woman called Alexander.
Alexander went into the first session using cars and a hole top, it was going to take in the sun of my office was taken up the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so little about it.
My kind of class had a picture as a very first climate.
And I got a ventilation I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't do it.
With the Chinese stories that Alexander brought up the senses, I became easy to move the head while we were down the solution.
"The trees are the new view, he said, Alex, and so I saw it, she was right.
You start to work later, you know, it has children later, until death happens later.
For windows like Alama and I had time to work.
But a little bit later, my survival.
I was responded.
I said, "Oh, it's coming out with guys under his career, it goes up with a head, but it's not as if it was to marry with it."
And then my survival said, "No no, but maybe it's married with the next one.
In addition, the best moment to work on Alth Mars is before it starts.
This is what psychologists call a moment "America."
It was when I realized that the three are not the new two.
Yes, people feel head after what it was used to, but this didn't make the 20th of Germany were a passion in their development.
This made the 20th of Alley were the perfect moment and we were depressing it.
And so I realized that this kind of genetic negative was a real problem, and he had real consequences -- not just for Alexander and their love life, but for the careers, the families and the future of the personal environments.
There are 50 million pensons in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider no one comes to the adult without going on before the two.
They raise your hand if you're in their two.
I want to see the windows here.
Oh, yeah, they're amazing.
If you work with the ventures, they love a ventilation, you take the dream a venture, I want to see -- it's good, incredible, the windows actually matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments -- that give your life to have spent for when they have 30 and so much.
And more than 40 people from more than 40 -- they don't go into the patient.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact about the amount of money they will win.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with his future for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their two and it is supporting for adult, which means that if there is something that you want to change themselves now, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their two than at any other moment of life, and we know that female fear comes to his table at 28, and things become complicated to 35 percent.
The two are the moment to educate about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and support in the brain.
It's a moment in which their daily and common life has an impact in the person who will become it.
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our two are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the windows are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the adult.
The researchers call the two a extraordinary advantage.
The personalities are taking raising names to the sells like "The streets and "The "Picks."
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a treatment which is actually the decade that define adults.
Leonardo Berring said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when they give you painting on the head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your life?
It doesn't happen.
They were surrounded to that person the sense of infrastructure and their ambition and not absolutely anything.
And then every day, smart ventures, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and they say something like that, "I know my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count -- I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "You all say that while you start a career before the 30 -- everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My two are to finish and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better crossing the day that I graduated from university.
And then it starts to sound something like this, "My girls for the two were like the game of the chairs.
They all run and they are fun, but then at some point around the 30, it took the music and everyone started to sit in.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be started, so sometimes I think I was married with my wife because he was the closest chair when he was 30.
Where are the windows here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but they don't get wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 30s, there is a huge pressure to the tree and so many of us start a career, choose a city, to choose a wall, and have two or three children in a period of time a lot more short time.
A lot of these things are not complicated, and there are research that start to show -- which is much more difficult and interesting to do everything in the 30s.
The crisis of the average age is not about buying red depressions completely.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
I realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
A lot of traditions and many of you see themselves, and to me, sitting on the room, and they talk about their 20s, "What was I doing? What was I thinking, what was I thinking, what was I thinking.
I want to change what the windows are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emm.
At the age of 25 Emer came to my office because he was in their own words, having an identity crisis.
He said that he would like to work in art or interview, but you still couldn't decide -- so I spent the last few years working as a message.
As it was more cheap, I lived with a novel who showed more temperature than antibiotics.
And despite to live about two very difficult two, his previous life had been even more difficult.
It was crazy in our senses, but then she was stopped to say, "You don't choose their family, but it can choose their friends.
Well, one day I had put his head on their legs and cry for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new free for direction, and he had spent all the morning with their many context, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words in emergency, please call it "the face.
I was at the point of the story when I saw and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an active accident.
Who is going to take me if you give me cancer."
At that time, I got a lot of work to respond and not say, "I do."
What Emm needed was not a trial that really would worry about.
Immer needed a better life, and I knew this was their opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alama as for just to sit while the average decade of Emm was going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emm three things that every venture, man or women, I want to know.
First of all, I said to Emm who would forget from that sense of identity and get care of identity.
By the capital of identity -- I mean to do something that makes it value to their person.
Make something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the emergence, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this -- capability of identity generates of identity.
So now this is the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that international, of that company that you want to prove it.
I'm not going to determine the visional exploration -- I'm getting up the exploration that shouldn't tell you, which, by the way, is not exploration.
It's property.
I told myself to explore jobs and I made them tell them.
Secondly, I told myself that urban tribes are surprised.
The best friends are great to take up to the airport, but the windows that go together with friends with similar minds are limited in how much you know, what you know, how you think, how they talk about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who will go out almost always comes from his closest circle.
The new things come from what they call two friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the windows have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak vehicles are the way to make this group.
Half of the workers created never published, then you know the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published in a job.
It's not to do transportation. It's the science of how information happens.
Finally, but not less important, I think you don't choose their family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a ventilate, emission soon to choose their family, when you have a wall and form their own family.
I told myself that time to choose his family had come up.
Maybe you think that the 30 is better age to feel head than 20 or even the 25 and I agree with you.
But choose to the person that you live right now, or you take you right now when everyone in Facebook starts walking towards it is not progress.
The best moment to work on your marriage is before you get it, and that involves being so interesting in love as you're in the work.
Choice your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to do it to work or kill time with who you get them to you.
So what happened with Emmed?
Well, we looked at that direction, and she found the fourth of a first one who worked on an art museum in another state.
This weak victim helped him get a work there.
That work of work gave him a reason to leave the girlfriend with the living that I live.
Now, five years later, it's special organization of events in music.
This house with a man who chose considered.
And I love his new career, I love his new family, and I sent a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency are not good enough.
The story of Emmed can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with the self-sensitive.
It's very easy to help them.
The windows are like advantages that come out of the organization of Los Angeles, who go back to some place of the step.
Right before the standard, a light adult in their trajectory makes the difference between land in Alabama or First.
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even at 2010, a good conversation -- a good design, a good TED talk can have huge effects in the next years or even in the next generation.
This is my idea to determine all the windows you know.
It's as simple as I learned to say to Alexande.
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to the views as Emm every day, the transports are not the new 2000s, they raise their adult, they have an identity of identity, they use their weak victims, they choose your family.
They don't stop to define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very successful job in general consumption for a work that was even more excited.
I went to teach you mathematics to the public state in New York.
And as any teacher, I applied examples and tests.
I give you tasks.
When the work came back, I calculated the capabilities.
What I called the attention was that CO2 was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better design had no CO2 populations.
Some of my most intelligent kids were not going to be so well.
And that puts me to think.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in strong statement, sure, are hard, professionals, the area of a paradigm.
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years of doctor, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from an emotional perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the better way.
It's the CA: But what if you have success in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in fast and easy.
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become psychological.
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of detailed stage, and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Milky Microsoft Settle Post.
We tried to predict what houses will stay in military training and who would be ready.
We went to the National Content of George and we tried to predict what children would get the most far possible in compassion.
We study young teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- asking what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school year and those who will be the most effective to improve the results of the learning of their students.
We care about private companies, asking you, what of these windows are going to keep their work of work?
And who is going to win more money?
In all those very different context, I came up with a characteristics as a major prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good approach, the physical health and wasn't the C.S.
It was detection.
Depression is passion and personalized to reach very long picks.
The definition is to have responsibility.
The definition is to add their future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the week, but for years and working really hard to do that future a reality.
The definition is to live life as if it was a mouse, not a career to all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the depression in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that made my detection issues, and then wait around more than a year to see who they would draw up.
It turns out that kids with more democracy had more significant likely to grow up, even when I was employed in every character that I could measure -- things like family income, the results of stranger trials, even the security that the kids were when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Post or in the National Content Content in which it matters the definition. It's also in school, especially for kids in risk of getting it.
For me, the most important thing about depression is the little thing we know, the little thing you know about science about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the democracy in the children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a kind of work?
How do you keep them into the long player."
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that the talent doesn't give them democracy.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of toxic individuals that simply don't follow with their companies.
In fact, in our data, the democracy is completely not related or it's even related to the table media.
Until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the democracy in children is something called "The growth "Memet."
This is an idea developed in the University of Stanford by Cartis Delay, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not a finger, that it can change with effort.
Dr. Delice has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to challenge, they're much more likely to look at when they fail -- because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mind is a great idea to develop democracy.
But we need more.
And that's where I end my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have in front of it.
We need to take our best ideas, our most strong institutions, and we need to prove them.
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail -- to wrong, to start all again with the lessons learning.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more described.
Thank you.
I grew up in Talifica as the daughter of a classic, one of my most advanced memories is my mother showing the beauty and the shape of Chinese cars.
Since that moment, I was wonderful by this incredible language.
But for an extraction, it seems to be as impossible as the Great Chinese Museum.
In the last few years, I have been asking if I can draw this death, so that you want to understand and learn the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw each of the pieces of every car in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic would understand 20 careers.
You just need a thousand to understand basic additionality.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read signs of transportation, feeling of transportation, to understand the basic idea of the website or the personalities.
Today, I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
They open their mouth as much as it is possible until it is completely.
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a past.
person.
If the form of the fire is a person with arms in both sides as if I was running in francisco way, "Alexander, I'm surprisingly. This symbol is actually original in the form of the call -- but I like to believe that it's in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors on the old side.
I call the radio to these eight cars.
They are building blocks to make a lot more cars.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's "the "to go."
As the old said, two are company, three are multiple.
If a person would be their arms, this person is saying it was like this big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is adapted.
It's a prison, as John inside the ball.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
They put a table under the tree, we have the circumstances.
They put a mouth on the tree, that's an "Hey,  easy to remember -- because a particular tree is pretty idea.
Remember the fire?
Two forces together, it becomes very hot.
Three forces together, that's a lot of calls.
They put the fire under the two trees, that's common.
For us, the sun is the source of property.
Two of them together, a property.
Three together, those are streets.
They put the sun and the moon broken together, that's the brilliant.
It also means morning, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door, put a screen inside the door, is the corrupt of the door.
They put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
To touch there is someone in home.
This person is coming out of a door, specifically, ending.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're described.
Three women together, they have care is adult.
So we've already happened for almost 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32 3.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort -- you'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of cars, which is the same thing you learn a eight years old.
So after knowing the careers, we started creating fragiles.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a fire. It's a value.
We know Japan is the land of the national sun.
This is a sun with the origin because Japan is at this of China.
So a sun next to the origin -- we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two months adopted one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in example, because Chinese companies were determined to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the ice has become coming out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a sale.
This is a slide to remember that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the films that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my children, when my daughter was four years, we saw the God magic together.
The film gives your imagination for months.
His favorite character was Glevin, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant version and take a magic variation.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and we created our children in a kind of industrial fantastic species.
However, the Miller magic was an accessible in itself.
I didn't start that trend.
The tendency really took up a lot of years later, completely another film whose prototypes, a metal girl and a pill boy recorded to a young girl as a failure of enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a great difference between these two movies, there is a couple of big differences between the mountain and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the World Male.
The monkeys are quite advanced, like the hands.
But I think if the God is made today, the mammal would say, Doho, you are the Salar saving as the program predicted it.
You use magic shoes to give the bit of the bit of the wonderful balloon computers.
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing from the Male magic is that the most healthy characters and sounds and even villages are women.
I started to notice this when I did to see Steve Washington to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the project because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the supermarket level had gone down.  And so it went up in the room and he was introduced as a mother on their patterns behind it, and I don't think he understood what happened, but unfortunately, I would take everything.
I ask me what it was.
Would it be values of value, personalized and land?
Would you have the sense that London is an army to deal to the government.
We compare this with the 1990 magic magic.
How do you win a mouse his film?
So making good men with all of them and being a line.
It's the kind of world where I want my children to create OK, right? And not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital force, force in the movies for our children, and so little from the road of family streets?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in children, and they should read it. It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this study.
I know for experience that the Law Leader doesn't provide the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of the adults that is million.  I think at the moment of the first beauty, I really hope that the crisis would start to get out because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search has finished, I have novel.
Why are you still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on drawing the glass and get their resource, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other advertising.
It's almost like being a child, you have to be an old animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war of war.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to define the principles of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though the kids are not really their objective audience.
They make a female work when you teach girls how to define the pattern, but they don't necessarily show kids how to define the pattern.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and traditional as Here and Kanasha, but they don't stop being films of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all the time continues to get up in classical after classical after classical after classical after the companies of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are running a girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came value.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in tensions.
Do you remember what the crisis said when I came value."
I can't believe that Piece has done a principle of a price.
It's very good. Don't let that stop them.
Well, almost none of these films spend the Beacher test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't been raised and already proposed, but maybe today we start a movement.
Sadly Belling is a distance of chimpanzees, and at the middle of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend about the evolution of the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you should do -- in the movie, there is more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to get the recording.
These women talk to each other at some point of the film.
Their conversations are about something else from the kid that so much like --  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It's going on. I've seen it, and yet I really see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie, Iraq.
Right? Rumpers of Standain, success of talk, an idea of what's a hole of Hollywood Hollywood.
Probably it doesn't happen the Beacher test.
And I don't think it should be, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a bomb where men and women are hidden during the crisis of the references.
We have a lot of stories of men who have deep conversations and pain in this school, and it's the great moment for one of the actions to take a look at the door and say, you come to the bed, faith.
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2010, from the 100 more popular films -- how many of them think they have feminist prototypes?
Okay. It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's good.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to describe this room.
Last year, the New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one of five women says that it's been adding second in their life.
I don't think it is the collection of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music video videos or population are totally visualized, but something wrong, and when I hear that story, one of the things I think is that there's a huge amount of sexual airplanes.
Who are those guys, what are those guys, what are those guys?
What do you don't learn to learn.
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a male hero is to cut into the village with violence and then cover the resource, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and don't talk about?
Are we searching that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of creating a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this particular statistics and we want to get them.
We have tools to our device as a poet pollen, and we hope that it helps -- but I have to ask you, but I have to ask you to ask you, the same time, active or passive -- are we educating our children to keep their male power.
I mean, I think the list of Newspaper is a way to do something really important, and here I mean the parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new discovery of men.
The definition of male is changing.
You have read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the street.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what their favorite character was their favorite character of Steve Sanda know what I said, "You know what I said, "I said, "What I said, "Do you know what I said, "Do you know what I said, "Do you know what I said, "Do you know what I said, "Do you know what I said, "Do you know what I said, "Do you know what
Obe.
Obe Kenya and Gland.
What are these two computers?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant version.
I think they're experiments.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than nobody -- and you love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my son, you see and fight only and more stories where you see that their work is to join a team -- maybe a team left by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the World Male.
Thank you.
As a kid, I lived in Manda and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea balls in the coast of Man because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these contents.
They're sand and it's hard to see them.
However, I was used to look for them.
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me get them to them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for past and architecture.
And finally when I started studying Egyptian, I realized that to see with my own eyes was not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt -- my little beach in Manda had grown up to one of almost 150 miles of legal along to Nine.
And my sea balls had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew that I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrastructure.
This is a place working on the U.S. East of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, it seems to be marriage, but when we use the infrastructure and we process it by using false color, suddenly the place looks like really brilliant room.
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape in the building materials and the activities of the ancient employees.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an ancient Egypt city, called Times, lost for thousands of years.
Total was the ancient Egypt capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Emperation about 400 years ago.
The place is used in the face, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Emperation, there was this great performance of the ancient art art, architecture and religion.
The eggs have always known that Turkey was forced somewhere close to the persons of the two areas that build them into the red circles here, but in some place within this huge level of health.
This area is enormous -- it is about six for four miles.
Before the Nill flows right next to Time and as it changed with the time, it took the whole city.
So how do you find a single city in a strange landscape.
So trying to find it to the short would be the equivalent to look at a needle in a passive, with the eyes and using bank grandmothers.
So we use population data from NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Niger flowers.
But you can see more democracy, and it's even more interesting -- this little area that you see within the circle here, that we think it could be the location of Timinance.
So we collaborate with the scientific scientists doing show jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say to you, it's like the shows of samples in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for human concept.
Five feet down, under a free layer of it, we found a dense of celebration objects.
This means that in this possible location of Timina, five feet down, we have a capacity of a number of years of years that give the Middle Emperation -- exactly the same period that we think is Time.
We also found work work, coral jobs and source and step -- what it shows that there was a red store.
This might seem to seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common legs used in the middle of the Middle Empire James, these are the pieces that were used.
So we have a kind of kind of concept that gives the Middle Emperation in this place.
We also have evidence of a list of list that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find Titanic here, but we'll go back to the place in a close future to do it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to capture young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discovery.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Emperation, probably was written in Turkey 400 years ago.
sharing knowledge is most of all the vaccines.
There's nothing like that on the land.
So according to it, TED wasn't founded in 1984, D.C.
You know, the ideas happened really started in 1984 to C. Chris in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high thing.
It certainly puts the search of marine contents in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close the eyes.
Imagine from standing outside, front of the door of the house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's done.
Now you can look at a group of objects in biology.
They are buying in a normal career career and they go into their particular door.
I need you to see this true.
They're supporting strong -- they're supporting, they go up a lot.
And they get up against the door of his house.
There are biologists flying around all parts of them that go on to his side, ladies of the waves that ended up in all affective places. They spend the threshold of the door.
The restaurant, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light, the light black on the Mountain of Galaxies.
It's healthy with the hand.
From his chair on a sea house.
It's a horse that I speak.
You can feel his blue blue by doing it in the nose.
You can smell the air of air and countries that are about to get in the mouth.
They go through one side and train his room to be.
It's already in the room, and I use most of his imagination, imagine Britain Salaria.
It's with a little bit of rock, dancing on his center metaphor, singing "Have Bob West Mount.
Now keep me to the kitchen.
The soil has been collected with a path of yellow cards and from the horizon.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a permanent conclusion that takes up every private in New York.
It's called the Memory of the United States.
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, waiting on, I guess this was like the end of a supermarket supercomputer.
There were several men and a few days of different ages and different habits of help.
They were measuring hundreds of alternative numbers, looking at them only one time.
They were missing the names of tens and tens of strangers.
And they were going to look at the entire poems in just minutes.
They compare to see who I could measure with greater rapid the order of a bank of nations.
And I thought, "This is incredible."
These people should be phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the computers.
This is a man called Ed Cook who had come from England and have one of the best entrepreneurs interested.
I said, "Hey, when you realize that you were a standard?
Adam said, "I'm not a site.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate from this competition say they have normal memory.
We have trained us to make these memories act of memory using a few years ago in Brazil, the same techniques that used to be criminal to measure their speech, and that the media accidents used to measure entire books.
And my reaction was, "Well." How do you have no heard of this before?
We were standing out of the room of compassion, and Ed, who is an English and brilliant English -- even though a little excited, he said, "Wood, you're an American personality.
You know Britain Salarisman:
And I said, "What?" No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britain South how to measure the order in a living band in life, in national television.
That would prove the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britain Salari, but maybe you can teach me.
Or do you have to start for something not?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not only by getting my memory, but also involved, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called E.
He's a story, very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a memory problem, it's amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic -- but it was a window that allows you to see until what our memory makes us who we are.
In the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Jim Pete. And he was based for the role of Delice Hollywood at the "Mark Man.
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Wall Latin City, member telescopes -- was center.
And when you go back to it, I read a number of treated memory about two years ago in Latin, in Antiblo and then in the Middle age.
And I learned many really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having a member of memory -- discovering and critical was not a thing as rare as you can see today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in order to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed, and I would say that they have changed us as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places in our planet in where you still find the idea of this idea of a construction memory -- depressing and critical is this competition of memory.
It's actually not so single -- there are companies like this around the world.
I was fascinated -- I wanted to know how these people.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from the University College of London invited a group of memory, the lab.
They wanted to know, to be that it has brains in some ways, structure or a different or a different demonstration of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more smart than the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest?
They gave them a construction battery battery and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory companies and the control of control of control with that they bought them.
When they put them in a magnetic resource, they picked up their brains while they were looking at numbers, faces and sense of snow colleagues. They found that in memory companies were involved from the brain, different to others.
In effect, they used -- or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space memory and nationality.
Why? Is there something we can learn about this?
The top of competitive memory is managed as a correct career where every year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the companies have to put the day.
This is my friend Ben Prison, three times of memory.
In their desk in front of him, there are three degrees of developing nations that he's about to try to measure in one hour, using a technique that he invented and just he was doing.
He used a similar technique to measure the average order of 1945, dinosaur biological biologists.
In half hours. Yeah.
And while there is a great amount of ways to remember things in these companies, absolutely all the techniques used to the end of a concept that psychologists call "The Electronic "Consumers."
It used to be supported with a paradigm called "The Baby paradigm, Brazil says the next word -- I tell two people who remember the same word -- I tell you that there's a man called Baby."
That's his application.
And then I ask you, remember that there's a Baby Baby.
And when I go back later, and I ask you realize that word I told them a mathematical?
Remember what it is?
The person who told him that his name is Baby is a little bit likely to remember the same word than the person who said their work is Baby."
The same word, different ability to remember, that's right.
What happens here?
Well, the name Bathroom, actually doesn't mean anything for you.
With all the other memories that dance for his head.
But the word, "Baby, we know panish.
They use small white seasons.
They have horrible in the hands.
They do well when they come home to work.
We probably know some paradigm.
And when we take that word for the first time, we started putting things to be able to make them easily at some point.
One of the most working techniques to do this is about 250 years ago in the ancient Great Green.
It's known like the "mind of memory."
The story says like this, there was a poem called Synester who goes to a bank.
They had hired it as a entrepreneur, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party -- it doesn't take a DNA, it was hired to a poem poll.
He was standing up, I received his memory poem and he was married, and so soon it was, the bank of the flag is collaborated.
Take them to all.
But I didn't just kill them to all, but it destroyed the bodies by giving them incredibly incredibly.
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they could not get the bodies.
A tragedy behind the other.
Similarians, standing outside, only survival, in the middle of the schools, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every invisible.
I took the families on the hand by taking them into where they were their beings wanted between the schools.
So what Synthins showed up at that moment is something that we all know more or less intelligent, and it is that without matter if we're not good to remember names or a word of phone or installation of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exciting space.
If you ask me to get the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Synesters, is very likely to do it very difficult to do it.
But I would argue that if you ask them to say who was sitting on the parallel horse of the sand in his view, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and put them from images with things that you want to remember -- the more local, wealthy, writer and associated is the image, more invisible to be.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first temperatures of memory, in late.
And how does it work?
Let's tell you that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and they want to do it, in the same way that he would have done it if they had been invited if you had invited it to TED 200 years ago.
What you might do is imagine they're on the door of his house.
And imagine some species of absolutely ridiculous image, crazy and invisible to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely inspiring competition.
And then you can imagine getting into his house, and see the Monto of the Galas moved on Mission Ed.
And that will remind you that they want to introduce his friend Ed Color.
And then you would see British South Settles to remind you that funny action that you want to tell you.
And then they went into the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk to it would be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends for them to help them remember it.
So this is how the romantic speakers were missing their speech, not word for words, which is going to connect them but typical by typical one.
In fact, the typical term comes from the grade "good, which means "place."
It's a research of when people thought about the orbit and the return with this kind of space terms.
The phrase in the first place, it would be like the first place in their memory paradigm.
I saw this was just fascinating -- and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory, and I had the idea of writing something strange about this computer of competitive memory.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory of memory is a particularly boring event.
So seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on taking examples. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone goes on the front of it.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in these people, but I don't have access to me.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in their place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem -- or the names of an old school animal bought in a public market.
And I discovered that this was incredibly interested.
You would have expected it to be.
It was entrepreneur, because it wasn't just trying to train memory.
What is actually about doing is better more and more and more than the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images -- common, public and strangers and underground and underground and underground street, in the eye of the mind.
I was very happy with this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory.
It's a couple of ears and a few set of safety conflicts with five needles, because distribution is the worst enemy of a memory company.
I ended back back to the same conclusion that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could increase, in a kind of particular experiment.
I thought this could serve a good school for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the context, something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to measure democracy, and phone numbers and phone lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just training trains. Tracks that work.
Because they're based in pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it is not necessary that you get to build the memory of memory or memory boards to benefit with a little bit of perspective about how their mind.
We actually talk about people with a big memory as if you try to be a blood dollar, but it's not the case.
The big memories are education.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we focus deep on.
The paradigm of memory, these memory techniques are just streets.
In fact, they're not even streets of truth.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them don't end up in there.
But the reality is that there are no attacks.
This is how things do memories.
And if there is something that I want to leave you today, is what E, the financial that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our resources.
How many are we willing to lose from what our short existence is going to be lost in the Blacks or iPhones, not paying attention to being human to us, who walk on our side, and we will be so holestrate that we don't even get us to process in production?
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capacity in all of us.
But if you want to live a memory life, you should be from the kind of person that I remember to remember it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we will get just a complex place, New Remers.
Because 30 years ago, I am from No. Reputa, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called Lingo, and this was my child dominant.
In the corner from my dominant, I was the boat that share with my sister.
And between my dominant and the boat, there was a block that gave the room to be.
And there all of them spent the street looking at the television. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, they all looked at me, and every time I went back and go back in a tail, all of me.
And I was like this.
It was total, it was inspirating and I hate it.
I hate that record, I hate that bank, I had that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Like it.
Those feelings that I feel -- that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or artists of the signals, but of those virtual connections that we feel in places that we continue.
And it's not to extract that we sit in that way, because according to the environmental protection of environmental protection --  Americans spend 90 percent of his time under the roof.
Or, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded from architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize us.
That makes us a little bit income and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you explore them, think about power, "Strangerous and democracy?
And I know that you think about it as a building in a building built 250 years ago by the grandmothers.
This is a trick.
It's a distribution that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a lot of time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build home.
Look at this, these stable solutions, flowers in front of the elements.
This is very, very useful because building things is artificial.
It's cost, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who build the business and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use ways that you know they're going to work.
So we found it with buildings like this.
It's a great building.
It's the Public Bublin of Lingo who ended up in 2009, in my national city, and you know, has a color, it has this record thing, colors, ride ride, red ride, red ride, which is going to be trying to communicate with this building, the kids, the property values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2009, on the other side of the country, he ended up another library that looks like this.
It's in Setting.
This library shows how we use the media media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to get up, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both disabilities are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the power.
On one side is innovation -- the architects that constantly put new technologies, new techniques, new solutions.
We start, we put up and we put so much, that we get completely out of people.
All of the black -- this is dependent. You think we feel very good, but we're dead in because we don't have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols approaching.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like traditions, so we started to experience the back of the back, over and over again. We have done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, we went out of the 1970s.
The architects were connected with the said "Building."
It has to do with the ants.
That can be advertising.
small windows in humanity scale.
Something really hard.
So we go back to the '80s, and we started to break those symbols together.
We put the power back in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that we like and active them.
We add and we add patterns and we use new materials.
They love them.
We don't give attention.
We take Chinese arms and we turn them into cards, which can be massive markets of glass.
The forms were based, they won in Africa and color.
The oceans became colors.
Cities grew up to the size of buildings.
A crazy.
But they were the 80s, that was great.
We all spend the mouse in commercial centers -- we moved to the barriers, and there, in surgery, we can create our own architectural factors.
Those factors could be to medicine, the French or the Titanian.
Probably with a signal of bread papers.
This is what happens with population.
This is what happens with the symbols on it.
They're easy, they are bars, because instead of creating new spaces, we remember memories of other places.
I know very good, and you all know, this is not the Tourist.
This is Holly.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the power back in the other direction.
In the 1980s, and at the early '90s, we started to experience with the discovering single distribution.
We discovered the historical symbols -- now we tell new technical design techniques in computer, and we found new companies, a few ways that are stars against other ways.
This is accident and framework, and it's a picture of important? You have totally except.
Normally, the climbing power in the opposite direction.
But then something amazing happened.
In 1999, it was invited this building.
This is Biological Gigland, from Frank George.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Golden said that Bill was one of those rich moments when critical and public and public and public and public and public and public and public in general, they were completely about a building.
The New York Times captured this military building.
The turn in Bill came up in 250 percent when they ended up the building.
So suddenly everybody wanted one of those buildings, the Angeles, Steen, China, New York, Clinton, Spanian.
Everybody wanted one, and George was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these ways, wild and radical and radical and radical and radical and radical and radical and really become posters around the world?
And he happened, because the media became all around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and traditions.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing they did the main classrooms in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these ways, they had culture and traditions.
This phenomenon of beginning of the new military happened with other star architecture.
He went to Japan and Liberaton, and what happened with these few light architects in the threshold of the new military -- actually started going through all the architecture -- the digital media started to increase the speed of information.
You think, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transportation is accepted, you can take a boat, an airplane can be tricks.
The acceptable technology, you can see in the personality, and at the end, and at the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building becomes beyond their physical location.
architecture is everywhere. That means that the speed of communities finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before I know if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
British wasn't a two years old, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much they stopped them.
That's never going to happen to happen, I think, because we're in the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture since the invention of the ant -- the steel or the application, and it's the revolution of the media.
My theory is that when you apply the power to the media media -- it starts to hide every time faster, until it starts to be in both extremes almost in simulation, and it is actually building the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost institutionally, with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up.
We were hired to support this building that was invented.
This is the center of a village called Piest Islamic in the state of New York.
It's a community community.
But that meant that two years before it was finished by the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the end product -- there were no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started coming and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, because these are not just images of a building, because these are not only images of a building, they're the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes corruptions with collective memory, and when you charge these symbols -- we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those biologists of Linguide.
If that building is built today, first we're going to go to the Internet in search of new biologists."
We would be bombs with examples of experience, of innovation, about what it can be a biological.
That's moving.
Musicians that can lead to the mayor of Lingoons, people in Lingo, and tell you that there's no unique answer to what it can be a library today.
We're part of this.
This ability of solutions gives the freedom of experiment.
It's all different now.
Artists are already not those mysterious creatures that use working words and complicated drugs, and one is no longer a developing public who doesn't accept something that you haven't seen before.
And the architects can listen to you, and you don't leave the architecture.
That means that the electric power of one star to another, from a movement to another, is amazing.
In fact, we can go ahead and find some right solutions to the problems that the society.
This is the end of the story of architecture, and it means that the buildings of the morning will be very different to buildings today.
This means that a public space in the old city of Sevente can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a state in Brooklyn, it can be that, a state in Brookly, and not a bad historical imagination of red ride with the idea of what it should be a state.
This means that a few robots can build our buildings, because we're finally going to be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are shown to the capabilities of nature and not the control.
This means that a statement of parking in Microsoft Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do something or for me, or even you can marry in the night.
This means that three architects can be able to be born in the West Vivid in New York City, and to remember half a million dollars of the community in the end of that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little bank of least, so muscle and free as the animals that are going to look at.
Because it doesn't matter if it's a cow or a robot who built our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build it, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more ecological buildings, more intelligent and more threatened.
We've been hoping that all of you want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
They find an architect, put it and we work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most small spaces, the local biologists, the homes where we form our children, and the step of the Ph.D.
Thank you very much.
This is my subject, State.
I just got a year and he started walking up.
And it makes it in that great, typical way of the kids in a year, taking them, as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally powerful.
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really love their report.
It goes and child, and it gives themselves those big and high beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Basically, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, when about doing this?
How is we suddenly not like our approach?
Because, especially we don't like it.
Every month, 10 people look for Google, "I'm failure."
This is Fah, it's 13 years old, and it lives in Dender.
And as any teenager, it just wants to be wrong and go down.
It's dominant at night.
It's prepared for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little conference because, despite your mom tells him all the mouse that is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it is faith.
So between what his mom tells him and what their friends or companies of school, they say, doesn't know who to believe who to believe who to believe it.
So it makes a video of it, he published it in YouTube, and I ask others to please leave a company, "I'm good or I'm faith."
Well now, Facebook has received over 13 companies.
Some of these are so distributed, that it doesn't even deserve it to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenage that gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
thousands of people are published like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They are under the pressure of being in line and available all the time, talking to me, by standing, giving me like, sharing, by sharing -- sharing, published, this never ended up.
We have never been so connected to have been so connected -- in the way, so young way.
As a mother said, "It's like there is a party in his fourth every night.
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that are on the hand with that are impossible.
This environment, to be always connected to our children to take up in the number of "I like they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no diversity between a life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is manipulating dimensional.
What is the most destroyed thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are killed from the news of the girls now.
Bear models follow our passengers.
The technical technique is now a robot.
And trends like Asia, Hollywood, Billia and Audience.
For those who describe it, the public means property.
These trends are associated from women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what the young people.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the super-seat stars of the department, and the stories stores.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we just want our children to create healthy and be good individuals wrong.
But in an obsessed culture in the image, we are teaching our children to develop more time and mental effort to their approach, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and their studies and other aspects start to suffer to it.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think you don't see the big enough.
These are not traditional activity.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as contributions to society and the field of the lab development.
32 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the kinds of classrooms. They avoid to participate in the blue debate because they don't want to call attention for their physical species.
One of five are not looking at classes in absolute during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the temperature of example, if you don't think you see that you see the enough thing, specifically if you don't believe that you are enough enough enough, you get a less note to the average of your companies who don't worry about that of the approach.
And this phenomenon has generated in Financy, the United States and China.
And it gets independent from what these young people.
So, so that it is good of course, we're talking about how you see you -- not how you are really true.
The low atmosphere on their body is deployed the academic performance.
And it's also putting the health.
The teenagers with a little bit less physical activity -- they eat less fragility and video versions, they are involved in more different distants that can take them to a food development.
They have low attention.
They are more easily influenced by the people who surround them and are in greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all over this because of what they take more artificial decisions like the control of analysis and drugs, distances distributed, aesthetic relationships to early ages and without protection and an analyside day.
The search of the perfect body is presenting to the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe that they have support again, independent from if you have or they don't have greater strangers of an environment.
18 percent of women don't present to a work interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity.
Living this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about it, it doesn't take you very far.
Not except.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms -- the first is that we have to include trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their atmosphere.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many of a lot of programs really interesting, without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact but also a dead impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused in six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are very critical parts for any willing to draw an education in body autism that works.
An education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us that we take the risks in the issue and we're a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
And by designing the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you the opportunity of our politicians in hair corals or the size of their feet, or to inspire that the democracy or the success of a Olympic attack depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start playing people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you put a way?
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to change really our culture, so our children are growing all their person, to make the individual violence, the diversity -- influence.
We have to put people who are really killing the difference in a performance.
To make a difference in the real world, we do that they are the ones who go out in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world in where our children are free to become the best version of them, where the way they think you see you never have to see them to be who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
Do you hope?
Is your sister?
Her daughter?
Is it supporting your friend?
It could be just the woman who is to two seats of distance -- what does it mean for her if it was free from that critical voice in their inner hand, which is going to be absolutely showing you to have long legs -- more delivered, a more planet, feet more smaller, feet more smaller, feet.
What does it mean for her if we overcome this and we would say, rise to their potential that way?
Now, the obsession of our culture with images is getting up to everyone.
But let's teach our kids the truth.
We teach you that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and why they do, and because they make us feel.
We include the atmosphere in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compared with other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little tissues of a year of today, they become certain change agents of themselves.
Let's do it.
The age of Navilan 1990, a lady called Sharch South South South American walked into a hotel in Manhattan and attack to the Arab Medice Kala, the leader of the London Department.
I'm going to go up in the income in the income of it, but being present by other certain cars, in company of others, they started planning attacks to about 12 people in New York, including tenerations, synthesis and the United Nations sense.
Fortunately, those planets were frustrated by an infrastructure of the FBI information.
Traditionally, the 1990s was in the World Trade Center -- you couldn't avoid it.
More than North Movember would be convicted by their participation in that attention.
Shellow is my father.
I was born in Philadelphia, Pennagen, in 1989, being an engineering engineer, with an American mother, with an American mother -- between the two did all the possible thing to give me a happy child.
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of the Islam -- that very few even most of the Muslims are going to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact -- it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a little fraction of people who are going to be so curious to their conversations that think that you have to use all the possible media for everyone to live like them.
A few months before I sat up with me and explained to me that in the last end of week, he and some friends, had been going to train training in Long Island to practice.
He told me I would go with him the next day.
We came to the tone of the tablet California that, without knowing our group, was linked by the FBI of the FBI
When I got to take up, my father helped me to support the risk in the man and explained to me how to take the goal to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last battle that would shoot it to the small light light on the goal and, for surprise of all of all, especially me, all the goal of the goal in calls.
My uncle went back to the other and in Radio, he said "The Babby.
In a father, such a child.
All of all, the computer produced a lot of red -- but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted by putting a course with 700 pounds of experts in the North Trade station of the North Trade Contract Content, causing an exhibition that killed six people and did to other dollars.
I loved those men.
I called them "Mark, which means you.
When I was 19, I had been moved 20 times. That influence during my child didn't allow me to make a lot of microscopes.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to start and go to another city.
And as I was always the new face of the class that was mathematically victim.
I was considered my identity to avoid to be the white -- but it will be the new class of class, silence and recording, it was enough music.
So most of the time the time happened in home reading books, watching TV or playing games.
So for these reasons I didn't develop social skills to say it sure. To grow under factors, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was forced to play people to play people, with the basis in artificial industries, like their race or their religion.
So how could I open your eyes.
One of the first experiences that they put up my way to think about it was during the president choices of 2000.
In a professional program in which it was involved in the National National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of flying violence -- like I had been value of math almost my life, was something that felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different properties.
One day, to the end of the conversation, I discovered that one of the kids who had done friends, was July.
I took several days to go to light this detail and realized that there was no animal between the two.
Never before I had had a Jewish friend and frankly, I felt very proud of having been able to see the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was infinite.
Another critical moment came up when I got a summer work in Burn Garden, a park of fun.
I found with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience turned fundamental in the development of my career.
All of life had taught me that the hospital was a fish and by extraordinary, all the hospitals were bad influence.
In fact, I had the opportunity to work with honest actors there, in a stage, and I could see that several of them were the most amazing and less critical that I had seen in life.
And having been adapted by a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat young people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be trained.
For that feeling I could control the stars that had taught me from kids, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be honor -- but I know what it is to be played by something beyond my control.
Then he came the "Dama Shakeshark."
All night, John State made me incredibly honest to my intelligence, and he helped me see that the root of people, religion or sexual organization, they don't have anything to do with care.
In a lot of ways he became my pattern in a moment where I was determined to need it.
In fact, inspiration can come from the incredible, and that a Jewish community would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, extraordinary parent, it was not in blood.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I will consider in my heart for always while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough to increase dominant and said, "I'm tired of doing."
At that time, I realized how much negative energy needs to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not Garba Eric.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decide to go out and put it in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone -- some day, who is trying to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- that even though I was told to this violent information and intelligent, I wasn't going to make me fantastic.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight the terrorism and against the profits.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their beautiful beings, by the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts without sense, as I react to the actions of my father.
And with this simple thing to me here as a test that violence is not international to any religion or race -- that children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this time there's a film that is project in their minds.
It's an amazing multiple film.
It's in 3D and it has a surface sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a short, being and texture and texture.
You feel your body, your dollar, your man, your plan.
It has emotions, energy and happiness.
It has memories like moments of your childhood that are project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a super-seat voice in your sense of conscious thinking.
The heart of film is you who experience everything in right.
This film is your confidence of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
consciousness is one of the fundamental truth of the existence of being human.
Each of us is aware of it.
We all have an internal movie -- you, you and you.
There's nothing that we know more directly.
At least I know I have a own consciousness.
I don't have cancer that you are aware of.
consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware -- nothing in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we consciousness?
Why do we have these international movies.
Why are we not just robots that we have to produce what we got to produce results without experience the international film.
At this time, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
science, by nature, is goal.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, they prefer that vision.
The psychology was studying the behavior obviously, the neuroscience studied the brain obviously but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then 20 years ago, everything started to change.
Neuroscientists like French Crazy and physicists like Robotic Pennic said, "It's now the moment for science to get the consciousness.
And since then, there was a real explanation of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness science in the recent years was the search of corrections, correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something from this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nana Kangaria a few minutes.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science science.
It's not a science of experiences.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience represents some questions that we want to explain the consciousness -- the questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are completely.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No energy to technologies.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, I don't appreciate the real central mystery of this material, why is all physical process in the brain has to be addressed by consciousness?
Why is there a subjective printed film.
At this time, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to nature.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like the books, like humanities, like life, and we're going to find experience.
The typical corrections are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how they operate the mouse, how the humans work, how the humans work -- how they are applied, and they are adapting and metabolism the living organisms -- all of them are questions about objective work.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon -- how we walk on, how we talk about, how do we play a head -- they're all questions about behavior.
But when it's about consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it is that all behavior is accounted from a substance experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the profession, the standard paradigm of neuroscience actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a heart scientific material.
I want a scientific theory of the floating that works. For a long time, I would put your head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for synthetic reasons.
I think we are going to be in this point.
We have a wonderful explanation, great. We used to this -- physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, the biology explains a part of the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this stage.
On one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to take that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now, is a kind of animal, something that we need to interact to our vision of the world, but we don't know still how on.
With an analogy like this, you can need radical ideas -- I think we need ideas that at the beginning seem local, before I can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennes, which is here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no very difficult problem of consciousness.
All of the idea of the internal subject film includes a kind of illusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the objective functions -- the brains of the brain, and this is how everything you need exploration.
Well, more power for him.
That is the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of the consciousness of consciousness in the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many other others, that vision is pretty close to simply negotiate that the observation of consciousness is appropriate.
But I go in a different direction.
In time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be propositive.
The first line is that consciousness is fundamental.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental flags, space and time and the mass.
They put fundamental laws that governments -- like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic in terms of it.
At the contrary, they consider fundamental, and there is the world.
Sometimes the list.
In the 19th century, Mars discovered that you can't explain the electronic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of presentative concepts -- space, time, land, land, land -- the basic laws of electronics, and I put the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those grades government.
I think that's the situation that we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain the consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, market, then by the question of logic -- you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be to put consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental law of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not about science.
It opens up the way to make it science.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that government consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space -- the space, the mass, physical process.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can be able to estimate it in a remover.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can be able to estimate it in a camera.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called a professor, "Pack for all of all, "Particular -- every system is conscious -- not only humans, the microscopes, the microscopes, the microscopes, even the microscopes of Robert King, the electricity particles.
Even a picture has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that pictures are smart or you think.
It's not that a picture can be full of animal when you think "A, always traveling to the speed of light.
I can never choose and smell the risks."
No, so no.
But the thinking is that maybe pictures can have some electricity sense of critical feeling -- subject, some primary budget of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do anyone think about something so local.
In part of this comes from the first idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as the space, time and mass -- it's natural to assume that it can also be universal as the others.
It's also worth to notice that even though the idea seems electrically, it's a lot less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continent with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that maybe the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that relate to the thinking with the physical process, is visiting consciousness with information.
You always have an information, there's consciousness.
complex information, like in a human being, complex consciousness.
simple information, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuron -- Gilla Tonic, took this kind of theory and developed development with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information of information, which is called piece, which means the degree of integrated information in a system.
And I guess he has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information of information, a degree high piece, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a lot of an interaction of information of information, just quite meaningful -- very significant consciousness.
But when you get to the behaviors, microbes -- parallel, the piece of peace said.
The level of information is less, but it's not zero either.
In Tony theory, there will still be a different consciousness level.
In fact, a fundamental law of consciousness, high piece of piece, high content of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that the application can help us interact the consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and the phones with frequency have seen that physics is curious attractive.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations -- but we don't talk about the reality that goes down.
As Steven Halfin, where does the fire of the equations?
From the paradigm of the physical vision of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision -- consciousness is the one that puts up in the emotions.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of addition.
It's there in the center.
This vision, I think, the Papen vision, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and very serious things.
Some can be incredible.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then it should be vertical.
If you're a parking and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of man.
I think that you think about it, it tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences is not so much the fact of consciousness, but their importance and their complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What's about the artificial intelligence system in the movie "Shore."
Is it consciousness?
According to the vision of the Papentine information, she has a complicated information process, so that the answer is yes, if it's aware of it.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problems about the kind of developing systems of smart computers and the kind of taken them.
Finally, you can ask by the awareness of complex colleagues, the planet.
Does it have their own concept?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED talk -- at this moment we have a TED collective concept, an internal movie for this full TED group of the international movies of each of the parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this paradigm view is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second is universal.
The vision is a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those thoughts of thinking to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right way to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it from night to the morning.
But I think we finally go to discover it.
To understand consciousness is the real class, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile -- a low education.
I went to school, I took my friends with my friends, I was stuck with my less.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to name for a printer of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a obvious problem.
She has actually not got anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good news. After school, I had a piece of paradigm on my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the services "Free the Salar Salar and "The "Telescope The "The Salaria and "The "Telescopes."
Yes, I know. What control.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a collection if we took discussion outside the equation.
years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the side 11 of the Jewish studies a little bit of the human studies a half and said, "Hey, when you give your despair?
And I said, "What's despairent."
Well, I had been talking about the law law for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your emotional speech.
When people in the walls are talking about institutional things in school?
"The general of the cars?
And it was then when I realized -- this kid had had experiences with people with disability as an objective objects.
And we are not. And it's not collaboration of the male, it is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manufacturing.
We're not real people. We're there.
And in fact, I'm in this stage like what I do in this side of wheels, and probably you are waiting to inspire them -- right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to give you strange.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that they have mentioned in relationship to discussion.
Yes, you have sold the mind that disability is something bad, to male, Mayor machine.
It's something bad and living with a disability you make you excited.
It's not bad and I can't make it exciting.
And in the last few years, we've been able to provide even more this message through social communication.
It's possible to see images like this, "The only disability in life is a bad activity.
Or this other one, "The except is inventionally."
Or this other one, before I was going to go on, interviewed."
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It can be that you have seen one of the girl without hands drawing with a super supply of the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with analysis organized legs of carbon fire.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call the body research.
And I use the term of the declaring term, because they make a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we change the depressions in benefit of people without discovery.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, so we can see them and think, "Well, so bad that it was my life, could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person.
I've lost the number of the number of times that have taken me strange to express that you think I'm worth or a source source and this happens before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I'm happy to get up the morning and remember my own name --  And this is confusing.
These images, those images can make people with disability of people without discovery.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a discovering person is actually something difficult.
We knew some things.
But the things that we know is not the things that you can think.
They're not religious things to our bodies.
I use the term "Personality, depressing because I was written by called the social model of discussion, which tells us that we're more discovering because of society where we live that because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of their ability to like you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside of it.
They are just using their bodies getting the best of their ability to get the best of their capacity.
So is it really fair to build them in the way we do it, when you share those images.
When people say, "You're a source of instrumentation, it tells it as a computer.
And I know why happens.
It's about the mind, because they have sold this sense that disability makes us excited.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what they're thinking.
I am here boundaries the inspiration and you think about God, Steve, you are not sometimes inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
Learning from other people with disability at all.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
I learn that this is a great idea to use a little bit of boat pieces to collect the things that come to me --  learning the infrastructure of how to charge the mobile phone battery on the battery of the chair.
General.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagrams, but against a world that excepts and construction us.
I really believe that that mind that has sold us about disability is the biggest intelligence.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote -- "The only disability in life is a bad activity, the reason that that is to mind is not true, because of the social model of discovery.
A lot of sounds in the top of the scale has never done that it becomes a broken.
Never --   So Sanda before a television screen will not make the substances for the right people.
Not a lot of people in a half of people in the middle of a book and increasing a positive attitude to turn all those books to the brand.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but normal.
I want to live where a 15 years old, sitting in his family watching "Bulfin Salar The Salar Salar is not considered from nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are happy to get rid of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the general access of people with discovery, and I want to live in a world where a year of 11 degrees in a high school school is not a little surprising that your new teacher is a subject of steps.
The disability doesn't make us excited, but to question what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at reality and professional file, with the empathy?
And what is the average speed of a glass without career.
Unfortunately, today I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't stop it.
When people think of reality, I think of "Minister Reputs and in Tom Crison where the hands in the air, but the reality is not science science.
The actual reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and the mobile phones.
So how do we get to the real reality?
The first step is what I take put -- the Google Gallers.
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google Gallers are a device that allows you to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional sports in the field.
Now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will get with their imagination.
We can use the Google Gallers, under a card and knowing what is to run through the game field to 100 miles -- the blood blocks the eyes.
We can know that it feels like a man from 100 pounds person, trying to deal with all of your being.
I have been there and I assure you that it's nothing right.
I bring some videos to show you what's using Google Gales under the road, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of the principles of NASA, because the idea of the NEOs of emerging technology is a submert coming up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris Global Christmas."
It's horrible to be taken.
A moment. You take a little bit.
Proventons, prepared?
Let's go.
Chris Whiters." As you can see, it's a probability of what it is to be to be taken in the football field, from the perspective of the talk.
You would have realized that they have people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, correct from the University of Washington.
Marketing March, Mars 44, Man 44.
Litera eight, Alama Either, Good."
Chris Global -- this is a little bit more to the feeling to be in the field, but it doesn't have anything to do with being in the NASA.
They want that experience.
They want to be in the field, it will be their favorite players, and they have asked me in YouTube and Twitter, you can see from the angle of a field market.
Or a correct?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Gallers, how do we get out of flag? How do we take it to the next level.
We took it to that level using something called Ecology Richard, which just many of you know.
The Rich Ecology has been described as the most real virtual reality of virtual reality ever created, and it's not bad bar.
And I'm going to show you why.
Man: Oh, oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow player?
Oh, God.
CA: That is the experience of a man in a mountain room taking for their life.
What will be the experience of a face when we get a video of Arabic Percent by creating the line, getting out of a talk with the arm before I cut and make an antibiotics? What will be the experience of a face.
When can I be Message running on the road, leaving the bank at the bottom of the network, or Forth making a shape in Michael."
What is their experience when I wake out of a mountain over 100 miles like a specific service?
Maybe you increase the sales of papers for adults.
But this is not yet really unfortunately.
It's just virtual reality, Richard.
How do we take the reality really, RO: Right?
We're going to take the reality of the reality when the interviews, the mountains and the dreams see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win particular."
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give you money.
So here's a brief representation about technology in the News.
In 1998, the Particles of Balifica put a mission to his field market to play faster.
They won the Supermark Bolt that year.
Other teams decided to imagine them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting.
In 1999, the NASA put radio in the streets of the field of field and after the definitions.
They had more specialists because it was faster, more entered.
In 2008, imagine that they're a player coming back to their group and see his next player showed in front of you, in a plastic vision that you take person. You won't have to worry about forget a play.
Or to measure strategy.
They just go back to the field and record.
And the instruments want it because if you don't follow their institutions, they lose particular, and they hate to lose particular.
If you lose them for you as a service.
And they don't want that.
But the actual reality is not just a better stranger man.
The reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the part.
How would it do?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera in every corner of the state having a view from how much people are down.
You also get information from the seats and the applications, something that is already working.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will be able to send it.
The bad ones will have information.
This makes the good teams of the bad.
So your computer team will be as important as your resources, and the data analysis will stop being just for neurons.
It will be also for sports. Who would have imagined.
How would it be in the field.
Imagine that they're the field of field.
You get the whales and retreats.
You look for an open record -- all of a sudden, a flame on the left part of your visual saving you that a defense behind you is going to attack you, normally, not you see it, but the RI system is saying.
You get to the protection area.
Another flat is that there's an open record.
You launched the bank, but they were depressed.
And the bank loses the transportation.
You don't know where to laugh. However, the record sees in his view an area of ice that is electroded, and it can make the career.
It's able to be applied, and it goes up and angle.
The audience, and the faces have followed the player from each night.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the part.
To make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
They want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite play.
The reality will be part of the sports because it's too recording to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this is the only use of the reality of reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circuit, like our strange entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the reality to feed the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for sports depression.
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a base whose days are their actions from the perspective of victim?
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia.
How much is it going to be a Company Chicago or a New Democrats Testers trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of terrible notes and Karages."
Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is going on.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face -- you know, as always of us.
Thank you.
I recently flew me after 23 years of service in the Higgs Pacific Park.
Most of those 23 years I spent the end of the same side of the Marine context, which includes the Gold Gate.
The bridge is a cognitive structure, known by their beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also an image for substance, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Gold Gates was open in 1970.
John Strates, engineering boss of building the bridge -- he said that, "The bridge is particularly to test substances.
The subject from the bridge is not protecting or probably?
But from their open, over 1,000 people have saved his death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two days to bring them to another dimension -- this bridge has been involved as such as that, as the every one from him is released from all your propositions and pain, and the water that happens underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make subject.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body comes against the water about 120 miles per hour.
The impact breaks the bones -- some of which performance organs very present.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones who don't normally take up in the infection water, and then they get up.
I don't think that the ones who have this method of surface is to tell the death of death that they will face.
This is the cable.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 pieces of oil step to the bridge.
This is where most people are going to be in order to take the life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is in that edge, and at its most dark moment, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young young man talked to an official office their life.
I want to tell you that we had success that day to bring it back on the balloon.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any form training training.
We went up to channel the way through these so-called calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who have the surface, but the office as well.
We've collected a long way since then.
Today, young offices and psychologists train the new office.
This is James Garby.
I met this last year of Julia in the past year when you get a call of a possible subject in the cord near the center.
I said, and when I came in, I looked at James talking to an office of the Gold Gate.
James had only 32 years old, and he had flew up here from New Reserves.
In fact, I had flew up to here two times before New Remers to try to fight from this bridge.
After about one hour talking to James -- we asked us if we met the story of Park box.
Remember the Greek mathematician, Genes created Parkin, and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You never open that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Park, and she opened the box.
And she came out of plants, the planes, and all sorts of bad against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So James said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no hope?
He was sent into the right, it turned on the right, and it was.
This kind of yellow and smart of New Jersey was just going to take the life.
I talked to the parents of James that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be holding very well, because the next day, the brain of family called me to see how it was.
The Japanese parents had asked it.
The solar days of the surface affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions, what would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved out of surface?
What would you say?
Do you know what to say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk about, but you have to hear it.
I'll hear to understand.
Not democracy, colleagues, or tell the person you know how to feel like, because you probably don't know.
It's just there, you can be the point of influence that they need.
If you think someone is surface, you don't have fear of face and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: "Oh you in simulations have thought of ended up their life, you've had these thoughts?
You can go to the person in front of it can save the life and be the point of influence for them.
Other signs to look for it, hope, to believe that things are terrible and you're never going to better, impossible, believe that there is nothing you can do about it, the recent social -- and a lost of the interest in life.
I got this talk about just a couple of days ago, and I got an email of a lady and I'd like to read her his letter.
She lost his son at the age of this year, and I wrote this empathy just a couple of days ago, and it's with their permission and benefit that I read them.
"Hey, Kenya. I imagine you're in the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this end of week.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty interesting, but not more moments to realize that Mike will not come home.
Michael was driving from Peter to San Francisco to see the 49 percent with his father the 99 percent of energy.
I never got there.
I called the Politic police and I promised it as a disability that night.
At the next morning, two office came to my house, and they introduced me that Michael car was down in the bridge.
A text had seen it out from the bridge to the 1970s, in the previous day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be totally too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been going to have been a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My organizations are with you for your struggle.
The GPS Pole Panthologis is supposed to be a landscape through our beautiful neighborhood, not a certain.
Good like this week, Vichard."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and collect the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
The age of March 2000, I responded to a radio call for a possible subject of surface on the top of the north to the north to the north tour.
I took my engine on the steel and looked at this man, Kevin Berrie, on the top.
When I looked at me, I grew out of immediately the balloon, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the ground.
For the hour and the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about their depression and hope.
Kevin decided for her account that day to go back on that career and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, it happy.
This is a new beginning, a new life.
But I asked him, "What was it that he did you go back and give hope and life another opportunity?
And do you know what I told me?
He said, "I hear you.
I let me talk and just listen to you.
Shortly after that income, I got a letter of the mother of Kenya, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to read it.
"I want Mr. Brondon, nothing will run the events of the 11 of the street, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Similarly, I think Kevin was called by help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental disease for which it has been really medical.
I took Kevin when I only had six months, completely conscious of all those heroing raises, but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order as the say.
We give God for you.
Similar with you, Karry Berring."
And at the end she wrote, DP: When I visited the General hospital of San Francisco that night, you signed like the patient.
"You know, I had to solve it.
Today, Kevin is a happy father and active memory of society.
I'm talking about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspired others.
Super is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is supposed to come.
That act, despite the end of their own pain, I stole the opportunity to meet it.
This is what the subject does.
For most of the surface people, or those who consider the surface, they wouldn't think about taking another person.
They just want their own pain up.
By the general thing -- this is just three ways, showing, drugs or the doctor or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and called the subject around the bridge.
From those incentives that I've been directly involved -- I've just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was James.
The other was a man who talked about a hour.
For that time, I was written in three ways.
In the end of the end, I looked at me, and he said, "Government, I'm sorry, but I have to go.
And he went out.
Horrible, absolutely remarkable.
I want to tell you, though, that most of the people that we get to focus on that bridge don't be surprised.
Also, those few people who have gone out of the bridge and life and you can talk about it, that one or two, most of those people have said that the second one that left the book was realized that they had made a mistake.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect Mars with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be able to do for doing.
The surface can prevent you.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not like, but in your interest you know what you are, and a question makes you, how do you become that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone.
When I became the model I felt that I had finally made the dream that had had from girls.
My outside of my end finally connected with my inner truth, with my inside.
For complicated reasons, which I'm going to give up later, when I look at this picture I think, "Well, you get it, you get it up.
But the ocean occurred, I discovered that, I am starting on.
We all have our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of the liberal window, to get rid of the limitations in the skin of skin or by the beliefs of those who steal us.
They are people who always challenge the status which, which is considered accessible.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my angels even ignore my story.
I think this environment is called revolution.
This is me.
And I was recorded as a boy by born because of my general approach.
I remember my five years in the Files, in my house, I always took this road in the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take that road in the head.
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl."
I knew how to accept it.
The gender has always considered a microbial fact -- but now we know that, actually, it's something more complex and missing.
Because of my success, I never tried to share my story, not because I would think that I'm bad but how the world comes to those of us who want to release them.
Every single day to be a woman.
I have my mom -- my dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so fundamental.
There's a long tradition in the public culture that celebrate the mystery of the gender.
There's a diagnose diagnose of compassion.
There is a hundred hell, dialogue from the diagnoses.
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Fiberians who celebrate these minutes.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something would get me, this is the kind of woman that I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still see of man, I met this woman called TED.
It's the director of a beauty of beauty transportation.
That night she said, "Why haven't you been involved in the conservation of beauty?
He told me that if it was involved from the research and the version of the research and the visual, and that night, they won in a white suit and it was a third end of galaxy and he was third financial between over 40 songs.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that his first work was from beautiful women of transportation, but I know.
I also met the daughter of the devices, especially when we travel to the remote providers of the Fiberians.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2008, my mom who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that they were able to take my support of the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was responded.
I said to my mother, "Man, I am fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty of beauty.
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you moved to the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of generation."
It was all I needed to listen.
My mom suggested me to put two to my name.
She also hit me when I was operating in Taliban at the age of 11 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Taliban actually make the most predictable surgery, sophisticated and safe.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before changing the name and the gender.
So in 2009, I went to San Francisco, and I remember to look at the condition of conditions with the name Gene and the film of female gender.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity of identity means to be able to drive or power to get a transport, but for me it was the lesson to live, to feel digital.
Suddenly, my fears were minimalized.
I felt that I could take my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so fundamental.
I think of this woman of Allow Network News.
A young woman from New York who actually lived their truth, but that, represented, put their life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our subject rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of the novel we do a global glass for the Construction of Treating.
I'm in this stage thanks to a long story of people who put and put up to the instrument.
These are Mars Pite. John and Shellow Vivid.
Today, at this same time, I'm coming out of the arm.
I can't follow my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help others live their truth without amazing, or fear.
I am here, experimental, so that some day there is no longer more surveillance from 20 of Noney.
My deeper truth took me to accept what I am.
Would you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  KT: Garreline, George Supermarket."
George Rocket" -- of course, you see, first of all, thank you all my biologists.
My past network, my parents especially to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been able to have young women in the training and I had forced, and some times, when they called me and told me that their parents could not accept it. I was called my mom and said, "Mom can you call this woman?
Sometimes it works, other -- it's just an identity of gender -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us get a generation in the cloud, and what I try to do is put on the table that some of the time that some times that antibiotic attention -- and that there should be a space that allows people to accept it, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The growing movement is starting compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work for doing.
I should have understood it.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my additions.
KS: Thank you. Thank you. GG: Thank you.
In many patterns and trial societies, the parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who know about her daughter and I'm proud of it.
Mall started his campaign for education depending up their rights in 2008, and when they moved up their efforts in 2011, when you get it very famous -- a very famous girl, a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of infrastructure, of the infinition, of violence and exploration.
You see, in the pattern societies, right from the beginning, when you notice a girl, your birth doesn't celebrate it.
It's not generalized, not for your father or for his mother.
The neighborhood comes up to the mother and no one happiness to the father.
And a mother is advertised by having a girl.
When it gives light to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets strong.
When it gives light to the second daughter, it becomes connected, and with the hope of a son, when you get his third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother, but the daughter -- the daughter is born -- when it comes up, it sounds as well.
At the age of five years, when you should go to school, it goes home and school addition to their sisters.
Until the age of 12 years, in some way, has a good life.
You can fun.
It can play with their friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a market.
But when you go into the activity, when it was about 13 years old, he was ready to go out of his house without a male approach.
It's connected to the four walls of his house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and their brothers and his family and their family and if you bring the code of that subject hospital, it could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this kind of honor code, not only affect the life of a lot, also affect the life of male members of family.
So this brother, it sacrifice the joy of their life and the happiness of their brothers in name of the honor.
And there is a way more of the patterns that is called obvious.
It suggests that a good girl must be very transportation, very humble and very subject.
It's the crisis.
The model of a good girl should be street.
It is supposed to be silence and it accepted the decisions of their father and your mother and the decisions of the animals, even if you don't want it.
If the house with a man who doesn't like or if the house with an old man, it has to accept it, because it doesn't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
If you have the very young house, it has to accept it.
Of course, they call it developing.
And what happens at the end.
In the words of a poem, "The house, and then gives light to more children and diagnoses."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, it includes the same lesson of obesity to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this visual circle.
The brothers and sisters -- when I was born Mala, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the news needs, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt very honest.
And so much before I was born, I thought of his name, and I was fascinated with a legal strange of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malatta Males, and I called my daughter so for it.
But when I looked at me, they were all men, and I took my plant, and I tried a line of my name, and I wrote, "Manney."
And when she grew up, when I was four years old and a half years old, my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school.
Yes, I should mention it.
You can give it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developing countries, but in poor countries, in the patients in the pathological societies, is a great performance for the life of girls.
Inspire in a school means the recognition.
A school to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and applications where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five brothers -- and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks before, when I turned out the form of vision of consideration, and I was in the religious part of family, I couldn't remember the elements of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my brothers written in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father could not give me to my brothers or their children, I thought I had to change it.
I used to learn the intelligence and the satellite of my daughter.
And I was able to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I encourage it to go to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to include it in their personality.
And this wasn't just for it, just for Malarity.
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids by the same.
I use education for the machine.
I teach my children, teach students to forget the lesson of the object.
I teach students to forget the lesson of the school called soldier.
You wanted brothers and sisters -- we ended up for more rights for women, and we ended up to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was slow for human rights and in particular, for the rights of women.
It was called the talent.
That means a complete negative of women in all political activity, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools.
The girls were told to go to school.
Women were forced to use sales and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silent, the little girls and the stranger stories.
They suffer millions -- but a few of them said, and it was scary to have those people who kill and stop when you talk about their rights.
It's really artificial.
At the age of 10 years, Malatta came up and went down the right to education.
I wrote a day for the Bible blog, he offered her for the Doctors of New York Times, and I talked to each platform that I could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It works like a calculation around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban was not able to tolerate his campaign and the nine of October 2011, they gave it to the head in the head.
It was a family day for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
As my daughter was describing between life and death, I used to show my wife to my wife, "I should tell you what happened to my daughter, to your daughter?"
And I immediately said, "Please don't blame you.
It defined the right cause.
You put your life in play for the cause of truth, by the cause of peace -- and by the cause of education, and your daughter is inspired in you and got up.
They were both on the right path and God provided it.
These few words meant a lot for me, and I didn't ask you again.
When Malatta was in the hospital and I had separate pain and strong dollars of head because his facial nerve was cut up, I used to see a dark shadow that was extracted by the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never come down.
I used to say, "I'm good with my smile and with the environment in my face.
I'm going to give me good. Please don't worry.
It was a conflict for us, and we consider.
The brothers and sisters -- we've learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women -- it's like any 16 years old.
It calls when he wasn't just his task.
It's pulled with their brothers and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there of special in my tumor that has done so healthy to Malarity so value, expression and economics."
I say, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's everything.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operating from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently have gone to the Monterey group of Google, where I've had a divided to my car, the visualization of Google TED, but all the work that I'm talking today about the science of the brain, I asked it before I got to Google or outside of my work there.
You have said this, there is a system when you tell a brain operation to you.
Do you still be equal or not?
Wouldn't you be like, you could be a smart being?
And then the neuroscience, I got a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the Greek material, but it was the performance part of the center that creates important hours and neuroscience.
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide what about to take from more than a dozen children every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combination and microscopes and to try to get them, to continue to keep life.
More than once I've saved a little time.
But luckily, I have an experiment, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the principles on the last few that there really doesn't have a clear map that tells it in detail.
I started to test with different microscopes and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in the days changed dramatically my authority, my sense of who I was me, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly amazing case -- for a few months, I tried two and typical chemicals for a young man, and I was surprised to see how my thinking.
I was always fundamentally, I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the most smart person around the world, and --                                            
It turned out as an extreme one.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be architecture.
In fact, I was trying to be trying to get a problem that I had to the front and it simply doesn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my dogs.
But I think that experience gave me a new performance about men and what they have to go back, since then I get better with men.
So what I was trying to do -- when you get those hours and neuroscience and so forth, I was to collect my intelligence after disease and operation, my creative thinking of ideas.
So I tend to think about all of the images, and that became my key point of recently, how do you get those mental images that I used to create professionals, my ideas, if you want to be providing, providing new ideas and recording situations.
This kind of thinking is not new.
Philanthropolists like Human, Desert and Hones look at things in a similar way.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are those who care about this idea, and there are a lot of discussion about how the mind works. For me is simple, for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for creative and investigation thinking.
So after several years, I can find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental models -- really fun, well supportives and good structures.
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images of my mind to the screen screen.
Do you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to draw the world that has the forest?
Or if a music could extract the music of your head.
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that the creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difficulty to do this is just increase the revolution of our brain scale systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments made by two different groups in neurons.
Both of them used in the IRI technology, imagine by functional magnetic research, to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scene made by George Gandom and their colleagues of Harrie.
The computer on the left shows the scene of a person who looks at a picture.
The middle of the media shows the scene of the brain of that same individual as it would imagine, watching that same picture.
The color of the right is created by the content of the central computer of the left -- you see that the difference is almost nothing.
This is a lot of different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine that same image is almost nothing.
Now, let me share you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack Galax in Berroon, California.
They were able to become the brain waves in real visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were picked up their brains to create a great risk of resources in the brain to video sequences.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as it was recorded a new stage.
The computer, using just the brain information of the scene I decided to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the computers of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This gave us backgrounds.
We're good about doing it.
We just need to improve the revolution.
And now, remember that when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same map.
This led to the fact with the world's brain system systems available today, and his revolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the revolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open up the brain and introduce electrodes to interact.
I don't offer for that.
A lot of these are providing new techniques of projection for images -- even me. With the recent result of the IRI, first we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way that the only way to get greater revolution is with more big, but at this point, the larger images only offer little improvement in the revolution, not increase for thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than more big, we make better mines.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different programs, like making a spirit.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in the IBM were to make a really big moments, right?
However, most of the recent advances in replacement of greenhouse solutions and brilliant solutions in building and devotional researchers, in the transportations and radio records of radio Rared systems in the systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic mammal, we use magnetic patterns to the frames of radio Rared frames.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio radio processing patterns we can increase the information that you can extract in a single stage.
In addition, we can then divide on the layer of the structure of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use the RMD we should be able to measure not just the flow of blood blood -- but the home of the hours and neuroscientists that I've mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity. This is the dream.
We will be able to fly our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Do you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the thought.
What would we be able to be?
And how do we learn to deal with the truth of human thinking without film?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be terrible to use it as tools to apply our thinking and communication.
And certainly this same tool could lead to the cure of Althenical and similar disease.
We have a few choices to open this door.
In all ways, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that I'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you this night about coming out of the arm, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay arm.
I think we all have artists.
Their arm may be saying to some person for the first time that the love or tell someone who is pregnant or to tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have cancer, or any other conversation that you have brought in life.
All artist is a difficult conversation -- and even though our issues can come together, the experience of having lived and have come out of that art is a universal thing.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked on the South San Washington California, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through a lot of pieces of the intensity of the linear military minister, not to raise my attacks, to take the letters from the Adam Diet Drive as a law.
And I would be feeling that by the hospital of my short pant, and I would have adopted my head and I would just ask my head a little kid -- "Hey, are you kid or girl."
And it would get a silence in the table.
I appreciate my management a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a root of rational.
The father was completely the newspaper and the mother would launch a free looked at his son.
But I would not say anything, and I would be going to be in the inside.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight up.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised the next time to say something.
I would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
Are you a kid or a girl."
A family silence, but this time was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues on the table.  I had the Better Francisco times.
The Galaxies State bottles.
Even a picture of the "movies of the value that I would show you.
And so I was going to breathe up and I went down the look and my shoes a four years with a red service, looking at what is not a challenge for a female game, just a girl with a question: "Are you kid or girl."
So I was going to go back back to the back again, I got out of climbers close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a conflict thing.
I have the short horse like a girl, and I see a kid, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a red service, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable piece.
Well, I'm more than a couple of a complete piece.
And that girl looked at me, presenting attention, and he said, "My favorite picture is violent and it has a fish.
Can you give me a park, please.
And that was everything. Just "Oh, yeah. You're a girl.
What happens to the park I asked."
It was the most easy conversation of all I've ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the park and I, both of us were honest to each other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some streets in my life, and yes, often my walls used to be a drug.
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how you feel living in a arm.
This is how my architecture is not different to your or you or you.
I mean, I will give you 100 reasons why to get out of my arm was more difficult than coming out of it, but this is the question, the hard thing is not relatively.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have been diagnosed in red bank is more difficult than saying it has been and forget?
Who can tell me that this story that I know is more difficult than saying to your five years that are going to divide?
There is no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We need to stop capitalized what is difficult with it to what hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our arms, and we should only feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
In some point in our lives, we all live in arms, and they may make security feel or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls are done, a arm is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine itself 20 years ago.
And I had a horse tail and a self-interest and high sand.
It was not the military legal legal to fight any child from four years who will go into the coffee.
I was frozen by the fear of fear in a corner of my dark arm by making my favorite graph, and the moving only one muscle is the most amazing thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, extremely strange that I've spent my entire life trying to do not depressing them, and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was looking at the pages of a world that we all followed for so much time, but if you don't launch that big, you kill you.
One of my most memory laws was in the bottom of my sister.
It was the first time that a lot between the individuals knew that it was gay, and when I do my home lab laborators in my black seat and tons -- I walked around the table and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who met me made years ago.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women, I got National Lanea.
And the gay battle had started.
"She was in the Casta."
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco?
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's fantastic."
"Hey, you know my strategy attack?
It's very good and never talked about having novel."
"She says, "What is your favorite TV program.
Our favorite program, Gill and Grand.
And you know who loves us, Japan.
Jama is our favorite.
And then a woman, described but in waiting to show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my wife uses red cameras.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the grandmother laws.
It could have been easy to figure out where they felt meaning.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were forced.
And what other thing can you ask someone to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
If you're going to be authoritarian with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authority that you get.
That's how hard conversations follow without being my strong point.
They ask anyone who has come out.
But I'm better, and I know what I like to call the three principles of the Girls of Packins.
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but they understand that what it involves out of any art is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authoritarian.
Take the architecture. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no architecture but I was ready to the battle of the box.
If you want someone to be general, others must know that we also suffer as well.
Number two, they're different. You just give it away. They take your parages.
If you know that they're gay -- you know.
If you say to their parents that maybe could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important.  They leave the complex.
You communicate their truth.
You're going to be shown by that.
And some of them can go out of sure, depressing for what they have done, but they never realized why they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel depressed, but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters.
So the next time you find in an artificial dark by making a big, you must know that we all have been there before.
And you may feel very often, but they're not.
Thank you, Bobby. Discovery the version.
Interview, what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence -- a productive example has been the famous quote of Edinterness Disconduct that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of if a submist can notice."
When Edinout Disconduct wrote this as a critical to the police pages like Alexander Turkey.
And so, some years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an open race -- that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or nature of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long, so you can see the Earth for millions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorisms, we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from an advantage race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence from Earth, you would see advertised to develop a physical theory that explains how to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that are going to do the surface of a very mysterious planet they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that you can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I announced a variety of issues through science, through several discussions, that they were like, to a only underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In California, for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally scared for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that manipulate the diversity of the future possible.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to address the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of making complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and putting them together together, I said, since many years ago, there is an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we could extract from all these different issues.
Is there just an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes, what you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to one and to me for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a surface that intelligence is a force -- Frank, which acts with the end of measuring the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with a force -- with the diversity of possible future future, yes, to an immediate time in the future time, the top one.
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be adapted.
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and keep open options.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How productive is it?
Does the level of human intelligence.
Do you predict artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: recent research research has suggested that the universe that produce more development, or an antibiotics, during their life should have tendency to more favorite conditions for the existence of smart beings like us.
But what happens if that tendent political connection between the training and intelligence is a more profound relationship.
What if smart behavior is not only related to the production of the long player, but it actually goes straight from it?
To find it, we've developed a software of software called Androne, designed to maximize the production of the long power in any system where it finds in.
So surprisingly, Androne was able to spend multiple animals of animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even win money eating action, all of them without being involved to do that.
Here are some examples of Internet in action.
At the same thing that a foot of foot without carried, here we see Androne writing a piece using a car.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Anger a goal.
It just decided for her account to balance the point.
This balance of balance will have applications for human robotics and human attention.
This capacity of tools of tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, as a few other animals can be able to run out of extreme opposites of a room at the same time to release the food, here we see that Anderson can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
International is absolutely applied to a variety of dominans.
For example, here we see it extremely playing a game game against itself, including their potential for play.
So here we look at the Anternation to address new connections in a social network where friends are described constantly and keep up with success.
This same capacity of network also has applications in the care of health, in energy and intelligence.
So here we look at the Arguan to organize the rocks of a boat flower, discovered with success and using the Pack of Pandan to address the global level of the Australia to the Packin.
In the same way, Androne is absolutely applied to problems in autonomous defense and anti-pocitical definition.
Finally, here we look at the American to discover and pick up a computer strategy -- sold in a series of conservation of action, essentially increasing active activists under their environmental generation.
This ability of risk of risk will have applications in financial and safe.
Alacan Kerominanda. What you've seen is that a variety of markets of human cognitive behaviors like the use of tools, walking out and social cooperation -- all of the disease of a single equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony.
We went back to the beginning of the use of the robot of the robot -- the Russian work -- there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines -- there would be a scientific relationship.
The machines would get against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of cyber religion to investment.
It's not that machines first become smart and then they try to get out of the world.
It's all the opposite -- that the impact of taking the control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence -- that general intelligence can actually come out of taking the control instead of being the grade.
Another important consequence is the search of the goal.
They often ask me, "How do you look for goals of this kind of market?
My equivalent to that deployment to go to the destructions to help them build artificial intelligence or to help us understand human intelligence -- it's the next one, the intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're in a point of influence in human history, something between the conservation of stars and lose the planet we call "Home."
Now, in the last few years, we have addressed a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth comes up in the context of the universe.
The Separa mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which is just one between the thousands of planets of our galaxy.
Separatian is a space telescope that means the local intensity of stars when planets go around them and block a little bit of that light that comes in.
The data collected by Kelling shows the size of the planets on the way that there are between them and his mother star there.
In fact, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and robots like our solar planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their sun.
At its time, this gives you ready about if these planets that we find are strangers or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this fabric of potentially stranger world, our own planet is happening under the weight of humanity.
The year 2011 was the most expensive record.
Glasses and marine ice who have been with us from millions now are dependent in terms of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused global scale have been supported quickly our ability to add their course.
But I am not the climate of climate and anti-production.
But I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that you look for foreign opportunities in the immune sector.
Now, as someone very interested in life for life in the universe I can tell you that the more similar planets to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invite a comparison between the planet and the planets we know better, the of our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rock and despite being a little bit further from the sun, you can consider a potential world showing this for a mission like Kelando.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been starting on the past, and in part, it's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our governments like the Current show their surface in search for the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that organize, like MIT mission -- take samples of the marine atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their sand.
The private companies now offer not only class volunteers but also the ability to live in Mars.
But despite all these marine images remind us to the desert of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with vanious ideas and pieces, in comparison with Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the destructive areas of our planet that are still going to collect, places really extraordinary in comparison with Mars.
Even in the smallest places and more electrodes from the Earth is French and report of oxygen oxygen by our tropical forests to thousands of miles of distance.
I worry about this entrepreneur by the collection of Mars and other planets that I have a big and sad planets with a big and sad shadow, the impact and the belief of some that Mars would expect there to save us from this influence influence of the only planet that we know it's really strange, the Earth.
For a lot of that I like the international exploration -- I'm in deep development with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how to imagine that the capability of the Titanic is how to imagine that the care of the Time will have place later in the wild boat.
But the goals for the international exploration and the land presentation is not controlled.
No, they're actually expensive from the same money, the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world are like extraordinary paradigments.
You just find it closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep standard spaces, in the hostile areas and innovations of the land, maybe we can face the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment.
A lot of years ago, the East Africa Feeds said, and that our universe has existed from a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of foreign life to now.
Well, where are you?
Well, a possible solution to the Fear paradox is that when civilizations become essentially advanced enough to consider to be living between the stars, lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that put this development.
It is architecture to think that only the inner complexity will save us from ourselves, but the planet of planet and intelligent exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to support American environments for human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even more easy to preserve the ability on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was in the front party looking at my balls, I realized that I didn't have the laps.
In fact, I could see the window that they were in the shape of the food, where I had left them.
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all right.
I thought to call a carbon, at least I had my cell phone, but at the middle of the machine, a brain could take a lot of time to come up, and he made cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I was able to get my paper and my bad.
It would be expensive, but sure that not more expensive than a carbon in the middle of a night, so I thought, as I thought, despite the circumstances -- it would be very well.
I'm a professor neurons and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
Climbing corruption that increases the heart of heart rate, molecular levels and noticed thinking.
And when I came to the face of factory in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my paper.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without doing.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in their place, that avoid that bad things happen.
Or at least if you have bad things, that they minimize the probability that it's a total care.
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't create.
I was sitting with my colleague Daniel Kanglade, won from the Nobel Prize, and a little bit of a support told him that I broke the window -- and, from that I had forgotten my paper, and Danny shared with me that he had been making something called professional reproduction.
It's something that he had learned from the Garba Garba Planet, who had written from this a few years before, known as the present.
You all know what the professor is.
Every time there is a disaster -- a team of experts comes and try to figure out what came wrong, right?
In the present, as Dana explains Danny, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and it tries to figure out what can do to avoid that things happen or to minimize the day.
So what I want to talk to you is some things that we can do in the form of a presentation.
Some of them are visible, others are not so evidence.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, to figure out a place for the things that are lost easily.
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that support this test, based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called himposing -- which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a sense of the location of important things, where the good is, where the fish is, where the fish is -- where the first fires live -- where friends are living and energy.
The hypothesis is the part of the brain that is grateful in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the streets to find their needs.
And if you ask it if someone really made the experiment, they cut the flower sense of the streets and they still could find their needs.
They didn't use the play, but the hypothetical memory, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things to move a lot.
This is the reason to lose the car lands, general and papers of reading and papers.
So in home they have a place for the lands, a galaxy next to the door, maybe a democracy plant.
For their paper, a particular box.
For their reading galaxies, a particular table.
If you drive a place and they're superfully supporting with it to be there when you look at them.
What about the values?
Take with the cell a picture of their credit cards -- literature to drive up, passes it by your face for themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or robots, this can facilitate the substance.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain free corruption.
The cortex is toxic and entrepreneur the thinking.
So part of the average practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems in their site.
And there is perhaps not more interesting that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to take a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a beautiful being, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical approach.
But this is except as a program for all of medical decisions and in fact for the form of financial decisions.
So let's suppose that they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the colony is a little bit high."
They all know that high colony is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack to the heart, service from brain.
So one is thinking that you have high color is not the best thing, then the doctor says, "I would like to get a drug to help you reduce the color, a statement."
And maybe you have heard of statistics, and you know that it's one of the most necessary drugs in the world today, even it's likely to know people who take them.
So you think, "Yes, I remember the statement?
But there's a question that you need to do then, a statistics that is supposed to ask that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for NASA, the number needs to treat it.
And what is this, the NASh.
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or support a surgery in any medical processing before it helps a person.
And should you think about what kind of design statistics is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not get me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not collection of the doctor, and if it's collection of somebody, it's about scientists like me.
We have not understood a very good underlying mechanisms.
But the extraordinary estimates that 90 percent of the drugs works only 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most amazing state recording, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before it helps a person?
OK.
This is with the research of the Canada Green research and Palent Harrie, built in independent form by Belling.
I just explore numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid one year before we avoid a heart attack -- server brain or another old event.
Now you may think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my colleague.
Why don't not, doctor? Tell me the recipe of all moderns?
But then you have to ask for a more statistics, and it's "The "Partnerland of security effects. Right?
For this particular medicine, the high effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those transportation things include terrible things, denotal pain and architecture, but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still taking the medicine."
But a moment.
Remember you don't think of costs.
So you think about how they would look at this with time, so they don't have to make the root of reason in the act.
300 people take the fragment, right?
You have 15 times more likely to go back by the drug that it helps you to help you.
I don't say they should or not take the atmosphere.
I just say you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical type requires it, it's part of the beginning of informed consequence.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start conversation about if you want to take risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number on the air for the value of the character, but actually this number needs to treat is pretty typical to treat it.
For the surgery that most of it is done in the largest men in the pressure of 50,000 experience of the prostate of cancer, the number necessary to treat is 40.
This is, 40 surgeries for a person who has help.
And the high effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the impact or architecture discovery, increasingly, regional light, recently income income.
And if you have lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just will give a year or two.
So the idea of the promise is to think about time the questions that you can plan to be able to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option a lot of times, you want a more short life of pain, or a long life that could have a lot of pain to the end.
These are the things that you talk about and think about now, with his family and their beautiful beings.
They can change from opinion in the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain free collective under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they get a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
So face with a depression, it's not necessary the digital system, or the life or the immune system, because if the body is spending medical in those things, it doesn't react with rapid. They could be the lunch of the legs, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logic thinking, like Daniel Kanya and their colleagues have shown up.
So we have to train to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all definitely.
We're all going to fail in the time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those faces, to put the systems in the place that will help me minimize the day, or to avoid that bad things happen in the first place.
Reconditional at night in Monomy, when I came back from my journey -- my control inspired me a combination of combination together to the door, with a leader of the passenger door in the same way, a easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I have no offered, and lots of message messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a graphic process, and I'm getting it.
Thank you very much.
Internet, Phila, "My is my favorite music.
It means to play sure.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a piece of purpose, you need to play more sure.
Two point, even more subject.
Four point, extremely subject.
This is my drawing of a tree tree, there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of people can have never come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence, a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the ASPA, besides a little bit of my own story.
The French language came over for the 1970s, and with the step of the time, you mix with local signs, and it's developed the language that we know as ALSA.
So it has a story of about 200 years.
He was born seriously, and they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
Sounds are a very important part of my life, they really are in my mind every day.
As a serious person who lives in a sound of sound, is as if I live in a foreign country, following certainly their rules -- computers, behaviors and rules and rules without them.
So how do you understand sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my attacks and apply the sound.
I learned and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people respond to it.
So I've learned for example.
"Don't hear the door."
Don't make a lot of noise when you eat the ball of the paper face.
"Don't extract -- and when you're eating -- I'm going to be able to run the correspons on the planet."
All of this is called sound "the sound.
Maybe I think about the other sound of sound that the average person does.
I'm kind of visional from sound.
And I'm always waiting with nervous service, which is to come to continue.
From there, this draw.
TED, to decide to do.
TED, for continuous.
TED, to analyze.
You can see that picture has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle books and man.
In high culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for "Pacific in the ASS.
A typical picture has five lines.
However, for me, to do the one with my player that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berring, Lesser, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
During this summer, I visited museum and spaces of different galaxies, and while I was from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was audience.
Now the sound has trained in my art terrible.
Is it going to show me more than art.
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it in technical way, or to experience it, or even as an idea.
So I decided to fix the sound of sound and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And all they had taught me in how much to sound, I decided to leave it and understand it.
I started creating a new body body.
And when I put it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention that I got up.
I realized that sound is like the money, the power, the control.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was an airplane, was something of an eye person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be deployed to me and my artistic work, or I could be able to be done.
I chose to be done.
There is a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my linear voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions, I work with many different interactions from ALSA.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me to be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Interestingly, when you ask their voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a press with a very high interest.
If I didn't continue with this practice -- I feel that it could stay in the ocean and not have any social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and AIDS.
For example, a musical note can be able to capture and express just on the paper.
And the same thing can say about a concept in ALSA.
The two are very space and highly modeling what means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like sound.
I'd like to share you a piece of the piano to understand better how the ASPA works.
So, imagine a piano.
The ASPA is divided in many different graphics paradigments.
If you add a different paradigm for every finger while the piano experience, the movement of the body, the movement of the body, the way of the body, the way of the body, the way of the body, the form of the hand, the English is a linear language.
However, the ASPA is more like a correct, you need the 10 fingers in the same way to express a clear concept or idea in ALSA.
If you just change the account, I would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens to the music in the tourism of tone, the tax and volume.
In ALSA, when you use these different graphic paradigments, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal sign in that."
This is the signal sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
Let me look at it.
Oh, I was carrying me.
Oh, oh there.
What are you looking for?
Oh, far?
So I got to think, and if I see the ASPA through the lens of music, the music.
If I had to create a sign and it would repeat it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of day, the sun goes out and put up.
This is all day."
If you repeat it and reduce speed, you can actually see as a musical piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say about all night.
All night.
This is all night, in this drug.
And this led me to think about about three different kinds of night, "No, by the night."
I feel that the third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time you express time in ALS and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one -- it's a hand, two houses -- it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is in the space.
So the first example is "I do a lot of time."
And then "Don't have "that was "the "show and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic idea at the time, there was one time.
"The community is a musical term with a specific pace of four times per company.
However, when I look at the word "Time "moment at the same time.
Look right -- see right, MIT, left hand.
We have the picture through the head and the chest.
Card, MIT, won failure "The Common Flash Camera -- I am going to show you a form of the hand called "The Flash "Pacebook."
Can you do it with me?
All of them in high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head as the chest, something like "The community or at the same time.
Yes, very well.
That means to send in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs of signs around the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means "political in the ASS.
Now, the third one. Please keep me again.
And again.
It's a microbial at AlSA.
We're going to do the three together.
"Let me, "Peteral and "like "like."
Good work.
Look at how the three signs are very similar -- all of them happen in the head and the chest, but they try to be very different.
It's amazing to see how the ASPA is alive and proposed, as the music.
However, today, we live in a very African world.
And only because the ASPA doesn't have sound, automatically no social value.
We have to start to figure out what the social value does and allow the ALS to allow your own value, without sound.
And this could be a step to make a more unusual society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be serious to learn ALSA.
AIDS is a rich tears and I'd like to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open their eyes, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even look at us.
Thank you.
Design Kalahanas, Hey, that's me.
As a kid, my parents said, "You can show it everything, but then you have to clean it.
freedom.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a business bubble or an ignorance bubble should say, because adults lie to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also show and that they're not very good to clean the others.
And the time I spent -- now I'm adult and construction and invented in the Harvard Congo school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach with a bunch of bases.
So as a good citizens, we clean the plants, and no, it's not getting analysis, and if it is, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but today over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic on.
It's a specific thing.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big banks and networks, to collect those plastic pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we call them and we collect this information in a map.
But it has a strange of a strategy, and it's very expensive and it's also very charter to use those huge boat.
So along with my students, with age of six to 15 years, we're going to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny subject in Hong Kong in a shoot.
We started building this whole job of work with an adult alternative so that the kids very bank can also participate too.
And I will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are great and safe.
Not exactly not.
Let's go back to the dish.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their free.
We do that.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine them into something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting plates of plastic, we just collect information.
By the use of a robot, we take a picture of this plastic -- children are excited about the robots.
Then we created what we call a project.
We are so fast in the creation of proteins that we ended before shark.
And we transform light limits and cameras in access and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly by water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We look at plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor while the computer computer will process this image and measure the size of each part, to get an approach of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this invention step on a website in a website for investors called "Internet, with the hope that someone else even more.
The great thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and I said, they're trying to solve it from immediate.
I can research my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
You see the news, you see the Internet, and they took up with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, clean a oil death, just using the hands, in Supermarkets, the largest manifestation of the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you know, is the water in which you get down, the water where they figure, the place where they live.
You can see also that water is mortality, the neighborhood and the oil are also broken and when everything looks like -- it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called specific, which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a spectrum that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make different species, which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we put it to Banglades.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
And I can investigate a problem at distance, I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further -- maybe I'm going to take a very difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half frames and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they had a number of giant waves -- called testing, and those tunations destroyed several cities in the cost of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a institution.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant of Ufrish, a nuclear central close to water.
And today, according to the programs an average of 300 tons are still supporting the nuclear plant in the Pacific ocean.
Today, all of the Pacific Ocean.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radio of Superconductor everywhere.
But if we look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation of the Japanese cost of the Japanese cost and most of the time, it has sure, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've gone back to Super every year from the accident.
Of course we didn't take them, the parents didn't allow them.
But every night we report to the control center, here you see the use of different music.
It could seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with race all their life.
So along with them we discovered the data recording that day, and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies -- the interface, etc.
And to do this, we created a reduction phone map of the region around the nuclear energy.
We created the map of electricity, we introduced pictures to represent data in real time of radiation, and we rock water to simulate the rain.
And with this we could notice that the radical dust was fighting from the top of the mountain to the Arab system and struggled on the ocean.
It was an approaching experience.
But with the basis in this we organize a civil experience, the closest to the nuclear central to the faith.
We take up to 15 miles of the nuclear center, and with the health help of the area of the area we were collecting the marine milk with a service of disease as we invented and build and build.
Here we see a program? We've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scale, also with open code technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more and more frustrated because we've only been starting to measure the day we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the jump and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a little bit of a little bit, we found an industrial institution in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space of social and environmental space.
It's in the Henilan Congo center and it is a place where we can work with wood metal -- chemical, a little bit of biologist, basically you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the kids of children can actually become really with the aid of adults and where adults can be children again.
Students, acceptance? Accelerator."
Card Death, we ask things like, we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy.
For example.
Or well, we can help in the movement of the advance of advanced age, transforming their streets of standard waves in new electric vehicles.
The plastic and oil and radiation are terrible legal, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the mentals.
We can't afford to protect kids in the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So scientific citizens, creatures, services, we need to prepare the next generation for the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two geometric colors, two gradually design cultures, raised design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel -- the other one of a single piece of sex.
One of them is synthetic, the other organization.
One is impossible about the environment, the other thing.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Microsoft Medical said that when he looked at the muscle in the brain, I saw a shape that should fight for being free.
The central was only the single New New tool.
But living beings are not constructed.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we take all the information of the information to work and to replicate it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by fires of manufacturing and production in mass.
Mountain lines have been diagnosed a world made of parts and transformed the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as a distributional parts of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find mathematical materials in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial panels are depressed with diagnosed pounds.
The steps of the room are more green with small people.
You act mostly as a filter, the other main as a bar, and yet, it's the same skin, there are no parts, there are no income there.
It is a system that would actually look at their function through the variation of specific.
Here is a divided screen that represents my vision of the world, the twice of every designer and architecture to work currently between the center and the genes, between the machine and the generation, between the machine and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two views of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and sense, it shows in the two screen after me.
My work, in their most simple level, trying to get these two views of the world, and they get out of the infrastructure and continued to growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why couldn't it be possible about 10 or even five years old.
We live at a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they build four devices that offers access to access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And in the interaction of these four fields, my team and I created me.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products and structures and tools through scale, of large scale, like this robotic arm with a 24-year-old career that some day is not very far to print entire buildings -- and graphics to national members made of genetic members that are broken in darkness.
Here we have invented the cell, a architecture of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each open is in the unique size to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a fall -- this was for a deal of Parts of Paris with Iraq -- it's like a second skin made of a single piece -- recording in the contents, flexible around the city.
So with collaborative 3D professional professional printing this layer and fall 3D without costs between cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This case combine rainforests and white materials in the back of 20 minutes.
This is the revolution of a human hair.
It's also the revolution of a CA: CA.
That designers have access to this high resolution and synthetic instruments -- allows to design products that are approaching not just the way our bodies, but also the physical structure of our tissue.
We've also designed a analysis chair -- a chair at the structure time, comfortable and also that addressed sound.
The Carrier Professor, my computer, we went back to nature to inspire it, and by designing this pattern of irreplication surface, it becomes sustainable.
We print this surface of 40 different properties that are going to be in redinning, operating and color, turning to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, would look at their function not through the other material of another material or the other influence, but looking at the material property.
But is it the ideal nature.
Isn't there parts in nature.
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the brain Bible, and one of them came up and come to define a lot of what matters.
As she relates to her, "In the third day of Creative, God sent to the Earth to grow up a French fragile tree from frame."
For that first fundamental tree, there would be no difference between transportation, same, ladies and fragiles.
All the tree was a frag.
Instead, the land did grow trees with rates, cortex and streets and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if the objects did from a single piece?
Will we go back to a better state of creation?
So we looked for the biological material -- the kind of material tree with fragility, and we found it.
The second largest biology on the planet is called the line, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms as a camera, black and coral and markets.
We think that if we could support their properties -- we could generate multiple structures in one piece of it.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal measurement.  We asked a lot of cards to walk up, we moved them and we produced it from free.
Varing the chemical contributions, we've been able to make a way of properties -- from dark, hard and operation, to light and surveys and transparency.
To print the structures in large scale, it was built a system with multiple bone balls of controlled controlled stranger.
The robot could save the properties of the material on the market and create these structures made from one material three feet long, 100 percent recording.
When pieces are ready -- you let them say to find a natural way to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with platform?
The air bubbles that were a surgery of the profession process were used to contain pictures that came up for the first time in the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
And along with our colleagues in Harvard and MIT, we put the bacteria designed to capture very quickly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into school.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without village problems, and if you take it even more, to sales.
A free fragile tree.
I would work with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with analyze water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of cards in an architecture that behave like a tree.
And here is the best part, for objects designed to biology, put in the sea, to feed marine life, and put in the ground, help grow a tree.
The addition for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We look at the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for international journey.
To do that, we need to give the bacteria and control their flower.
So as the periodic table -- we did our own elements of elements, new forms of life created computer and adventured form of biological form.
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid action, just that instead of growing metal metal metals, they feel new biological functions within very small channels within very small channels in the very small channels in the time.
This field is minimal methodia.
We print our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacteria.
In our first piece of rock, they bought two memories.
The first is carbon.
I live in our oceans and the water states of water.
And the second one, E, collaborative, the bacteria that was going to be in human interest.
One becomes the light in school, the other consumer consumption and produces useful biologists for the building environment.
But these two microbes don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never know.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of rock.
Think about it as evolution -- not for natural selection, but evolution for design.
To continue these relationships -- we've created a only channel that gets up to the digital treatment, which will help you flow these bacteria and they add their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, looking at the properties of the material according to the design force.
If we wanted more pictures, we had more transparent candidates.
This particular digital system, when it was out of an extreme to another, it was 60 feet.
This is half of the line of a football field, and 10 times more than our determined interview.
And here it is, as a prison at TED, our first particular impossible, ballet liquid law class with life within the room.
Thank you.
Mary Shanghai said, "We are critical crimes -- only half is made."
What if I design the other half.
And if we could create structures that increase life lives?
And if we could create personal microbes that would hide our skin, would they get the tissue day and support our bodies.
Think about this as a way to detect biology.
I call this the material economy.
For it, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in the road.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
It's growing up with social.
This color of the gun -- for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home inside which is market.
The manufacturing is not about this level of software.
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different conditions.
One act as a structure, the other is the picture or the marriage, using those fibers between each other.
And this happens through scale.
The subject of silk is going on in the environment, it creates a tension structure, and then it starts to fight a company calculation.
The tension and compassion, the two forces of life are manipulated in a single material.
With the end of understanding better how this complex process works, we put a small picture to the head of a silk subject, to the history.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the subject of the subject of the ground.
However, when you put the subject of silk in a flat paradigm, not within a box, we realized that he would have a flat calculation, and still microbial called significant.
So we began to design different environments -- different and different animals, and we've discovered that the form of the company, the collaboration structure is transported directly by the environment.
They often look at the subjects to death inside their calculations, their silk is going to be based up and used in the text industry.
We saw that designing these plants we can give the way to the crowd side without a single calculation.
They were made of sale, and we could create these things.
So we climb this process to the architectural scale.
We had a hunger robot making side plants, and we put us in our site.
We knew that the subjects of signal side to more dark areas and free, so we use a solar rock diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And then we created holes or artists, to block the areas of light and heat -- destroying the subjects of silk on the structure.
We were prepared to get the organisms.
We asked 650 subjects to a range of silk leadership.
And after making them four weeks, they were prepared to help with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the airplane, and as they helped, they created, they would get a bit of grandmothers, and life starts again, like us, but much more short to us.
But Bush Flood said that tension is the great interaction, and it was right.
In the high biological being biological on the head of reductive street, they give all this paper their intelligence.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, 650 subjects of silk are 600 miles.
In a symmetrical curious, this is also the length of the subject of the ground.
Pollen, after the electricity, produce 15 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional panels in the future.
So here are the two views of the world.
One ice is through a robotic arm, the other full value.
If the last force of design is to give the products and the buildings that reduce us, to form an economy of two materials -- designers have to join these two views of the world.
Which brings us back to us, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to an inspired nature in the design, which comes from us, for the first time, we make us charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Take your hand if you've ever asked you what you want to be a bigger."
If you had to remember what age had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can show it with the fingers.
three. Five three. Five. Five five.
Now, raise your hand if the question what you want to be a bigger."
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any animal.
I am somebody who could never answer the question what you want to be a bigger."
The problem wasn't that I had no interest -- but I had too much.
In school, I liked the English and the materials and the art and developed website. In addition, I played the wave in a neighborhood called Texama Francisco.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and think about all ways, for having a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of architecture, this feeling of architecture, this is not a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I get interested by another thing, something completely different, and I'm going to take up on it, and I let me address and I feel "Yes." I've found my month, and then again, this point where I start to stretch.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of animal, for two reasons.
The first was because I was not sure how I was going to become all this in a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, I would need all of my other passion, and get me to stretch up.
Another reason why I got so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong in this, and something wrong in me for not to define anything.
I was worried to have fear of company, or to be depressing, or anti-positive or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings -- I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have put up then.
Think of themselves, where they learned how to make meaning of bad or normal or normal to do things.
I would tell you where they learned it, they learned about culture.
We ask us first what you want to be a bigger."
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what you tell that age.
You consider an infinite question to provide light answers in children like being attention, or "I want to be a piece."
They teach the Dalaria device here.
This question is done over and over again while we grow in different forms --   -- expert students are wondering they're going to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be a bigger."
It's going to be the end of the end of before what the dream.
Why?
If this question inspired kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults really interested and say, "Oh, what law, but you can't be artificial and psychological and psychology.
You have to choose.
This is Dr. Bob Chinese --  and he is artificial and psychological and psychology.
And this friend of Michael is a becoming strange building in surgeon, company, professor and creative direction.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose it.
But it's more than that.
The notion of controlled life is very impossible in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real vaccine, the idea that every one of us has something to be going to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and develop their life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that depress their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that market.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a multiple.
A multiple is someone with many interests and creative activity.
It's a corrupt to say.
It could help if you divide in three parts -- multiple and potential and day.
You can also use other terms.
During the time of the Recent, the ideal was who was well looking at multiple discoveries.
Barrie Shell takes us like "school."
They use any term that you like or invent a own one.
It looks like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the molecule as limitation or afficiency that you should see.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas in my website, is that there are huge forces in this way.
Here's three multiple supercomputers.
One, the sense of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in interaction.
There is Hawain and Rala Bing exposed their interests shared in cartoon, visualization of data, mathematics, mathematics and design and design and design in the State State.
Meland is a company that creates graphic shots grandfather.
She was and Rapid and Rachine came up with this unique idea for their speed of skills and experiences.
innovation happens in interactions.
There are the new ideas.
And the multiple, with all of their ancestors can access to a huge amount of these interests.
The second multiple supply is fast learning.
When the multiple is interested by something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are studying to be printing, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and get out of our community areas.
A lot of skills are transparent to other disciplines, and we bring all that we've learned to every new area that we have, so rarely we start from zero.
North Don't get a complete journey and writer time.
As a piece of piece personal pictures a incredible ability to develop the musical memory.
Now, she is the fastest mechanical mechanism.
Before it became writing, North was a financial planning.
He had to learn the most final windows when they started their practice, and this ability helps to write conventional laws for educations.
Now it is a loss of time to get to what you get up, even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have prevented.
The third multiple supply is ability. It's to say, the ability to transform in any thing you need in a given situation.
Abed California is sometimes direct of videos -- other people, designers of website, sometimes controlled from Kingspoint, sometimes the show of Kinson, and sometimes at the time, James Bond.
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different trees, depending on the needs of their customers.
The Passan Fashi Company is defined as the most important ability for development, to prepare in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and improving that they are the individuals and organizations that can live to make the needs of the market, which they really will happen.
You know, very fast learning and application, three skills where the molecules are very different, and three skills that you could lose if they're prepared to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to feed the muscles to be themselves.
We have complex problems right right now, and we need creative things to do in front of them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, species.
They came out of the window knowing because they wanted to be a personal neurons.
They don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made from a species and a microbes molecule.
The species can be dealing in deep and put ideas on ideas, and the military offers a approach of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and cards that are and arrived with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the molecules in big part are just getting to be more like their special companies.
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope that it is this: recognize with the internal card, is what it is.
If you are a heart of heart -- then species all over the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the molecules in the room, including those who just realize to be one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, recognize with their many passion.
They follow their curiosity for those conflict magic.
They explore interactions.
Artisum our internal card brings us to a more authentic and happy life.
And maybe the most important thing, multiple, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In the year 1990, a woman named Auditoria took it to a psychological in Francisco.
It was supposed to determine and couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called Allows.
Allow I didn't know how to help Australia, but I came out of her until that, unfortunately, it failed in 1990.
After his death, Alama did a autonomous and found strange plants and electrons in the Audience brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
It's even more amazing.
If I would have been living today, we couldn't give it to her more help than the ones that Adam gave him 14 years ago.
Allow was Dr. Allow Alama.
And Australia Detail, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alternation disease.
From 1990, the medicine has left a lot.
They have been discovered and vaccines to protect them from infections, many treatments for cancer, anti-positive trains for the Christian, statistics for the cards and much more.
But a little bit has been programmed in the attention of the Alternation.
I'm part of a team of scientists that work to find a cure for Althenical from more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Allian now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2008, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If you expect to live until the 15 years or more, the possibility to control Alexander will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their years with Alexander or helping me take a friend or be wanted with Alexander.
In the United States, the care of Alexander costs 200 billion every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spending in the disease.
Today is the most expensive disease, and their costs pay an increase of five times in the year 2000, as I send the generation of the baby bank.
It may surprise them, but Althonian is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to build it.
Today, one of the first 10 countries of death all over the world, the Alternation is the only one that can't be prevented, cure or even religious their development.
We understand less than Althonian than other diseases, because we've invented less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spend 10 times more every year in the research of cancer than in the Alternative despite the fact that it costs more the Alternation and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause.
Because this is what a few people know, but all the world should be, the Alternation is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, all of the scientists -- even scientists, trust Althan Alternative with aging.
We think it's going to be sound in a normal and invisible part of aging.
But there is only to look at a picture of a healthy characteristic brain in comparison with a patient of Alexander to see the real physical day caused by this disease.
In addition to describe a loss loss of memory and mental skills -- the day to the brain caused by Alliandan reduces the hope of life, and it's always moral.
Remember, Dr. Allian found plants and strange electrons in the Arab brain a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they are made of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that is released as a organization.
There are places in the role that are public.
And when it gets good, these player dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some player dots are left on the outside.
So this makes the protein molecules go into each other, making groups that can form large plants and electrons.
That's what we see in the patients of patients with Alternation.
We've spent the last 10 years in University University trying to understand how this discovery works.
There are a lot of steps and the identity of what happens to block is complex as a bomb.
Come a cable could do anything.
To cut the other can make the bomb explore.
You have to find the right step that I block it, and then create a drug that makes it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and hope the best thing.
But now there is a different group of people, medical groups, biologists, general, children, engineering and mathematics.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block this step to stop disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen yet.
So let's look at a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in subjects.
These are the healthy substances, and you can see that they move with normal.
These substances, on the other hand, they have the protein molecules that are paid between them, as in humans with Alternation.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these subjects in a early stage, then we see they hold and live a normal life.
This is just a positive institutional result, but research like this shows that Althonical is a disease that we can understand and crazy.
After 14 years of hope, there's real hope of what can be done in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that I get that hope, to sell the Alternation, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to connect that Althenical is a disease and that if we try it, we can see it.
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have gotten more research and effective pressure of governments -- formal industry, about scientists and legalizations.
That was essential to go into the HIV treatment at the end of the 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to see cancer.
But Alternative patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their beings wanted day and night, they're often too desperate to go out and address for change.
So it really depends on you.
Allian is not in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain is running the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Australia, which can't create the change that they need to themselves.
They help by talking about them, and help to choose a culture.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Moment of New York Times in January Times.
To look at somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I tried to test it in a last night of the past.
So the process is pretty simple -- two strange people are trying to make 30 questions more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number 12 -- if you could wake up morning with a quality or skills, what would it be?
Number 21, when was the last time that you call the other person.
And right?
And as you get up, these are every more personal time.
Number 30,000 -- this really likes me -- Tell your partner what you or she or she -- I know very close this time, and I gave things that you will not say to someone that you have ever met.
When I took this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the character that two of the participants had spent six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was specific about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also interacting.
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to love.
We didn't know, we looked at us, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the computer love a few months later.
That was published in energy, and now it's already a state, so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, follow together yet.
And the reason I think you care about this is because they have done this question over and again in the last seven months.
And from this question is just what I want to talk today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before it would publish the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been writing about my experience in romantic love in my blog book.
But a blog condition can come to a few hundreds of view like many, and those were usually just my friends of Facebook and imagine that my article in the New York Times would be probably about thousands of view.
And that was a good act of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as a day, I had no idea.
And the article was published in line a lives at night, and on the side, this happened in the traffic of my blog block.
And the dominant, I had been called the Tomono So and the World Monday America.
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to figure out the confidence writing with their own smart experience, but another thing is to discover that the yellow life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or wrote, what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question, still they still get together.
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search in the edge of my email with the front, "Do you still go together.
And several messages came immediately.
They were in students and permission and stranger extremes like this.
They interviewed me in the radio and they asked it.
Even I gave a talk, and a woman recorded to the stage, "Hey, "Manne where is your nine?
And I immediately got a red.
I understand that this is part of the treatment.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the environment of the answer.
The 37 questions seemed to have been cut out of life.
In fact, the New York Times published a complete article for San Valley, which includes the experiences of the readers when I tried to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first slide to all this attention was to be very researcher with my own relationship.
I said not to every choice that we both did a public appearance together.
I was recorded in television interviews, and you remember the pieces of pictures of us two.
I think I had fear of becoming the investigating economists of the forest process -- a range for which I didn't feel in the absolute capable.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it really worked -- or it was, if I was able to produce perfect love -- not just a advantage, but love, a real love love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people would put the wrong question.
How do you know if we're going to keep together or not, and do you do it?
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 32 interesting questions.
Dr. Arthur Art wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1999, and there, the goal of research was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, I would look for an interesting performance between college students, using what they were called supporting personal Apple State, progress and recognition.
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
Participants felt more close after doing it. A number of public studies also used the Protection Amazon process as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strange strategies.
They have used it between the police and the community, and they've used it between people of hidden political ideas.
The original version of history, which I tried the last summer, which was to change personal questions with four minutes of visual contact -- was distributed in this article but unfortunately, it never published up.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small university of liberal art, and then a student came up to me and said to me and said to me and said to me and said to me and it didn't work.
He seemed described by it.
And I said, you want to say you love the person who did you do?
Well, he made a passenger.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends.
Do you feel that they were able to know better after testing the study.
The attention.
So it worked. I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it's about love.
I took up with the study for the first time when I was 21 and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20 -- what I was particularly supposed to all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I flew in science.
I invented everything that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hope that that could be a certain way to make the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just invented for the book that I wrote but in reproduction, it seems really obvious.
I thought if I fell up with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and just as I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one other way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more relatively.
I have more confidence to choose what you look for.
But I can also see it more clearly and I can tell you that what you look for is sometimes more than what they really can do to me.
What you look for love is a garage, not just to be love today, and it's going to be a morning, but it will continue to be threatened by the person I love.
It may be the grain that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 32 questions is that there can be a street to love it.
There may be a way for some way to measure some of the impossible risk, and this is a very abstract story, because let's look at us to feel wonderful, but it's also artificial.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that I ask, still follow together.
And his content with a answer of Yes or not.
So more than a question, I would propose that we ask more difficult questions, like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do we stay in love when things are complicated, and how do you know when to cut and distribute?
How do you live with the uncertainty that invited a relationship, or even more, how do you live with your paradigm, your paradigm?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more relevant conversation about what it means to love someone to love.
So if you want the version of the story of my relationship -- it's this -- a year ago, a knowledge and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we love us, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But let's look at it is not the same thing to stay love.
Let's look at is the easy part.
So at the end of my article wrote, love didn't happen.
We need to look at we love because we take the choice of it.
And I started a little bit when I read it right now, not because it's true, but because at the time, I had not considered everything that I guess that choice.
We don't consider how many times we would have both to take that decision, and how many times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he will always choose to me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and respond to 30 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous and a fun and fun and have experienced that choice.
But what I've done, in change, is to become my relationship in the kind of myth that I don't think of true.
And what I look for you, and what maybe going on my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the final happy in the title of my article -- which is, to proposition, the only part of the article that I actually didn't write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone and the hope that he also love me, and it's a strange, but that's the treatment with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few levels of month and in a way, I got like a grade of the forest.
The city of New York is a time ago --  something that really affected me but more detail detail.
I started with when I was eight years.
I took a wood box, and I learned a bit of a dollar, a platform and a tendency in it somewhere in Columbia.
And I thought some strange humans or a few of them will find this box about 500 years later, and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example, how we eat the spaces.
I had no idea.
In all ways, it has thanks because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in Harvard -- I like to go from except and make sure and all of those robot things, and I was doing a color for my mother.
And I took a diagnosis and I took all the pages and I made a kind of crowded climbers to the Website Ander Mars, the rest covered and a bee was adapted.
Well, my mother has fear on the bees and it is antibiotic to them, so it was more researchers in the time, thinking I could take it out.
Instead, it happened the opposite -- in some way it seemed to come out of size, as if you were going to look at the text with a light.
So I did, I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add electronic elements -- rates, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find on the street, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to draw around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow transportation, drawing the same thing about a way in the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and I created my own investigating spectrum.
First, banging -- that you can make an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the waste speeds.
And it was great, because I started to get experts and those things, and I was getting some money, to bring my girlfriend to find, for example, going to System.
It was stranger, man.
At some point I get interested by the human form of the human way, some natural size of human beings within the caps.
It was great, except for one thing. I would die.
I didn't know what to do, because the reserve was going to kill me.
And I went to the bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started to draw in the glass layers -- similar to the drawing in a window -- then in another window, and another window -- and I had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional compassion.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the research.
So I did this for years, and my work communicate with something very big than I call a Triangle."
For the Triangle, I was inspired in a big measure in "The Dark Dance Dance, which is a painting in the Museum in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic friend.
They say it's a little bit advanced to his time.
Well, the Triangle: I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has twice for what's 10 meters of compassion.
It's a little bit.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the laws.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are traveling between two worlds.
They go in the world of representation to this analyze of an animal male where they come up.
This is where the creatures with animals of animals are given to the cold, ready to support in the ocean in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a bird bird stopped to a hand.
Bill Grand is in the sea, the Howard per piece of the Death Player, Galaxies, the Republic Bio report -- there are all sorts of rare things that can find if you look very well in the ocean.
In all ways also a kind of communication.
It's coming out of the ocean, and I write oil in a hand while from the other hand they get clouds.
Their hands are like balls and it seems to be microbial that keeps Earth and company in balance.
So it's a aspect of the Triangle."
It's a little bit a narrative.
That's the hand that I expect.
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a transportation, like a piece of birds and I write clouds of this transport.
It also has a five meters long, a sense of sexual that goes to the Audience: The Trian."
In all ways, his tail is going to be able to go on a volume.
I don't know why it happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ended up in a hidden global balloon made of terrible streets of 1975.
Have you seen them?
They did in the 1970s, as if they were based balls of terrorism.
Very advanced to his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, you call professors.
It's about a six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an article of our culture, through media and material being emotionally, diagnosis or researchers.
But every one acts as a kind of architecture in ways of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they divide them.
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope of microbes that is 150 pounds with a human high human in their inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the head -- it's the chest, you can train the entire part.
I'm going to take you for the rest of the body, there is a cause that comes out of the chest, and that you cover the bridge or not, or what it is, a kind of antibiotic thing.
It's a quick report of these works because I can't explain it for a long time.
We have speeds, you can see.
This is a body part for half.
This has two head, and it's communicating between the two.
There are a few planes that go out and go into the head of this strange state.
There is a little free scene inside of the current care.
Can you see it?
In all ways, this talk is about these gentlemen, just like the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a charge box. It's called Pennage Rose.
In this box there is a physics, a neuroscience, a professor, a music, a music, a drug of radio -- a museum, a school, an educational arm that determines all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We get the box and all the people in the country with other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you define who is and the box that is living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of the brains, of the relationship, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same material and the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with double and generally we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you do it when you get your head.
They take a space.
But so that this planet has effect against the pain, first of the study, the interests and other organs.
To take a platform is the most effective and information for any drug metaphor in the body.
The development, though, is that when you bring it any drug into the democracy.
And this is a great problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take anti-power drugs -- these look at the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the DNA record.
But they are also known by their advanced security effects -- in their most negative, because in time you take to get to the blood corruption, they do stand, and worse even for the time you take to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV department.
These are regions of the body like the little lighting galaxies, the nervous system, the lungs, where virus is interacting and not easily in the blood source of patients that are being supported to the terrorist of the patients that are being supported to the terrorist teacher with antibiotic drugs.
However, after the interaction of treatment, viruses can wake up and influence new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs which is a treatment of life adventured by the ground.
One day, I felt and I thought, "Can we get the treatment directly to the department of the virus, without the risk of democracy of medicine?
As a scientific experience in leaders, the answer was from me, the leaders, of course.
If you use in an object, for the care of horizontal and surgery surgery, you can use for any amazing thing, including the international transportation of medicine.
In fact, we're using pulles of laser to open or perfect holes extremely small holes that open and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce medicine.
The best you ask, "How is that possible?
We send a little bit of a little bit of power to use about the cell member infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains fragment.
The leader goes through the cell, while the cell address the drug in a matter of microscopes.
Before you even realize the hole is represented immediately.
We are currently testing this technology in virtual technology or in Peter, but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply to the human body.
"What is that possible? You can ask question.
Well, the answer is, through a three head.
With the first head, which is our leader, we will make an incentive in the site.
The second head, which is a camera, shows the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, an instrument that describes the drug -- it released directly in the site of the influence as the laser is used again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you have success, this technology can lead to the total reduction of the HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the instrument of HIV in our case, a treatment with light.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studied to the stranger groups of not statistics, organized organizations like terrorists, instruments or military.
Donation what these groups do when they're not despite.
My goal is to understand the best to these genetic agents of violence and study ways to tackle the transition of violent participation to the conflict not violence.
I do field work, in the world of politics and the biological world.
To understand these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a device between states.
No.
Now it's a conflict between states and artistic acts now.
For example, in the 21st particular peace access between 1985, and 2011, 1980 were formed between a state and a great act of action.
So we need to understand these groups -- even we need to engage them or give them in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they fight, how they do it, but no one is looking at what they do when they don't play.
The subject struggle and politicians are not religious.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less to give them, without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the Libera Leadership, known by their violent focus against Israel.
From their creation in the 1970s, Hellond has also established a political part, a network of social services and a military approach.
In the same way, the Half Hambal, known by their straight attacks against Israel -- also administration the Facebook of Galax from 2003.
So these groups make more than just describe.
They're multiple.
They set up a complex combination of communication, rational stations of TV, the TED seats of the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the Standard magazine magazine in English and published to recover.
The armed groups also invest in a complex record of forests without sales, but by responsible business, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their favorite, increase their forests, to remember better and build their market.
The stranger groups also do something more, create more strong laws with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, and how they are adding hospitals -- they put professional information programs or members.
Hello offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to trust the population by offering something that the state doesn't drive, security and protection.
The attack of the Taliban in an Afghanistan developed by war, or even the beginning of the State Asia, can also understand the efforts of these groups for self-representative. security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly electric price for population.
But in general, to provide social services means to fill a vaccine, a gap left by the government, and allow these groups to face and increase their power.
For example, the electronic violence of 200 of the paper Hans can't understand without recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the stranger groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the forces of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hard.
They grow up because they get right down by the government, and they come up as a bunch of corroused and political groups, they participate in the violent struggle and give government.
And the more complex and software are these organizations, less we can apply it as something against a state.
How do you call a group like Hellons."
They give you part of a terrible, they are adding all of their functions -- they collect the base, additional the subject system.
Is it a state? Is it a religion group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is Stever:
The lines are destroyed.
We live in a world of states -- with no state and huge, and how much more weak are the states -- like in the Middle Middle East, more interviewed and fill that gap the actions not government.
This is important for governments, because to control these groups will have to invest more in the tools not military tools.
The government value has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and conflict peace.
If we understand better to the surrounding groups, we will understand better what incentives to offer to feed the transition of violence to not violence.
In this new device between states and actions are not statistically, the military power can win some bacteria, but we won't give us peace or station.
To achieve these goals we need to have a long piece of property to fill that security of security to fill that government vaccine that allowed these groups to prepare in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a female.
My opinions about gender equality are very, but I fear that to accept the straight of "Photograph would be an unfair for females.
I'm female, but pretty bad.
And so I take it up as a bad female.
Or at least I wrote an article -- and a book called "The Malace Galaxies, and then in interviews, people started to call me the German Market.
So what I started as a personal joke in my same and a developing property, it's become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, about all in my village and at 20 years, I had strange ideas about the females, these picked women with the men and they hate sex. As if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and the war, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But in that time, I was worried about the tone that was using people when I would inspire that it could be female.
It will be advanced as a feminist was a confidence, a word and degrees and degree.
And I was stuck as a woman who doesn't follow the rules -- which is a lot of the rules, with high autism and it opens to believe that it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that report woman, until you realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
At the time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, female, and also, proud of it.
For me, certain architects are surprised, women are equal to men.
We deserve the same subject for the same job.
We have right to travel around the world as we get it, free of access or violence.
We have right to use easy and accessible and representative services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies without need to negative control or electricity doctors.
We have the right to it.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have our other ideas.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, relationship of general, religion and security, social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have in account these differences and how they affect us, the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of institution, our phenomenon is nothing.
For me, these truth are visible, but to be clear -- I'm a design.
I'm full of controls.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad female.
I have another conference.
When I drive to work, I heard the dark music playing all volume.
Even though the letter led to women, and I got deep deeply, the classic "Stand Shakeroom from the Nine Tons Tennion is amazing.
"Do it really with your mouth market.
Bear, do you move until you get the context.
Think about it.
Post poet, right?
I am completely motivated by my musical points.
I think in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  all the diagnosed tasks -- but also killing insects -- the career record and the career of the scan and the management of market.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The red is my favorite color.
I enjoy the model of the way and the big things.
I can see "The Back and the romantic communities, and I have a lot of absorber factors of the stories of the faces that they do reality.
Some of my details are more destroyed.
If a woman wants to adapt the call of his husband -- it's your choice, and I'm not who to play up.
If a woman decides to stay in home to cross their children, access that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes essentially vulnerable through this choice, the problem is that our society is connected so that it makes women essentially vulnerable when they choose it.
Let's solve this problem.
I remember the conventional phenomenon that has ignored or developed the needs of the color women of color, the workers and the collections and transportations and transportations and the hundreds of white women, holestrate and high classrooms.
You hear -- if that's good, I'm a very bad phenomenon.
It also happens the next thing, as a female, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put families on a performance.
We hope that they are standing up to perfect.
When you get up, we would get them up with a lot of the same performance where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster -- I already consider that permanent before you try to put me there.
Many women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, they have fear of being attacked as females.
They have fear of putting up and say, "Yes, I'm female by fear of what that tag means -- for fear I can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Take for example to Berrie, or as I call it, the Diam.
In the last few years is a demonstration demonstration.
In the University Museum African African Audience, at MIT, I agreed in front of the word "Finance three feet high.
It was a wonderful spectrum -- to see this star of the police open up to the phenomenon and make women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
And spent the time, cultural creatures began intelligent debates if Bergenestrian was or not precisely female.
They called their female, instead of just creating the word of an adult and male woman.
We have the performance of females, because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot of -- we need so much a lot.
We go much beyond the critical and built, to design the phenomenon of any woman, to prove it until it doesn't have anything.
We don't need to do that.
The bad female, or more well, a more unusual phenomenon is the point.
But what happens later.
We spent to recognize our implications to realize the action and be a little more value.
If I listen to demonstration music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide a supporting subject.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we have the change affecting their generations.
No doubt is hard.
Why has your music that will be so presentative?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when the bad decisions are flowed by this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my substances, three and four years.
They are two wonderful girls -- decisions and brilliant and very value. I want you to believe in a world.
Where you appreciate the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, suddenly the best choice is linked as something much easier to do.
We can all take better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as a depression, you get the Turkey of Trees.
We can change radio screen when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the client in another part when movies don't treat women more than as democracy objects.
We can stop support to the professional sports where adults treat their companies as balloon sands.
In any case, men, especially men -- the white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your reserve, or working with you, until it doesn't include a enough number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until their public, or their organization is more including with a more complicated gas of people.
Those of us who are represented but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also keep us to be influenced until more like us are going to be generating to overcome the barriers to the designers of decision.
Because we are not a lot of people -- no of these efforts, without applying these positions, our actions are going to mean very little.
We can take these little acts of value and expect our decisions to get to the top of people in the direction and music products and music, CO2, the legal, the people who can take great decisions, more value, to create a dead and significant change.
We can also be able to save our female, well, bad, or any dollar it.
The last line of my book "Manner Female, says, "I want to be a bad phenomenon to not be at all.
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, especially because I add my voice was surrounded and the phenomenon helped me record me.
There was a income.
I call it intelligent to do what happened.
A couple of kids gave me when it was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was anything.
I started thinking that it wasn't anything.
They steal my voice, and after everything is going to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And then I went back to write.
I remember in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the shark skin.
The words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure it.
Through the writing and the female, I also discovered that if I was a little value, another woman could go and see that none of us is the nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything else.
And in the other, I'm going to support the remarkable reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad female, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without adding everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little value, when more you need that value.
Right after Christmas last year, 123 children in California had supporting to have seen Disconding or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then brought up the border with Canada, including over 100 children in Bending.
One of the traditional things of this joke is that the survival that can be easy for a child with a developing immune system, is one of the most easy diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this from more than a century, but many of the kids involved in the Disconnectic brain had not been value because their parents had fear of something even worse, the autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that gave the police about autism and developing vaccines and depressed and killed by being a free free by the British Medical Riderally?
Don't believe most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a study?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still afraid that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and address who had heard of she create all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence was still three or four children for every 10 dollars.
But then, in the 1970s, the numbers started to describe.
Forces of forests of funding records like Australia States are really reacting to autism as an epidemic -- as if I could get out of another child in Disk.
What's going on?
If they're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the center of the Center of American diseases what's going on, they tend to go down in fragiles like "Transportance distribution "Brains, and a better definition of cases, to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language is not a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for in the face of his two years, the visual context.
If the distance crisis had to get up, why were they so reduced to the beginning.
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s.
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with the slow progress and care of science than the self-interesting power of nature.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be happy, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark records of clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with an influence particular, read Kenya, from the hospital John Hopes. In 1999, Kanna published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be private world, not to the people around their own parents.
They were able to divide for hours running their hands to their face, but they were press of the audience by the mental mental mentals as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their human place without knowing it.
On the base of patients treated in their clinic clinic, Kanna species that autism is very rare.
For the 1970s, as a major authority of the world in the issue, to tell you that I had seen less than 150 real cases of their sendence as I collect references of places as far as South Africa.
And this is actually not to extract because the Banglades of Kangala for the distribution of autism were very service.
For example, I was able to give you that diagnosis to children with conflicts, but now we know that epidemic is very common in autism.
Once he was happy that he had become nine of 10 children sent by other doctors to their conflict for being automotive without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kangalo was an intelligent man, but part of their theories were not certainly.
It changed autism as a form of child physicists caused by cold parents and destroyed.
These kids, he said, have been manipulated in a record that not depressed.
At the same time, Kanna noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that are spreading in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in his clinic could distinguish between 18 situations before I was going to get the two years.
When his mother put one of their favorite designers, he really said, "Gerolish."
But Kanna had a bad opinion of these skills, making things like kids were just remembering what they had heard to their own parents, desperate to win their approach.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autonomous children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
So surprisingly, it wasn't until the 1990s that researchers started to test the theory of Kenya that autism was raise.
North King, collective psychology of London, I thought that the theory of the greenhouse mothers of Kanna was pretty stuff.
She and his wife John were clear people and effective, and they had a deep autonomous daughter called Susham.
North and John knew how hard it was to cure a girl like Susham without support services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To define the National National service of health that they needed more resources for automobile kids and their families, Lord and his colleague Julie Gollogy decided to do something that should be done 30 years ago.
They did a research study in the general population.
They had a subject of London called Carrie to try to find the automobile kids in the community.
And what you saw left that the Kangal model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colored and fun.
Some kids couldn't talk about all, while others were fascinated in their family by the strategy, in the dinosaurs or the generation of reality.
In another way, these kids didn't fit in giant friends and streets, as Justice said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Muslim model of Kangala would have predicted it.
At the beginning, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How no one had no period of these kids before?
But then Lord found a reference to an article published in Mexico in 1994, the next year at Kana, and then he came out, buried under the lessons of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember it.
Kannel knew about this article of compassion, but I went to survive it in their own work.
There was not even a tradition to the English but by lucky, the sea of America talked all all all all all all of a member, and he brought it for it.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man called Hans Sparia, which gives an integrated clinic with an integrated school in Vienna in the 1990s.
The ideas of Sparia for the teaching of children with learning differences were productive even for contemporary students.
The morning in his clinic started with society classes with music, and kids follow their games for the afternoon.
Instead of complicated to the parents to cause autism, Asphore described it as a political disability of life that requires compassionate forms of support and space spaces during the course of all life.
Instead of trying to treat kids in their clinic as patients -- Sparia called them their little teachers, and it turned out to help the development development development that were especially right for them.
Funding, Sparia saw autism as a different continent that would take a surprising variety of leaves and discovery.
He believed that autism and automobile traits were common and they always have been, seeing aspects of this continent in architecture known in the police culture like social scientist and destructive progress.
He was more there even to say, that for success in science and art, a piece of autism is essential.
North and Julia found that Kangala was wrong in that autism was really infected, so the parents were the causes.
In the next few years, they worked on silence with the American Assistance of Patient to apply the crisis of the diagnosis that would reflect the diversity of what they call a story assetting."
At the end of the 80 and early 90 of the '90s, their changes came into virtual model, using the limited model of Kanna for a world and including Sparis.
These changes didn't fall on red sand.
Casted, when North and Julia worked between strategies to remember these crisis, people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before "The Man Man in 1989, just a little circle, touched by experts knew what the autism was, but after the invisible attention of Delice Handscare -- like Random Bangladesh and the record of "The Man Manda with four prisoners of Africa, professionals, phones and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical evidence to use the autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little experiment of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of "The Man Mandela, the changes in the crisis and the interaction of these tests created an effect of network, a perfect total of the consciousness of autism.
The number of dinosaurs started to get back, the same thing that Lorden and Julia, in fact they expected that the people with autism and their families finally got the support and the services that are meeting.
So Andrew Washington came to fight vaccines for the increase in distributions, a simple, powerful story and surprising history as bad as the Kangary theory that autism was infected.
If the current estimate of the center of the center that one of eight children in the United States are in the spectrum -- it's right, the authors are one of the largest mental groups in the world.
In the last few years, automotive people have been joined in the Internet to remember the idea that they are the fish for solving the new medical advances, including the term never to celebrate the variety of human connection.
