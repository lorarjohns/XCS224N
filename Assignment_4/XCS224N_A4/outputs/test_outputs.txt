You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can break it like farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that <unk> usually is something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle years in the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare in class.
When I went up to bleed every week in the men's room, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me enter the bathroom room.
I did it <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I had the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never got to know us.
You could jump to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to get them wrong with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and we take care of her family, because it was necessary, because necessary, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy to talk about this.
It also needs -- it needs to -- it needs to have love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can, <unk> was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was a <unk> on the other <unk> of the snow year after year.
<unk> are born when they come from the glaciers or break the ice barriers.
Each iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment, and their experiences.
Some people refuse to bring up and hold it up to the end, whereas others can't afford it more and become a <unk> of passionate passion.
It's easy to think about it, when you see a <unk> that are isolated by themselves, and alone, as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing your inner atmosphere.
As you melts a iceberg releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are just that way and won't be going to exist again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg that photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's very often going to see a <unk> iceberg here.
Here they go.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a Greenland, of Greenland, <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each one -- a baby -- OK.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of yeah, I'm not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm binds to the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X of sperm binds to the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my ground activity I will play two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people are <unk> the anatomy -- -- of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as an <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical physics doesn't fit into male male and female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't fall into the other male forms or a female forms.
For example, it's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and it says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops by a typically female course.
When you get the baby <unk> it looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it is growing up and developing the breasts.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a Y <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's not really like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body -- something called glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The areolar glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider to consider a female <unk> not to know his <unk> structure, I think it's going to be a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 <unk> who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and with sexual relationships with her, I had a life like man and had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had a 20th and the <unk> <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it went to the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, she was a woman in it.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- they have <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgery is not to be able to have any better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you get to several surgeries is that it's a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy is delivered to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having <unk> identity, <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born as two people within one body.
The most peak of this is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the judgment of the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you take to figure out whether you're going to figure out whether you're <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does not traces a <unk> line between men and women or men and <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with categories.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone, where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States of today, are the struggles at principle and in end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors had never had to <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As long as a lot, you put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it yet.
If he stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining really somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be considered someone like me.
In policy I'm liberal, I will <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets nervous.
And so that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
So let's take advantage of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent one of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so <unk> in what they did, that I find every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
The fathers -- <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain why.
And what they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and they would relate to another that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as you all remember what our fathers would <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> monarchy was about a very naive concept of anatomy.
The old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blue.
They were from the idea that there was political power in the right of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents have rejected that idea and replace it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of game and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, and that was a very radical thing.
And part of them were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
The democracy was <unk> democracy and at the same time for the science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of Parents -- that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the regulatory explanations -- and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed from a <unk> right of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of 2007, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And by doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement of rights.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
And then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I am a man.
Again, people who are going to give the coincidence of <unk> on the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human being.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> in front of anatomy.
I don't want to say that for the five years of the age of five years, they would allow the sex relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should support it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk>
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, in the contrary, was born on March March 1 1980.
For the only fact that Mary had been born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before to Henry -- the right to the sex consent -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other people's rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on your hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people got caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and that to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests to people <unk>
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I love <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people in their skin, not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put in practice the subject of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue this current of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to put a job of sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made a couple of years ago that he had done to give birth twins to then pick up and so on.
But when the phone asked her the <unk> he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has considered the political seekers instead of separation to <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are unable to change the way the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to conclude, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to the <unk>
And I mean something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sex difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, -- on average, -- not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in college, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism -- I was considered to be a feminist, like <unk> made me a <unk>
Do you know what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, most of me have something like the female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers -- they were very aware to find the way to protect people in the state of the state, it's possible that, to have more <unk> to this concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we get to demand democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007 year, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth more than their <unk>
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds, of new cities.
Well, this might sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just took them through buildings in apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already would be owners and the other half is still not allowed to do it.
They might try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, to build a completely new, new apartments always and when the standards of that place will be built instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to have new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis. <unk>
In the next single presidential elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and an awful lot of evidence to users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that they say you can't go and memorize all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much about technologies like standards to <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They told me, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about how valuable cities are a lot more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that will <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covered over 100 kilometers square.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will measure at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's over 100,000 <unk>
All the world's <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained to him that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a city of a city that you might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to North Dakota.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help of European countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help us set up and make the norms of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually will be <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily about 1,000 square kilometers.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow you to create these special problems.
In a country that I had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
And all of them are <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On top of February 17 was passed again in another voting of <unk> to one.
And immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world who are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korea from <unk> is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in practical ways, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last of the last time for this new system of <unk>
There are urban urban planners that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know has been solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to immediately change another place.
There's a million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to get a job, sometimes these are unwed mothers that have to win the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen it, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> they asked me to say, "Thank you a TED TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before you show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession at a public confession -- and that's that, I live with the <unk>
I love to find, and he was most recently, photograph and publish my blog <unk> and <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second of the second hand allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I'm going to know people who are <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> And I think it's <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I would like color <unk>
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else I'd like to use after I got to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal at least 50 dollars.
All the <unk> including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be bad humor when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not only are you going to give you a little bit <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you have inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the <unk> or I remember it to their little age of seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look at you you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth -- six words for you. The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tested it again and again when people were approaching this week just because I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart, and I look at.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side is the intuitive side.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody that's completely logical.
This would be somebody that's totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself to be one of those people, that just as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need pretty good logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So a intuition that you can have developed over the age of the years is that one thing says that one thing can be only at one place at the time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar to play it taught a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking lot, play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really rare things -- as they can walk through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years on, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why he should not.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we make a very big zoom in the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a metal piece with a springboard and a springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost about the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip, and I started to work all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> swimming in the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable is being in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on a single elevator -- I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up to go up and do those things, because I don't want them to be <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of the inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to agree according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
He would take the lights, then you get a <unk> and pulled all the air, and then it will bring it at a temperature of less than a degree above zero percent.
Now, when you just be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it moved into very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way that <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when you give it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't fit at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that metal piece are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every single atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logical piece of speech.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you acting your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned the lights out, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- it claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were going to be <unk> with 17 very interesting museums than nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education, not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going on, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a big team of people, and we started to do it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery gallery at MoMA, the <unk> -- the Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the plane, and with one single click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, who want to go to the end of the hall,
continue to go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixel about the <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get over 10,000 million pixel here.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to make it <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I went and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and even deeper and you'll see that you can really get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to get the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, for a second.
So now we will quickly jump back to MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorite, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen it so before.
Let me show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things here, but I don't have time for <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create their own museum, to create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just got one spot here.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main things is that all incredible things don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble humble experience.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to your artwork and which is represented properly online.
And the big question that they do today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm out of Italian, Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something really interesting about careers of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
Now some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> are beginning to respond differently, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a story I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms in a way to become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says, at the end he took the hammer, and he threw it into the Moses -- you can actually see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- which is why not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup
Maybe some of you -- played Italy and France, and the final <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, finally, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
By the early afternoon, there are people around here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call on the bathroom.
Second time End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day, everyone went to the center of the winning team, and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from time -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city pulse of a city that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how you get <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in their change by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put a little chip on a little chip on the <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't stop that it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we dropped in a day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about, which is actually <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city who came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of use in public spaces in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It's believed as a water, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels and you can write in them, I'll show patterns patterns, images, texts.
And as you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
It liked it much.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows, no windows, but when you turn it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building, and all architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof goes down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've been <unk> but when it's low almost all architecture gone.
This is how it is working.
You see the people <unk> so it goes inside.
And here I'm myself trying to not be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way they interact with it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that kept doing cutting cuts and holes and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us, that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels of physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with other in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
It's kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in the one that you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can break all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels and you can play with them, with color and motion, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as an possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our environment, like a hurricane nursery of <unk> like calf <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make it all <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last couple of years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move it up, we can go from the digital world, the political power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move the digital world into the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are the pixel in our cloud,
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with the pixel covered in the Pacific.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the London Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could better improve it by a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or you might like to be in better ways, will be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and more secure than yes <unk>
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you going to tell you about it?
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How much people do we have creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> You probably owe the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people. That makes me feel good as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great 20th century of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if they actually accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the most interest of us.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There's been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but in fact, in its vast majority of our cells is more or less the same.
They realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the human insulin protein, which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human performance, but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the intestine more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully pragmatic environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, snowy -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to do with no effort.
It's really like a fast goes for bacteria with a occasional rush of <unk> <unk>
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only one of the human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that each cell is just divide and all the genetic energy from that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when diarrheal organisms appear to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the death of the body death goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every year he was happening, every year he was happening, every year I was going on, every year I had more doubt.
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous car dancer of clothes.
He looks at it and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"He's doing it, says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working by a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy for us.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted you to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we'll let us fall into the sea.
I think that everybody will <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily serve longevity.
They don't necessarily worship the bigger or the stronger or the faster or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution encourages the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> and yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and taken from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that you have an evolution of the traditional kind of traditional kind of human type.
And the argument here would be, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> when we have a <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution <unk>
But there's a third possibility, a <unk> intriguing and terrifying possibility.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to doing this?
First consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but is what you choose at individual and family level.
Think about it as possible if it could be able to choose not only sex in their own body -- but in their own body to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Don't want to make those changes in their genes.
If you look at the future, that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year after there was done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 million bases base of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 dollars and on a week.
Not much of us to actually make the human genome for <unk> and will be increasingly at the reach of all.
They come up those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin insulin in bacteria can make viruses not only to protect us from themselves, but they are going to induce <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine, in the cells of a plant plant.
Can you imagine something nice about <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg -- and give their children a better chance of a better life, to remove diabetes -- reduce the risk of cancer?
Who does not want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine in the science that can produce changes to prevent diseases to allow us to also allow us to adopt a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a faster chase muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't they live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can bring it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these options in advance of a better society, more successful society.
Or, let's choose selectively <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society which is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For a good time or for worse, before you have the way that these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds scary.
Well, I had a single car seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants with <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
It was <unk>
Imagine being on a plane and no <unk>
And then three words said ...
The three <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more to the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before she died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come and I didn't want to get it, all the fences that I wanted to be <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I got a sentence, it is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington bridge, which was not for a lot -- I thought, Wow, I feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes I've tried to better do anything I did.
But in my humanity, also giving place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that don't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have the reason to be <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental watch is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I went back, I had the feeling of, Wow, she will not be afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
A month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And to me, that was all of the reason to be the world.
At that point I got to connect those two points at that point that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle of not die that day.
And I was awarded another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live differently.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be like -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is the thing that you know, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the world's greatest <unk>
One day he came to his house after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not accessible to people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Somebody saw the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they communicate with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
And I was standing with his brother and his father there at that precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to do it again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inner can't be able to <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research, which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser, you draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All of the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the Bush attacks and the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of pharmaceutical companies and we got a machine so that we could build a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, I call it <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> world, from all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have removed the frames of the walls and in their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> ride my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun glasses that we buy on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of the copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it's going to build the code -- we release the code -- the software is going down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital to say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a planning year -- two weeks of programming, intense sessions from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the life support system and he's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was a <unk>
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and I would take me out there so I could get it out there.
It's not <unk>
In a certain way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the greatest inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in the center of Los Angeles -- is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it as possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a moment.
Do you look at it <unk> anything in this room.
I have no programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find ourselves with something we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations in usually very difficult and at the same time a little dangerous.
I went to <unk> difficult.
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
Film <unk> <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just -- a fun thing at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous to end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations where horrible looks at the only goal of trying to examine social issues in ways that we are trying to look at interesting, and hopefully let's measure interesting and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I pulled out an <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights from my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content I could <unk> in your face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company.
But I said this, it's a very good chance to do it.
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I could not have been able to go for certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we tested the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said before, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done with it, nothing could be done for something so hard or as dangerous as entering the room with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tried to treat <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is <unk> with <unk> marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> "The biggest <unk> is that everything on top at the bottom is that all up to the end, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more for <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the degree, but we're going to make sure you would have all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you've been <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The <unk> <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> from "The biggest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the full idea -- all of the film <unk>
And I would love to help them help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be the people.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One million and a half million <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worthwhile to convince a couple of big brands to you.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time that the movie comes out, we see a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be difficult to get it through the film or for being I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies were suddenly gone.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to come up with the product as much as possible, to make it as many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the apart, it's not the idea to tell you that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error, and that mistake was this one.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what is this picture.
See, when you look for images from <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were born.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line maybe the bigger problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it actually changes quite suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency day --  -- like that weird bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
You know, a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started to talk to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell you that <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to give them a story, but we want to have <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would love me in some lie -- and that's him looking at me, as he used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there is <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take out the phone and go to business myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is suddenly -- and I started to give me a little bit of <unk> is that when you start to talk about companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous <unk> giant <unk> and others who make small movies, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant films of <unk>
And the film is called "The biggest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you with you.
Maybe you should put yourself a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man like to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
Let's bring the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are rather than a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind you to <unk> people is the reason why this interest us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something audacious, cool.
I think it's a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you cool longer? With better <unk> three times more <unk>
They are things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of kind of guy.
I need to talk to a man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good job.
Woman: reviving the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, so many gray colors and things like this.
And I usually wear <unk> <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
Woman: If Dan <unk> could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: In some <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of genes.
They make toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> brand.
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be making Tom, but I often miss myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings to be.
MS: These are a different way to see the world.
A: Tell me that world.
MS: That's the world -- I think your world is the world where people around us, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> for what is that?
What is the <unk> What phase is you find you right now?
Why is it important? <unk> What's the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
And you don't have to be scared. What kind of mountain will be true.
MS: <unk> Thank you.)  No, thank you.
AT: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> Excellent. Thank you very much.) Thank you very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality <unk> The Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They got very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just going to become one of their strong spots or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to do -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they are afraid of fear, those elements -- and you actually failed them to sink and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple <unk>
And you can see here in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and conscious, those things that have gone and come up and have a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your brand, your personality performance, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or audacious as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar -- safe, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how now they use MRI in order to identify the centers of desire in the brain as much for marketing marketing as film.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden advertising <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts that companies are getting into the way in schools with money with the U.S. problems.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or the ones I've had more successful and the ones I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how had he gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was released in the Festival of <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then, and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just about a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, or TV or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we talk about giving them to their customers not be part.
I've always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks.
I think when you get the people from that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss is preparing all of your company to reward them for reward.
I feel that what has to happen to happen is we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not have the fear of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So then, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the Foundation, <unk> a check by <unk> to be applied to my attendance for next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, and we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box -- breaks the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching what we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> wore multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these fatty boxes.
It struck us attention, and we started an experiment in which we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they were very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab <unk> where they didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experienced different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place: now.
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So I called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to get the goal soon.
So we pulled up and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
It will be all the points to attack it.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and in high technology, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We were looking forward to <unk> and we were trying to <unk> it with the real world, with potential potential for the real world.
We need theories about how they can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> must be a violent valuable, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I call them and I asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do it slowly and <unk> in an obvious time to go back to the <unk> engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
And we're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> stands up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
So it's not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would be used to one single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is communicating with six water and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really <unk>
There's the gray box there, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of the sensors for example, from pressure sensors, and <unk> sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these data data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up with <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only to be <unk> to the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam vapor goes out of speed, you have to open tubes on a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, either.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And I don't have the <unk> or the security system that you do.
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see specifically, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have the <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of tube <unk>
It would be more possible.
And if you made that, with what you can do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better that we start to prepare right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower superpower, for this.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to lead and give skills to <unk> or other than making chairs from wheelchair to raise them up and come back again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing its speed, and for example, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect to the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that on average, you have to take on the back of a 45 pounds, and it is <unk> to bring even more crew.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can spend 90 pounds per land for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put into <unk> <unk> and running movements with big <unk>
And I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the chairs of the chairs of wheels, which I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the wheelchair, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people with the spinal cord than when their life is -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is <unk>
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago, he had a lesion of the neocortical column and as a result could not come back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to board, here on the back.
There is also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and make it move forward with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of it and everything <unk>
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You will never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last couple of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding a hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the festival. Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos of Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their relatives closest closest villages.
That means we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we have made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big things, <unk> the society, Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence has not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation they make you can't fill or a stadium with the bonobos who stay in the world -- and, honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have toxic sex -- <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
By <unk> as humans, they love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to make bonds and encourage the <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of behaviors, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you see the game Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human auditorium.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a white <unk> game, and I don't really talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the sentence, <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual play is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because you know, this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things unusual to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think about it, sometimes we played themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds, and outside.
And it's really playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with higher creativity and bigger cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But we would give it to the maximum capacity of game?
The game is not <unk>
Play is essential.
For Bonobos and human beings, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate play, it can be the moments in which it's the most urgent thing to be.
So fellow primates, accept this gift of evolution and play together as you <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain <unk> in a volunteer body of volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers serve a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high probability of going.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our homework was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
And we were at the middle night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he was asked to go and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a building in a building to save a live alive only because he won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and I bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firefighters <unk> who was at that height or less had ended up on the fire and went to the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door in the front door.
<unk> from the house for the house house where, like, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the <unk> house by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other thing was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my <unk> as a fireman as voluntary acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> acts and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or they are to get them to -- very remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you back now.
It would be food in a dining room, they would have a neighborhood park.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but each day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block of the picture.
The first concrete blocks was built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules from a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges -- a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He called him <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the brick bricks came to all the home.
It's estimated that they've been over 400 billion or 75 kilometers per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> world of <unk> stacked about each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> <unk> The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics every one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they bring together using magnets together.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the start, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one green one is making light.
Can we put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, and connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
So to make it faster or more slow, you just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an extra collection growing.
We want all these interactions in the world to become <unk> to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how does it work, or why the door of a elevator is kept open, or how a iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took them to the designers of the Rhode Island School of <unk> who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and I told them, do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> canyon turned around movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interaction world is ours.
So ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar <unk>
And my little company seeks to engage with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I would be just like time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
I took some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of serving the Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They did big <unk> worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a parking piece of Boston.
Here it appears as if I could look at a quote, but what really looks for is that someone would clean up when it got caught by snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we spent a lot last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did as a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
That is, it has a piece of ships.
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends into a viral way.
A responsible for <unk> systems of <unk> in order to see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people would steal the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to get people to break sidewalks up sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that we use using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't happen.
<unk> <unk> usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that I had done by normal channels it would have taken at least two years and side about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the California state of California that until the moment has run 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days and it spreads in viral form, it's kind of a shot shot from warning.
It suggests the best ways of working -- not as in private companies as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological enterprise, but rather, as the Internet itself.
That is, without constraints, in the form of open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we would have to engage with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
Do you feel a lot of frustration at that, but they don't get the <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that are <unk> the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they were alone not <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately brought us from -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> how to think about it impacts the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to choose <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of telephone telephone and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you <unk> <unk> in the United States.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put it very hard music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that's not the end of the <unk>
Boston has no calls.
It has a <unk> and <unk> called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this is really, really comes this <unk> <unk> on my garbage garbage -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I gave the <unk> I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income to collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I'm not necessarily talking about the technological definition.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have been connected to the governmental services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> communities.
If we call control animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
So a lot of people would do it, but you think one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will expand our values, and we would make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface of <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that keeps that belongs to us that we financed as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work will have to make the bureaucracy that the bureaucracy is sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes it <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And so that we have been <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't get in government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government as a government function that can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old than me, to <unk> I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who are going to <unk> they're going to talk about.
They can express their views on any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't really care about making your voices.
They're using their hands.
They set hands to the work to program apps that will work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away by taking away a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we are not only consumers -- we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and <unk>
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are telling you here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic role.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you're taught with feeling, they can have a special means.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was the daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little and I looked at her, she was approaching me and I gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching me, and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, he would give me back again and I was saying yes, I was left in peace.
It had this whole human quality that would always want to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room, and I looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at it and she was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, I went through the room, he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't see it. I said, "Sure."
I then sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> how do you do?"
He said, "The second thing I want you to do, is you always do the right thing if the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I did."
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, I know how to do it."
I grew up in the field, in the fourth village, I have a brother a year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> brought us to my sister and I went to the woods.
We just got to do the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, you know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I went down with the strength of the strength and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be thinking about conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit to you.
Let me tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe what to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there's 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, there's so much <unk> so much despair, because of these facts.
One of every three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail, or in parole.
In the urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Baltimore Washington, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all young people in the prison or in parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system, which is a lot better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but it's wealth that affects the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in some pretty curious developments here.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, I care about rights for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the loss of loss of rights to be as high as it was before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where the <unk> children will die in prison.
We have this country in prison for children, without a chance to come out.
We're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
It will be people in the death row of death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by criminal crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by error.
Of every nine <unk> people have identified that it's innocent that it's <unk> and liberated from the death <unk>
An innocent rate, an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation wouldn't allow you ever to fly planes if every nine -- you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on the history of history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that began at the end of the rebuilding and the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, was a very time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up with me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches people, <unk> <unk> to people who will stop saying that in our human history, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with segregation and decades of racism and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we were going to start with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not be lifted segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this engagement, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was in Germany by giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation, and he said, "You know it's OK to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we could never get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> would put us to <unk>
So let's get them about this.
How would we look in a world where a nation like Germany, and especially if they were in their major <unk>
We couldn't believe it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
We've talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never will come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a sense, something that is inside of our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen before.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
The development comes to innovation, with creativity.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not only in brilliant and <unk> but also in dark and difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in the East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation of the spirit is practically at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to the attention of poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
So we go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk about.
Occasionally, the lady was called me to say to me, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We are going to get them to talk about.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, and what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read it <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to help them.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom to <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death penalty for.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and at the end of the end I looked at me and said, "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> came up with me on the face and he said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I have come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very exhilarating, very exhilarating, not to judge us for our technology, for our designs, or our rational capacity or rational.
By the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> as they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> customers and 14 years old, that they have been <unk> so they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody in what it isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
And one night I was very late -- my God, if the judge can become something that you don't know, should have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> a <unk> poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my 14 black client to be treated as a privileged white <unk> from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police behavior and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how this country is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only there was a <unk> but he had sent the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got to the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got down the car. He walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of court.
When he looked at me, she came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I got up and I got up with me.
And I went on with the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
And it connected deeply with myself, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the whole room.
He got in, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started going.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops the prosecutors the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was filled with people -- all mad because we were talking about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I was able to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would just watch the window and try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a <unk> face in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a assistant at the end of the <unk> he showed himself because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, "What do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this <unk> ward to tell this young man to tell this young man to keep her view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We can't be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity should be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you that to keep your view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious <unk> of the audience, in this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to make an effort to give you the funds that have been spending today in punishment
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds to make the law to make the law of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you what you think is that?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The large <unk> growth in this country is not because of crimes in violence.
It's the wrong war on drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us for the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> <unk> to steal a bicycle by stealing their own crimes against property instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy on punishment is not doing anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've got excited to be <unk> right now.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

So let's look at, look, social <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be about the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds would pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than surviving, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make them damage.
So for a little bit of <unk> stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If you have blood blood, it's very true.
And because of all digital devices provide us the negative news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe, instead what happens is that we have <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, water loss, water scarcity.
As human beings are very good at <unk> problems, and in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has gone from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy of 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
So a lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, large part of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, television, mobile devices, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this is technology and, enough, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that's -- good and bad days, in the war and peace, in recession, on depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and its capacity to democratize and distribute personalized production on all the planet, biology biology, fuel and food, the food and the food, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory in "Jeopardy" of Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline that <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have been done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating life <unk> for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story from Napoleon <unk> in the mid-'80s, 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the <unk> king <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> of silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, worth more than gold and <unk>
So for that reason the tip of the Washington sentence is of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's linked to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he did the aluminum thing that we use it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that is <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of power every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power is 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study showing that at the end of the decade, in the United States, the solar power will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed pointed to the Voyager spacecraft Voyager toward the Earth, in 1990, after I passed it up.
<unk> a famous photograph.
"A <unk> <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent of the ice is ice, and we fought the water of the planet, but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen, this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I would like to share with you, my technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to make a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source, saltwater, water <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just agreed that it will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have full confidence in which it's going to be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it globally in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to reach 70 percent penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video clips -- video of books and music, technology -- <unk> technology -- now they are <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing gets to when you get the health applications in.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce the Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device with which talk, and because it has <unk> can be able to be able to get out of the blood of the finger <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a silver team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is about 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the health and the first place, to prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been before <unk> that added to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What <unk> What wishes <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D printing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the heavens wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What would you do? These three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that young teams made by his passion with an objective of course, they can do things -- things that before they could only do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end with sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined in, and they started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds and new minds we have to work on to work on the solution of big challenges, and do what we should do.
We have a couple of extraordinary decades in front of us.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He was caught up to the 1960s.
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they follow <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a tragedy in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 <unk> the black beard <unk>
And the fisheries of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five centimeters.
They put a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing to impose the countries that were already <unk> <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty good, <unk> <unk>
I went out of fishing in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea Sea, and mostly in the Sargasso Sea, and mostly in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I now know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny <unk> about <unk> remains that they're sea reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fishing.
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead turtle, one.
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to a area where they've never fish.
But he has no <unk>
And we don't remember.
We would take the starting point to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have a lot of bacterial things, number of whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the imagery <unk> at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing to get it forward.
The difference is they need loss loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk>
And at the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
And that, in big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when Western societies kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose a little bit of common.
Even if this isn't perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a very synonymous sea of large fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, it's not the way they would expect evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them are <unk> as the captain such as the captain of a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, usually they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can be a protected area.
Because with the protected areas we actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think about because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a marine marine protected area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema may be filling the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about it, if you think about why people would be moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that give, is to Cameron, do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm an Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why we will see why the videos are made up and what is important about it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed something very, very difficult.
But now the video video makes any of us, or our actions, it copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of people have viral and receives infinite views and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: We are creators of trends, communities of participation.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot out of his house in the National Park <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows the views on the <unk> rise of the past summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share the rainbow twice.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this leap to <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present with new things and interesting and <unk> to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.    You all want to come in the end of a week, the weekend.        <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Let's not think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it about 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> rainbow -- this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it up, and so many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of creators embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big internal joke then starts to talk about it and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other in the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation suspended with a <unk> music.
That's like this, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
The cats saw this video.
And there are cats you saw the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old version of the ancient one.
And then he did international her.
Suddenly, there was a whole community of <unk> which did this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today it's not only <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What script could it have been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video in a minute, just that really unexpected and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really interested in so much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you the circular prevent by the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise of the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million watched and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth about all new things that we do <unk>
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities of participation, fully unexpected, are characteristics of a new media -- of a new culture, that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't be allowed to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they are just the current media -- but we will give you the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only hope of unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, now I get it.
They would be stuck in silence.
He had broken through history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was destined to be a <unk> task for me from her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I could not do this.
And after a four-year-old <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat is <unk> to the sea dressed by the ice being called <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The highest fear was the fungus, rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were looking at it, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving in every wave, and the vast horizon and vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I can remember the lights from the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, he would finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tried for the age of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
And then three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class of <unk> the population is composed of immigrants in common.
Unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence <unk> in <unk> had no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English <unk> people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, twice a turn.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and <unk> an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't matter what was supposed to be <unk> which is usually <unk> clothes, always <unk>
Two pairs of school for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating and determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares began to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and <unk> and <unk> <unk> in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and intervention.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student, steal with what I <unk>
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many people got help over the years.
And for that job, when I was studying my last year of teacher, they chose the young Australian <unk>
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges of not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident from <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single day and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we got the boat.
Mine had never been a choice.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you look like?
So I spoke about <unk> juvenile education, education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the most frankly I was talking about it to talk about it to speak.
I met people of all the roads in life, many of them making what they would be living on the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't be on a serious career race.
There was to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new tradition in the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that is grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being in the inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a mixture of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
It would be a small group of people who <unk> "You can't afford it, it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> until the night of the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took a decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before finally, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who matters.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
So 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused an hour to the <unk> and take the cause she did, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in a hotel in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories, and we made sure we were still with it.
At the night a <unk> came and said that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since the people we were and how life we built now we can see that the men who would have come to us, they would have <unk>
<unk> would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could want that to do it?
However, I fear the privilege of easy to the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave person in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them for safe, I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the Red <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed since the age of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car, <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when we were <unk> the great Indian warrior was <unk> I took a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced with magic.
And that was a great deal.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me her <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technological <unk> was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to <unk>
We give our inspiration.
That's why I <unk> I got up to this technological world to see how to use magic, instead of <unk>
I had books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book, you know.
Where we are.
I bring text together with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I come up with a character of the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the GPS -- which comes led to me.
My little girl are excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And I really light your way into what we <unk> from the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag up to this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every book, we have always been maps but have been static.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the Indra cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child child <unk>
In a story that is about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not gone to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> stones, stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual, you have to go out and in a chapter, and in a chapter -- a flower picture and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This way you create a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video goes on, and it actually augmented a group of encouraged <unk> that happens on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to be a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology is coming up with one another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop hearing patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientist, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the greatest problems for what all of us, or perhaps not all of the projects of <unk> they fail -- because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a switches of it on and off.
Every morning I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when it needs <unk> or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I could go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to get more control of their health.
So from the week to be available on the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were taking care of their homes, to take their blood pressure, to get them to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, come back to <unk> and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care health care because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM ATM machine."
And also where are you all <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the most close thing to help this patient?
But we asked but no one of them.
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please look at <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> we were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use their iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to take it globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, on other universities, to help us find, and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on holiday and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They might be messaging messaging or people in <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here for sharing <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my old passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when you use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you click the <unk>
For me the photograph I had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
And so I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to push the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very crowded road.
But it has a <unk>
And yet, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful and colorful goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way like photograph.
You know, in which you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that has to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real real.
They're the details or the <unk>
We would make light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it into a <unk> surface.
It's really not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly objects, which we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem realistic as realistic and I think they're those in which we don't even know the things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine photographs it's very important to <unk> because otherwise it's wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images they do with these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect being.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that happens because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even did red the house of the top of the island for more <unk>
So to achieve an realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the results can be very beautiful, and at the very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start by showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details -- but the general part.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as a lot of other ones we tend to see, it's a straight kind of line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It would be more intensity, because he writes about paper.
Why are we <unk> technology at scales.
The answer is that if you draw on a regular curve, where, let's say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look at for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a curved curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you have a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology would be as fast as <unk> last morning, we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rate.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years at advance of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't go forever.
You can't hold this change as fast as it goes.
We took one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve. I know how to come up until something totally different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and I ask myself, is what is that new way to adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we are engaged in it.
I remember that the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something going on.
It's a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things over the long term.
The scale of time I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two and millions of years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals.
If we see the way those chemicals are <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think that there is theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, I'd been floating around with oil <unk> with all kinds of chemicals inside.
Some of those oil drops had had a particular combination of chemicals that made them <unk> and so <unk> grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the more <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you have a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, drops that in some way will become better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals -- more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemical lives, very simple, but things are really interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't understand very well these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we will be able to be in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved half a billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed by exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that try to hide the security people from the airport.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread for the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things were very excited about, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information and to communicate information like that cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be forming communities that, in a way, they were together in that -- and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful -- all the individuals in that community would become more and used by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe in the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities -- communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the brain of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not doing more to process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmitting the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit, because I knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit fruit, they ate that fruit of them.
So the fact that the nervous system built these structures of information completely accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea of <unk> in my head.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and we turn it into sound, in sequences of sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now spend similar periods of periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods of <unk> presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings it into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in descent.
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that told them took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> language, and they took less than a million years.
And beyond, as electronics, seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that does its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without scientific advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor on that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't can, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods we don't even understand it.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process operating on the scale of the descent.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these <unk> instructions at random -- running all those programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them.
But one, luckily, he could figure out two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They put those up to the rest.
And now we want the best to bring the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which would be -- children, who are <unk> <unk> and that the children would take the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's try it again.
And we got some mutations in it.
And he tries again and try and bring it to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end of the end, we ended up with programs that are just an absolute perfect way.
In fact, they're a much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to take care of them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they meet the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the security of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he grabs a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, you don't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make design design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than producing normal engineering.
And yet, we don't understand from all the options that exist.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much faster.
It means <unk>
The thing gets faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the <unk> World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 from a <unk> who <unk> 300.
That means the <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who tried to <unk> the first base -- not come to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how they call a 300 <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> <unk>
By the way, that is someone that <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> Ted Williams, the last player from the League <unk> of <unk> to run more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to look at this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have <unk> and they belong to a surgeon that has also a record record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear to be dear to have two arteries <unk> and your family physician is derived to a cardiologist whose record record is <unk>
But you know something?
She is getting a lot better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you believe that you have to be the average of hits for a heart surgeon or <unk> a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> great.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I find myself with the mandate to be perfect.
You never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my most anatomy, <unk> the origin and work <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of medicine in medicine with the impression that if you were going to make everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I would get away from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to join the emergency service service where I worked.
At that moment I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to consult a cardiologist would have been going to go to that patient.
It will inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to relieve the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> water <unk> so I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent him home.
I really made two more mistakes there.
I sent it home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, it would have been able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
And perhaps I didn't want to be a resident to make attention attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I sent her home, I didn't get any attention to a voice in my inside that he said, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that he would go to the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought about and then said with total <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm fine."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was he signed the high, and the ambulance next to the ambulance and they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, that evening.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I went down to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. So I did something I don't do normally, I don't do.
It happened for the emergency emergency service service at home.
And there is another nurse, not what I was talking about was the <unk> lady before, but the other one told me three words, those three words that most medical doctors.
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are -- you know you?
He remembers the patient he sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
They said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
Within an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high <unk> he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> and the ambulance was brought to emergency pressure with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters a lot of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I was just breathing and she was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all its resources.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that he never <unk>
It had a permanent <unk>
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be <unk> to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, he left him go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks later, I was amazed for it and experienced for the first time the shame <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make peace and never more make that error.
It's that embarrassment that leaves a teaching.
The shame embarrassment of which I talk about is what makes us feel very bad inside.
It's that it tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And it felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would <unk> things and made sure that I didn't get me wrong.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he sent it to her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
And slowly that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he opened up the sky and finally came out of the sun. And I wondered if I'd feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if you get to the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, he was an emergency department in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her because I was a little bit <unk>
He <unk> him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he went to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my tour shift, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: <unk> you know?
Remember the patient he saw for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, he didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics by going <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same kind of shame period and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until again and again and over again.
Two times in the same turn of <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of it.
We had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned normal -- a colleague who was checking the patient to <unk> a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to prove it, and I asked my colleague to do it.
I went through it, and when you see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well as well.
But every case I <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself to talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach them this so they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a <unk> party I'm going to talk about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I hope I would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> which make mistakes and those who don't sleep and the ones that I know -- those who have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that start attack that person.
We have the idea that if you're going to try to care about medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal <unk> study and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article I wrote for the <unk> of Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs are in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right in a system where natural infections are more and more, causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian Canadian <unk>
The U.S. Institute was <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is multiplying every two or three years, and we don't have to get us.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow them to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I breath on alcohol and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminated all the patients prone to error, well, won't get anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's already a custom, to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the <unk> <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students would be <unk> down to the head and <unk> saliva and they started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> I could say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where you can do it.
They need a medical culture <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor, the human <unk> you know human, they accept it, and they are not proud of its mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
It will make their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They were doing the mistakes of other people not with the intent of <unk> but in a loving way of support and support for everybody to get away.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a medical doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel too much, but I strive to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
It recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that he says to pick up a half a half a half a day.
Not long ago in a research followed for a week to a group of death presidents in a week to a group of death.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks by these executives and the time they were going to try to make decisions related to these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your election.
They know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we <unk> the way those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> problem.
Thank you.
I was a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> level at least at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked me, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> which came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists they came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different classes.
We had a <unk> <unk> just to the entrance to the store.
We put there <unk> <unk> or 24 flavors different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop to try and try the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60, that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
Here we found the opposite effect.
Where he stopped when I had only been <unk> only three percent of them got to buy <unk>
What you stood up when there was six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, you decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have to be able to be <unk> less is a good thing to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the <unk> problem is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even even though this is not <unk>
Now the subject of the day, financial savings ...
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we see the savings decisions for about a million Americans, in about a million Americans, of this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of money available in savings plans.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had plans to go from two, up to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of money <unk> there were less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that you would offer about 60 <unk> the rate of participation went back to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more options, even in that case, there's unintended consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of options, more people would be able to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As more options, they were more willing to invest in financial market accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, which is that the <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
Are you more likely to pick things less <unk> even though you see them better.
The main reason is that we would have to look at that massive array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, than less than it is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is more and more is that if you decide to be able to get rid of <unk> alternative options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> costs will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> are increased the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> major sales and less costs.
And you know that today's supermarket will offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, they offer about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world is <unk> and it provides only <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato tomato <unk>
In the world savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle better options is the <unk> <unk> the Harvard.
Every Harvard employees are automatically automatically at the bottom of life.
The people who really want to choose -- they give them 20 dollars, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer people in this audience to a holiday holiday with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> All right, whatever is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a catch.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you have more information in the first turn, that in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was real.
Because the images were making it more real.
And this brings me to the second technique to handle this <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the implications must feel very much <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more at average at average when they use debit cards or credit than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem any real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive for them.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting in which they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we did exactly as a <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we had to do was we gave the staff to the staff that would think about the positive things that they would fit in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket o'clock in the <unk> <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different types of different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two frames of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This framework is completely useless.
The categories should tell you something to <unk> not the <unk>
You can often see this problem with those huge <unk>
I'm supposed to know who they're <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows it completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color of the car. It's 56 possibilities.
<unk> box -- four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order of the order of the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from many options, 56 colors, a few four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> 56 colors, many options.
And what about <unk>
How much do you are.
If you get <unk> always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from many choices to <unk> <unk> the <unk> button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where the information is presented.
If we start with it, you learn to <unk>
Even if you pick the box of changes doesn't say nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we are building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or to people who will work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful you are in our own choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years we went in the East <unk> in the East <unk> if you had a typewriter that I had to write out of the government.
You had to register a piece of text text with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is <unk> freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes them own and from your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you see what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> of the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret secret service about two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say it's more likely to be more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong in worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of suicide <unk> that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them, <unk> they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a strong role in the attacks attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who make it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the national and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an automatic authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the bottom last fall because of a <unk>
It will make security security and make a <unk>
Last week, I asked him in a meeting with government representatives and asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people who had the attack to <unk>
And the answer to him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do we do the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they would take a foreign authority to foreign authority.
And they would give birth <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of the citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 100,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company <unk> is right here.
That is, Western governments provide tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by officers of the German government to investigate its own citizens.
If you are suspected in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
<unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this, the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but I don't really affect it because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we really could trust our governments today, in 2011, any right that we have today will be forever.
<unk> blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones they killed by the night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
They were dying, they protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So he killed lions.
This is one of the six lions they killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for livestock livestock and this was the same thing about me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of fear.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because even helping lions to see the pen away.
I don't want to be <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, and they said, this thing doesn't go here.  So I went and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with which to turn out and turn the lights out.
And this is a little lamp.
They get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the box box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- the lions had killed me, and he asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of fun.
And my idea is also used by the entire Kenya, for frightening other predators like Galileo <unk> and it's also using to <unk> elephants from farms.
So because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant from one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in meadows of the savanna the cows of my father, and he used to see planes fly, and he said that someday it would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now like my invention is saving cows of my father and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting you can listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric invention in other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a little bit of <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that we were invented growing up, but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it once, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I couple because I got a <unk>  CA: When I got a <unk>  CA: Al cannon. You're a big thing.
We're going to <unk> in every single step that I'm going to make my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When you would do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very rich.
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms by looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end of a million Koreans died during famine and only a few survived they survived grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more prone to energy bills, all around me was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture from North Korea at night compared to the African countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes I see bodies floating on the river, in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives community.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to come back together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee camps.
But I soon learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible manifest back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> me on the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then my skills was in the Chinese language and asked me so many questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape a lot of other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragedy that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work -- all of your world can be <unk> at a moment.
That's why, after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to be able to put in the South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with a pride with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, and I made a plan. I started studying for the university exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities were taking some money that sent to my family, and how my family was going to be transferred to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
And I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border to North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to take it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and it was almost caught several times.
Once our bus was arrested and approached by an official police officer.
He asked them all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in <unk> capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come and go between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind questions.
With my poor English and a dictionary -- I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Korea, and to get them from prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why would you <unk>
"I'm not <unk> she told me.
"I am helping the village people.
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the people who are <unk> when you get more <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the cult of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English practice of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact with family contact, still inside, and we send information and money to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America, an opportunity to thrive an international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is Center, <unk> shops of <unk> food, fast <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center name for it to represent something else, so they changed it to the Southern Los Angeles -- as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  -- <unk> of <unk> food, <unk> <unk>
Just like millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles and Southern Chile, home from the food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring more people out of food than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
And I would try to see this happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home you see the <unk> effects, that the food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs from <unk> and sold as a car <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this should stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of taking 45 minutes back to back and back to buy an apple that has no pesticide have.
What I did, was plant a water forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 times three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes me in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's what I decided to do.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we got together and we started planting our forest of food, trees, <unk> trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a group paid by <unk> made of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then somebody gets sick.
The city got me on top and in summary they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, and the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on right?
A court order, by plant food on a piece of land that no one would be <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's do it."
Because this time was not going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and he spoke to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more terrain.
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant -- millions of <unk> plants.
Why don't you look like this?
Let's take a plant -- 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. It would be my children there.
I was afraid to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees and the trees, are my <unk>
You can see what the Earth can do, if they let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is <unk> and how does people affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a mass of education, of transformation from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They are trying to see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most precious act, and provocative act can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember once a mother and his daughter, and they were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they were looking very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt embarrassment when I saw people who was so close to me, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> I don't temes that people would go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh God no, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another time when I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of these are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and the body, eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're sitting, and I see kids in this way that are designed for them, which doesn't lead them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you get the next George Washington Post.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk> healthy.
Don't get me up.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, get the guys out of the street, who know the joy, pride and pride and honor to cultivate their own food, opening markets.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Does it take your <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is their gun to choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, they don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some of them to talk about doing shit.
If you want to see it, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
It Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>   You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as it goes a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go parallel to your bike and these cars go over, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, have pores and the water can go through it, so all the water of rain flow up to the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't have a road that is easy to drive, and no longer <unk>
The noise also will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very plants, all noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the stones on the surface of the surface.
First, a stone, then a stone, and more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, it won't do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can see what the damage is in this material.
It's the asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light of the light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if you're going to be <unk> they're going to be thrown out of the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you will get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, of that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool and the steel and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of fleece in it.
Then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use to make a <unk> machine.
The <unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> by these <unk> and the stones will come back to the surface.
Today I used to be a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great machine of <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to get now to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> in which we had to make a set of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of load on them, the ones then with our machine <unk> and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fibers of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, even you can even increase the life of the road, you can even save the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, it has to cool first before I can show you how it acts in the form.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
The Taliban was like, 'I <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban was <unk> from Afghanistan and they made illegal to be in school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could not be alone outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market bags so it looks like we were <unk>
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we would <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in the time, the school was suddenly moving for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan -- in which his daughter, my mother, to go to school and so his father would <unk>
But my mom became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not raising their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always is to be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want to not be <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the school, and if my family had been not as committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in college College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't only <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who drove him on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the same, even in front of a opposition opposition, <unk>
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from the way to her village, and they were literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you get the phone, a voice told him that if I kept sending your daughter to school, they would try.
<unk> already, if you <unk> he said, "but I won't harm the future of my daughter by their old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and this is something that it's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people -- there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they often are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so I think these changes didn't have a lot after retirement of the U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I went back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were talking about them, I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future, and a lasting shift.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I'd never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back to a revolutionary style <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution, inspired by the wavelength of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> in and out of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women, and young men were <unk> they were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East <unk> to the west to the south.
Finally, after a <unk> period.
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved -- along with many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> <unk> and a fair transition to democracy and <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about developing human development and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women, we started the <unk> of Women Women <unk> for the <unk> a movement of women, leaders, in very <unk> orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation <unk> in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period.
Over time, our initiative.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, a little bit of recently, the elation of elections and the revolution like a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of officials of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made up by a revolutionary mindset, they become more removed from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the revolution.
I'm not here at all to <unk> with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I am here today to tell you that we, as a nation, we choose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't do it.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> so much for men in women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than what I needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the female depiction of the female more than to need the depiction of <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting it into practice <unk> instead of charge, the collaboration rather than competition, the inclusion instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war desperately needs to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> which is <unk> which is all the humanity that men and women -- of which all tribes and all the people and all villages have gone on.
And so, just like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of existence.
So he says, "My mercy is <unk>
So he says, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a question -- which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence and the question I'm going to address is that they all do very much. Why is she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, and I don't have an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. At the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed in my soul <unk> I would take me to my head with a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a Protestant <unk> <unk> of love, where you fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It even could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a <unk> in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all race, all of religions, every income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence goes to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relationships and long duration or said in another way, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> reason for which, domestic abuse, <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who was going on with a man who does it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States of between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and <unk> night night.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> university and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most struck by that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had a lot of <unk> <unk> and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
So we started coming out and loved all of me, that he was ready to go to Harvard, who had been passion to help girls teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and thinking.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and a woman, like anyone had ever done before.
And it was why I know that the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his future of a brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and to leave my job of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, and so I decided to let me my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering a physical trick, financial and a very friendly psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how they react it.
And here is where you go into the scene that <unk>
As we moved to New England you know, that site where it is supposed to be so safe to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another guy was laid under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma for the trauma that lived in tiny.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted me my hand, my life, my life was in serious danger, every single day.
The first <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit, and I married him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we lived in happy forever, because I loved him, and he loved him a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
I just had very much sense of <unk> by the wedding and for the fact to form a family with me.
It had been an isolated crash, and I never would make any more harm.
I spent two times more in our <unk>
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> me, and he gave me so hard in the head that we would <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, and he would go through traffic and threw a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> he went to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only in this situation.
One of every three American women is victim of domestic violence or <unk> in some time in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So going back to my question: Why do I tell me?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question all the world does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't I get <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people do people, because we gave us the victims, we know something that normally you are <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has gone to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, and <unk> of financial resources, and it manipulation from the family court system to <unk> to the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time with the man who supports his mother.
And yet we keep asking why they just don't go?
I was able to go to it -- because of one last <unk> he will beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if there was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world -- to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family friends, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims like headlines, <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people who are a way to say "The fault of <unk> as if the victims of <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to be <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that they will save their lives joyful lives, joyful and happy lives -- women and mothers, completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence, very typical violence.
I became marrying a guy cute and kind of <unk> and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I will not have ever got to have ever ever got to have ever before, is a <unk> gun to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, the same way you're thinking, "This is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all of this time I've actually been talking about you.
I promise you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting your daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need all over the world.
We need each of you understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They get the access to the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues of work, their friends and family.
<unk> their view of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe basis.
Together we can convert our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of insurance and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress up like this.  luckily, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when you <unk> they don't have to get them right now, but I find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as you cover my head.
All right.
Why did I've done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about myself in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he <unk> his back and <unk> the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, even as shallow <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, "I was <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made me model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what is this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as well as youth and symmetry and symmetry, which we're biologically hardwired to <unk> also we have associated with a high and <unk> shape, to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I have known to take to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that you're going to <unk> Hold on, and there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of models. It's surprising.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only -- I mean, less than four percent, they weren't white ...
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then what I would really say to each one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> chief of American American magazine or the <unk> executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that the older you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be older.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike surgery <unk> can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have you cut your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs to your backs, no matter what you want, you know, if you want to be president of the United States, but you have your <unk> <unk> Model underwear for 10 years, people would look very weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and at <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me on those pictures.
They are <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> for free?
I have too many five inches high and I never use, except for the couple before, but the privileges I get to get away in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to follow <unk>
I think of these privileges because I look like this, not why I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for what they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of the <unk> teenage girls who were couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino young women in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I <unk> And so on.
By researching this talk, I found out that for 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes down to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you're going to feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people and clever and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what it happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my mind every day.
And if you ever ask it, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair, will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs, the brightest hair and the <unk> clothes, but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion for me to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't get myself who <unk>
There was no <unk> directors and no chance to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum minimum in the lighting light.
In fact, most people took random tourists in fact.
My story starts when, in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture by holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk>
He went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what it comes now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
Never no one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five girl could be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop the time in October week, and we would think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive it and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, on one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in dry and pointed out of a red <unk> of the dolls of dolls that <unk> in small visits in the previous stage.
And he described to me what had felt about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York now is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of active engaging in creating conscious memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes a picture.
Today I want to encourage everybody to come in the picture, and they don't get to get up to somebody and asked him, and it takes me a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special set of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, as silly stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause, and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the clean environment,  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And so my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World Bank <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 students face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important -- first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural <unk>
It takes the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax than they would not be because they would stretch and cause big losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times longer in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge practical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High <unk> and in <unk> Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a lot of important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead to the dead and wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being superior, is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In Southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by veterinarian in India and have taken a stance.
Because there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb, to <unk> The number of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a living problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can become active -- make noise. You can write a letter to your government, and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> <unk> <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed it because he saw them fly without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young -- but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa de <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, which Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would call it out.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with the seeds of <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they don't <unk>   We were even aware that the local people in so fertile -- they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we did not invent anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  <unk> for saving the people in Zambia of the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is grown <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought we only had the Italians to do mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, were doing what the <unk> were doing and then to see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's look at the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we will give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western political countries, we have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat anybody in a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I treat all of them of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to go to the 27 years to answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never count anyone, but becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> the <unk> of the local <unk>
So what do you? Do you?
He has never got a community with an idea, and he sits with the people of the <unk>
We didn't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We came together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give it an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we help us find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, why do not, for one time, they will tell them, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have you to <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't even go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We do we do one to one, and we work on face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is a family doctor, the family family family physician sets with you in your house, at the table on your kitchen table, and that helps it to find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this <unk> junk where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you <unk> And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And -- and so --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business veteran in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
The planning is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you for sure, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they will come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What is you going to show you more than this tomorrow?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurship is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution, <unk> fossil revolution, and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that was in a futuristic journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York in the year <unk>
And in the year -- there was this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't be there in 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic <unk> and you have to have a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't born.
We have research and looked at the 100 companies icons in the world -- <unk> Sir Ford, all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when she began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a little bit of a small business environment in <unk> in bars in bars with their peer-reviewed devoted who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what would you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it. Can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." You want to <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't think much of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much are my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories from our abandoned buildings, and understanding our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for cows for cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant bush <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city of a city.
And there is a <unk> in New <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one of the most beautiful properties of the U.S. properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a stronger space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this led to me a profound gratitude for time and lived for life.
It gave the significant things about my current life.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to be easy to be able to be able to get on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall from this left house on a giant <unk> and he painted about it sentences to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> and reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk> --  Before I die from <unk> I want to sit on the line of change <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
He tried to die -- I want to make it a more."
Before I died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space has become <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at me, <unk> me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving us the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the center of civic center, we did a kit and now have been walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
Cancer is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that will become more power.
It's going to think about death, our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, they can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I would like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
Don't speak -- but it gets better joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and look at this: it's never <unk>
When I sing from our childhood, trying to speak the words that I can't even survive, it reminds me remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember whether he stole my <unk> but he remembers the year when I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, being pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what he pushed my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests a different shape, so that it's going to be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, we're going to be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that the faster development is going to increase in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I can't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new way in my life.
When you spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the machine, looking at the washing machine and eat anything there would be <unk>
As I was growing up more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child that looked at the world without <unk> a human being had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by high beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could put one thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, it would be normal to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a strategy of communication -- that gave a kind of communication to engineering students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of fact, <unk> of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big unknown and unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it would have had to have felt like when he fell through the hole in the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenge, from energy to environment, and health care between others, and if we don't know about this, we don't understand this, and I think it's our responsibility for us to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
What is science is relevant to us.
They don't tell us that you just study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to do it.
And when they're describing their science, careful with the <unk>
The slang is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein, which everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his job, forget about the signs of <unk>
So you've asked why they're called <unk>  What are the bullets doing? <unk> killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only one of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that we will <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what you get.
I think these are just some key key to help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words across the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
It's simply because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor for the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that looks for a public charge of no matter or <unk> platform or principle, and that, when he <unk> it gets it by the mere use of monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something about the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and all the politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
He was thrown in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and policy interact, I want you to get back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> of State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the United States <unk>
Not quite <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was a quality.
And they didn't even have the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed degree.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired of them, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of <unk> was against <unk>
The <unk> House didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it a King for if he would give him to him or his boy, ideas.
And so they wanted to give it the most precious <unk> title that you have happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was already existed before, but it just meant <unk> that I would take a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a <unk> degree.
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a ridiculous title as ridiculous as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama has to stay there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you that the title of President of America doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 warheads at disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed at the title of <unk>
So eventually he won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, looks like, well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the <unk> House <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually actually change the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and powder and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear some voices who talk about but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap woman out of light, he touches her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of the branches that hold up the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
And I was <unk> my hand and suddenly remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and fell down <unk> feet in that body.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole to risk their lives without paying reward, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and, in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
And among all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not about this degree.
When we ended up talking to me, I was very sad -- I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me up to me, the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
A few of them were considered my second home.
But this time, we would play the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as double as many displaced Africans during the entire slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a desperate slave was about three times the annual wage.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, today you can afford entire families by generations per generations per capita <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake good education promises and better work to then find out they are forced to work without paying under threat from violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
The slavery exists around the world and, however, it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met a brick <unk>
This strange, odd show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees old, men, women, children, in fact, a heavy families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> recruiting them mechanically bricks in their heads to 18 at the time, and they bring them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> work silent, doing this task over and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no chicken to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made that even pee out of <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot to touch it, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry -- but the <unk> that I was at my side quickly, grabbed me and said, <unk> don't <unk> Don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I could not offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not the citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system by their liberation and trusted that they would do it.
As I waited to get home to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found children wearing stones for miles on <unk> <unk> to trucks to expect down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who died and the kids would put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had <unk> their houses.
When you hear the word slavery we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness they warned me, that would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It took me for a little bit <unk> that gave this <unk> basement <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local for prostitution, <unk>
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall, divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From standing in <unk> I remember making sense of a fear of <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be trapped in that hell.
I had only one <unk> the stairs where I was going.
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no windows as big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as slaves to sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that we often relate to <unk> labor.
He went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of the silk.
This is a portrait of family.
The black hands of black hands are the father, the blue <unk> of the blue and the red of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 kids are estimated in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came there, I was going to have a quick look at it.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, some younger kids have felt right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their Roma families and they were forced to work <unk> long in these boats in the lake, even though they didn't know swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was <unk> I know that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees in Lake <unk> in Lake <unk> often catch networks and kids, and with fear, they become the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of people are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love it's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when we were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one in the time.
On the cold night and <unk>
And I would make it point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
It took a road in Ghana in Ghana with <unk> partners -- the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his container <unk> with a sudden <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to do it by a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started down, we took out the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as they <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in one of us, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied to their backs and as they were looking for gold -- they were going to be in hot water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These mining are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the fish they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry together heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area in which they had the rock to extract the gold to extract the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see to work at least lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle is the force to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors were saying it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream about being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, in face to a remote, remote, which inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them and we're going to do everything we can to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of magazines. They are of people, real, real people, like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I'm going to happen I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them -- in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn a fire and that that fire will make light out of slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management fields.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try and try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
And we would give us the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we will see later.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably a certain set of <unk> that you can well have a genetic component that well.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, <unk> gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a desperate dancer dance.
Over the last few years has made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and, ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement of movement have no <unk> and so they don't have the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam these <unk>
They wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, you have no conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string strings.
It shows you a healthy person as it emits sounds by talking, we can imagine this as dancers of a vocal voice, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the necessary genes to produce the sounds for example.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal ropes as <unk> and as well as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the organs.
On the bottom of you can see an example of the irregular shake of string strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> Well, but but <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
It's cost cost and we all know what happens here.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce our patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for the routine.
With high-speed monitoring we could get goals.
We could make a massive amount of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving you today the first steps in that sense, we're releasing the <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or without Parkinson's disease, you can call it low price and let me take recordings of a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So he would take all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you will be able to say who is healthy and who not?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to tell you if you have or not the heart of it?
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> it may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in search of the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have an precision <unk> at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work and now has been shown that it works in the mobile phone network, too, which is the project -- now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We're creatures <unk>
We are focusing on the dark, in rooms without windows and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models -- even more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do the impossible, possible for us to be able to do it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a true taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where it was <unk> there was the place working on the place working as part of the team of response.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May <unk> traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons of tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and cameras and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places in the villages of around to <unk>
It wasn't until then, I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the village.
It helped clean the toilets, the huge, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of them and I had the honor of that day in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard about the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until over myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get it very precision and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of the time, they came up with some more pictures and they needed more <unk> so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk> from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village neighbor to northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in libraries of temporal libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent on <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. I could do a couple of weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using it as a guide areas whose color and detail the water had no destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered from bacteria, with algae, even with oil -- all of it along with the time time I continue to be <unk> by that hand -- it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't get the photo unless I was clean, dry and would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We tell the guidance of a <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the pictures already <unk>
As a <unk> once <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to talk to the photos.
And he had begun to <unk> her but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I collected their pictures shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures on a fire station, between the rubble of the rubble of the rubble of a lot of where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in the middle schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find his family and know that they were all surviving.
The day he gave her pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, these pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could come back to look, something that I could remember from the past that had never been labeled on the day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there. <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean them out of <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the great majority came to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world have helped us give us back to 90 families hundreds of photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We took photos constantly.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They're <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would bring us in, but the first thing we would try to look for.
This was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone to their connection to the past.
When a picture is giving someone, a huge difference in the life of the person who comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger and put something, using their talent to something that they are not using thin skin models.
I would like to read this email. I would like to read this <unk> I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
And one in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me, because a similar picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, <unk> from our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in a single exhibition of one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and seeing the world not a million or a billion, but a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion into motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> of the vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray and challenging the idea of <unk> and defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser laser and turn it off, and it turns out, in a <unk> <unk> in various <unk> create a pack of photons of just a millimeter millimeter away.
And that set of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a commons.
If we take that bullet and this pack of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how they disperse those photons inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all of this --    -- remember, all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to light light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a set of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces it inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it go the same distance and we see it at slow down to about 10 billion times, how much think it would take us to be sitting at that movie?
A day? A week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring film --  from a Slow bullet in motion.
And what about testing <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that go off the table, the tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of course.
But if you look at it once you look more and more of this -- you will realize that, as the light is <unk> in the <unk> it's still brilliant.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces back into its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to <unk>
So why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture to low exposure, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go through a billion times faster than the shortest show of exposure -- so you can just go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> and we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of the door on the door. You would go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to
We could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall, there's a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different moments in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to what a distance.
As a laser project a laser can record a picture at <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that would take collisions with what's going on the curve, on the curve.
Or we could look at survivors at dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and the blood that is pretty difficult, so this is actually a order to scientists so they start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization in the next generation.
So as a <unk> <unk> He turned science in art, a art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collected every time is not just for scientific views.
To create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and <unk>
And let's look at those waves Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going to leave us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes appears in the camera.
We have the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against the humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone you can record a song, and she can put it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people come up in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all of these people gathering it to be able to look for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who on the hand has a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's too much -- almost everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about me, from my cellphone, and what changed life changed.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 different information lines.
information.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European company company -- every single Internet provider from all Europe, has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers, and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, <unk> journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came up to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some people were told that this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Art.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is why I was asking me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to him, and I didn't get a concrete response -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make it a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end of the end, you get a agreement.
They demand demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 lines.
I first saw them, and I said, well, it's an enormous file.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, "I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open came out of this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and stop, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> in the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a bit scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other, what time they call each other, what time they do to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sent an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives and want to break it forever.
But the <unk> and live in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's no longer anymore.
When you go home to your school that only because companies and government agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that you can remember you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one's <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It's only about accidents, as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you in there.
I feel bad for me, because at some time in life, you have a disabled person.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas are in the mall, drive in circles and search for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> and I'm a <unk> and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first one.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters were older <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system and get away from me, and if we didn't drink all the ultimate note all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and simply walking.
The other approach that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would do it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a literary losing, which has received many <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 centimeters, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
The people who grew up had no problem with my faith.
But it seemed to be <unk> so much that dying of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that it had enough fat to live three months without eating, so I <unk> from dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, on <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I would spend my summers back into a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we weren't going to come back to Palestine all the <unk> we would love them in <unk>
On the summer holiday I often tried my father trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk -- so I would put me hot cups on the back, I would put me in the Ross Sea, and I remember the water and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that he couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a grant for the University of the Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
And all of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I pulled the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> <unk> in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk>
I have cerebral <unk>
By the end of the end of the end of the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running on the director of the theater department crying and historically, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, and I asked him why and she told me that because they thought I could not make the stunt stunts <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts -- you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for which he was literally born and was given to an actor.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated home, and my first tour tour -- it was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> who did not be <unk> actors, no white with disability.
We just appealed to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, I took all famous comics from New York to New York, and I never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he was at the top of the New Jersey <unk> with a driver I had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East and <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival in New York, now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media media, and I will remind you to <unk> <unk> who <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the stigma challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program by invited back to the cable back with Keith <unk>
I walked as if I went to a graduate dance, I would join a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I marched to the desk on the speaker to not come out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like <unk> at full time and pasted my chair.
Something funny I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never would have a little girl and no longer as a child.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
You use online clips online, like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What is it?
We really should pray for it.
A guy suggested that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't do someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the more <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
And yet, we have grown up with media, I don't think it will be.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday lives.
Maybe if there was more positive images -- that will be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in a depiction of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugee kids, a little bit of what my parents would <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me act in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a young people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small village to South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
The drought drives the small people to poverty and the brink of <unk>
No one for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, there is no job, no sense of future.
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year of maybe a year <unk>
One day you get about a guy who offers to bring it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to her family.
I show a young boy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky destroyed a bomb.
That little boy from that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for a opportunity, hoping to start her future, waiting for a brain perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> in London, who are looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs -- well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism.
And in my city of birth, 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work on school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital Hospital.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if he had been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few juvenile leaders in a business level.
It was about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me that because it was a graduate graduate college -- frustrated, it was the perfect target for Al <unk> and other AIDS organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get about to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes at local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think their ability to identify and take a new chance.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that the spirit will be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
We will encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so desperately for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attending one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of the business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted a flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from the <unk>
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding by creating gardens in houses, and the city companies -- and now he's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO to work for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe they might be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So inspire young people and creating a culture of spirit culture, it's really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need to have expertise and orientation to <unk> in development of their business.
They would bring young people to the resources they need, <unk> the support they need to move from understanding to the creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
To me, the spirit of business is something more to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
Their Park, of <unk> that's how it calls it when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep them to keep them to keep them to keep them.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to make the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks <unk> which <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the <unk> <unk> area in the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not being the way that we could almost <unk> that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with view of a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts and apple balls.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had <unk> who they thought I was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our garbage in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the clean <unk> Department of <unk> of 11 metric metric tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know people as individuals.
I wanted to understand who makes that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and interviewed people in offices and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but was still a <unk>
I needed to go further up.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now not just was traveling in the trucks.
And operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as well as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get to quickly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and they go sideways around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck.
And I also learned about the steal of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a breath or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I think strongly that the <unk> of waste is the most important work in the streets of town, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent to care in very real ways.
And so we had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and come back to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we have no space for what the motors of the economy are actually starting to fail when it is in harm's way.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed of the average speed necessary.
I mean, just at the speed of which we used to move to move in the time.
We usually don't have any <unk> and we have no <unk> and we have our coffee cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side which is about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help to reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us except for ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
And one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste on the street, grabbed my son, little son, and I grabbed the steps on running the steps around and there was a man who was doing his way out of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her to do his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
Let's be okay.
Shortly after that I started to research the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together and we did good friends.
I want to believe it was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts of <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account for all the cost, even the very actual human cost of labor.
The city waste, what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the <unk> of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean the junk of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our communal life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally about conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are a lot of the city in the city we realized that there are three important aspects of <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large shops where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to spend a lot of energy because the <unk> coating generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And third, it looks like nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile worth of such a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure of open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to make external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site, which is located in a lot of a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not existed.
And it's also among two parallel streets, they don't communicate in a hundred meters of size.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs of the building.
And this extends out with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space open space in the building that is rooted in its own form, of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that will encourage local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of a concrete compound with <unk> to allow the air, and also of light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we inspired ourselves in these beautiful buttons of the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the building of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't really easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what they <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall because of the commercial center there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was significantly more economic not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut up almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the ceiling as a new public space with meeting areas and bars that would create this urban oasis of <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, that they collect water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a teacher in 2000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the bigger I have designed, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I made a special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> which was surrounded by a 12 <unk> doors connected to the lines of the straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first operating operation we did was extend the streets in existing streets, creating 12 early blocks which are similar to size and characteristics that are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points of strategic dots in relation to the idea of the gates with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we would build a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community up to the construction community by building it.
It's where all of the neighbors, you can get up and <unk> and make such as a running run in two kilometers in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives will change communities and local economies at the same rate that grow buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had a very bright little tiny hair and a little <unk> <unk> cute. It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of drought, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I became a time after the middle of the school, I was a little evening, and I hid in the bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I was in the classroom, I took the table of my teacher to the book grades.
And then I did.
I put up the ratings <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All like this, and I set up to bring up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them out of <unk> and myself a row in a row -- just to be there, because I was going to be there.
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk>
I never got to me.
But most of all, I get rid of the reason why I was bothered by that this little little little girl was so nice to <unk>
I get the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the birds are <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all of their potential forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there wouldn't be the literature.
Well there wouldn't be <unk> <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There are no <unk>
I read the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No one's not <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as you can have all of them.
This year is 100 years of his work in <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> my God, all we could have.
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that picture.
We forget about how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the residents who are reduced to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a good narrative base -- <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel deserts, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
And as an <unk> and audience, we know exactly what a little bit about <unk> to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> make all of these <unk> novelists -- and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> are like large amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> <unk> the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of childhood soon listening behind the door and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then they secured those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real monetary value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> are a search for knowledge, search of the truth, a real truth, in fact, to be able to <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who makes us suffer, it causes us to have a range of feelings much deeper and vital than a wise man that would be able to protect us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think he's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look very <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
A day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, who was not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, not realizing it <unk> behavior.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> are going to look with intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are bringing us to making violent <unk> or illegal.
<unk> are going to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years, I <unk> But I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years old was captured by having created a fake story on Facebook from which they would send messages <unk> to itself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> to the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What huge -- even though you would have creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel with Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to do our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of differences, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> at a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to get from your self and get it out of what you ever did, and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your <unk> cow your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road from Tom <unk>
I can't give you all around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in the time.
We live in jealousy.
That is, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
The novels show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinks about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always said <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief head of rat <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs <unk> genius -- but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but we would break it up and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> you walk in, all with your solution, <unk> back back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> I don't want to throw your hands up.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is great. Right?
They seem to treat them as a problem of geometry, not excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
For the next minute you are at the same way.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It might still be so simple.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get them from the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> the jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21, of July 1969, 1969, Aldrin jumped out of the Duke of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea, the <unk>
Armstrong and traders were themselves, but their presence on the surface of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
Apollo took work for about 400,000 people and asked 20 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which death after death rate last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 minutes later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some people ask, why did the <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why do you scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why will you fly on the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're tough.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> at the equivalent of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
landing on the moon happened in a context of a long <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and it was eliminated the smallpox.
Technology looked like what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle ship, but in 1969, the crew crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles -- / hour.
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew crew of Apollo 10, and the Buddhist optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> by seeing that the problems we imagined that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the population population seem to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't belong to the <unk> escape <unk> from the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely confident that I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that doesn't happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard about the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists were <unk> and they were enriched them with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't get the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation <unk> in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which <unk> Intel and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs of the risk offer communities.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of the risk caused us to <unk> creation of ideas by taking care of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk of risk, they preferred small investment investment, which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of development and whose development is in the long term.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like sunlight, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic up.
The coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price, they don't exist.
Now, technologists, business and economists agree to be aware of what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the <unk>
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see a energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, they have not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can make things like harvest it or systems for storage and food systems, but there will be famines as you existed.
Finally, the big problems we sometimes have a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was given to the war in 1971, in 1971, we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant types of treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and <unk> but these four elements are going to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must be able to support the <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it meets with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like how to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be easy.
I was only three days.
And really, I was not even going to have no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to start with you: the ideas you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover confidence.
I think <unk> the goal and the task has been wrong with it.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> an objective and a task, which I think gives you a clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow up to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that might have increased others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to the surveys of view, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty <unk> for the poet for the music of the time.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost seen in the way.
But this evidence is enough?
What the opinion opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you look at are the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they do certain questions.
They were in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
They were in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for the question, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very scary answer.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official <unk> officer or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all the cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give you the class of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but not, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real confidence, because they try to get the good judgment to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I want to have more confidence in which it's trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what is not <unk>
And I think those people who are saving their savings with the very <unk> Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> either either with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it -- he says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to do a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible for us we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the post, because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure you can do certain things, but I see that they will <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to have to do today before we trust.
trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability and accounts for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and so on, that they made us easier for people to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the Greek <unk> I would go on on <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we would argue that the system of accountability that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the test evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You've probably all of you know similar examples.
They were doing all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you will be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and whether to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
You know, to the task we rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is defining because we give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You've got to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it, usually all the time.
But you also have to be able to have the evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes a day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where my socks buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving explanations.
I take them up and get me back money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have trust you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since early computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination is <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more than a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes deeper into digital space, so that when the strong line against the screen is transfers to the <unk>
The designers can tell us their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool is broken the barriers.
But the two hands still remain on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of your hands?
In the Science division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
It would be a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of 3D space and grab pixels straight with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space -- <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book, and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is below every floating screen.
The architects can spread or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We had a lot of a lot of us will have bought and turning things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make these physicists so that we can make it <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel alone.
This imam <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which implies that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and get back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and a distance and the famous thing about Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality of the times that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is most fascinating about changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world will change our everyday activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without us to get them from our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that remains our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to give him to a school for athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
And after they survive the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was just a tough path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter what I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer which was Chinese opera.
This was me, in my <unk>
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to the opera school.
I had to wrote to the director of the school and the guy on a radio show.
But no adult would give him the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life -- a second <unk> happiness would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look at another <unk>
Nobody was around me, I wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> it's about <unk> Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a lot of <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but a strange one.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this trap. guilt trap.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my <unk> <unk>
You know, a lot of perspectives.
For example, the beginning this map seemed to me that it was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading isn't something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There's all the way to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that the comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual economics.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of miss in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that Chinese Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people of the past and the present.
I know I won't come back to feeling alone or powerless ever.
Having a dream dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that understanding is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a dream dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch of my office and took off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I played a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex led me to the <unk> it became easy to move their head as they <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work after, you start home, you have children later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like he was going to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe he went on with the next.
Also, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream a <unk> I want to see. All the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that give her life to be able to be in order to have 30 and <unk>
People of over 40, you don't get to panic.
This public is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of the Americans are married, they live or come up with their future couple at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it was <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change in themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> that in any other time of life, and we know that the fertility fertility comes to its top at 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to <unk> over their body and their options.
When we think about development development, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your day-to-day life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
Researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists named <unk> names <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Cohen was saying that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think about when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens to absolutely absolutely nothing.
And then all of the days, bloody intelligent, interesting things like you or their children get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be well."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better remember the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
Everybody ran up and <unk> but then somewhere around the 30, it turned the music and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person who was going to be stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to 30 percent, and so many of them start a career, choosing a city, choosing a partner, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show you, which is much harder and stressful to make everything from once to the <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in their own words, having an identity.
He said you would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> that ambition.
And even though of living very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she got up she would say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she came his head on his legs and I cried during almost the entire time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning and I had spent the whole morning, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after words and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who will be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of me if you give me a <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like I worked with Alex as I was just sitting in the time of Emma going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that it was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity of identity.
By capital capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates identity of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
And I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you the airport, but the <unk> who get together with friends with similar minds limited to who you know, what you know, how you know, how do you think about, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes out of the outside of its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak ties friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the way we got to get this group.
Half the work that has never been <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job in a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
The last one, but not less important, Emma believed that you don't choose their family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as soon as Emma was going to go back to his family.
I told Emma the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit on my mind than 20 or even 25 or maybe 25 or maybe I agree with you.
But choose to the person who you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so <unk> in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead to do it instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who would bring them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in the room of a cousin who was working in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That works of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with which I lived with.
Now, five years later, it's a special <unk> of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the space of doctors are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out from the airport from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land or in <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, at the same way, at the same way, a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next years or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea of spreading all the people that know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their own identity, use their weak bonds -- choose your family.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management consulting for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach the mathematics of seventh grade in the public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I used tests and evidence.
Let me make tasks.
When I work back, I went down grades.
What struck me is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance, had no scores of <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And so that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to university to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Atlantic <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are <unk> as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in slums. What teachers are still going to be teaching for the end of school year and <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the results of the learning of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, question, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those contexts, very different contexts -- a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physics and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve long-term targets.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years, working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a good career.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my feelings of determination and then waited about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination they had significantly higher chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> tests, even the security results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little people know about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination in the children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethical <unk>
How do we keep motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What do you know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly not related or it's even related to the urgency of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to challenge, they are much more prone to <unk> when you get to them, because they don't believe that it will be a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to try to start to start to start to start all again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
I was in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
So from that moment, I was amazed for this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you might want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An academic, Chinese academic 20 thousand characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy in it.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature, long enough to read signs of traffic <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the pages or the paper.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you could until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the way it's called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As you say the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a browser like <unk> inside the whale inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a tree speaker is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two things together, it becomes very hot.
Three things together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together are <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn for a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun with the beginning, because Japan is in the east of China.
So a sun next to each other, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a <unk>
A mouth that tells you where it is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I come to see.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we bring our children into a kind of industrial complex show of child experience.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film -- a metal boy and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk> <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of the Oz and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if the magician, do you do today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of Oz like the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat magical shoes to defeat the military <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the magician of the Oz is that the most prestigious characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to see this when I did "Star <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And so he was so slid in the room, and he was very impressed as a mom foot with her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It would be the sense that Luke get a army to <unk> the government?
This is <unk> with the magician of <unk>
How do it win Dorothy his movie?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with, OK? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there as much strong capital strength in the movies for our children, and so little of the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that "The princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss.
My search is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though them, boys, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of every time continues to go back in classic at classic every one of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who earn a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted in the roots and it would be <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a book of comics, and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the evaluation of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to play the <unk>
These women talk about each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid that you like to like   All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie. In fact, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- a sense of consensus from what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
<unk> doesn't happen the test test.
And I don't think it's going to be <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis of <unk>
We have lots of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we would go through the numbers.
In 2011, from the most popular films, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said,
One in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or sexuality are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are these <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools to be tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children who are a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the box, is changing radically.
You will have read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite <unk> <unk> <unk> Do you know what I would do.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to encourage them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories when I tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight and get more stories where their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a kid, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for sea cookies, on the shores of Maine, because my parents told me that it would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with the time, I went to <unk>
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized to do with my own eyes, not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, I had grown up to one billion length of length next to the <unk>
And my sea bee had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place in simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process using <unk> color, suddenly the place looks like brilliant.
What you're looking at are the real chemical changes in the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find a old American city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> always have known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this massive <unk> <unk>
This area is enormous -- it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed the time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And so I wanted to find out randomly would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians who are doing <unk> jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation looking for layers of human occupation, we look for layers of human occupation, we look for layers of human occupation, we look for layers of human occupation, we look for layers of human occupation, we look for layers of human occupation, we look for layers
Five meters down, under a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of a number hundreds of years ago that date to the Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs, quartz quartz and <unk> which shows there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry shop which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't have any <unk> here, but we will go into the place in a near near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire that's probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do some ideas actually started in 1984 B.C. C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from high time.
It certainly puts the carbon <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now I would give you a group of obese <unk>
They are competing on a bike bike race and they go in direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
We have bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, <unk> the threshold of the Internet.
And then you get to the lobby, or what there is the next side of the door, and watch the quality of light. The light is shining over the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse talking about.
They can feel your blue <unk> tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you're going to be about to get into the mouth.
Put on one side and enter their living room.
And in the room, and doing most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
She's with little clothes, dancing on their center center, singing <unk> I was <unk> One <unk>
Now I will go to the kitchen.
The soil has been covered with a yellow bricks and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I suppose, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- watch them just once.
They embraced the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
They have entire poems in just a minute.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition they say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old old techniques invented two and years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives and that the <unk> academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful <unk> and brilliant <unk> although a little <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order on a deck of sports in live in national TV.
That will show you the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something wrong.
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can be the potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to be the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that it didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on memory writing about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as you might look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we've changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed their own <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how to do these people.
A few years ago, a group of researchers College London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're really smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the guys of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a different MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and shapes from snow. They found that in the memory champions is <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they looked at <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for competitive competitive is driving as a armed career in where every year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try and memorize an hour to memorize a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the right order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates it with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
So what do you do?"
The person who told him that his name is Baker it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said to her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean for you. It's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
They tried well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you go through that word for the first time, we started putting up <unk> <unk> for <unk> at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates about two thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring to a <unk> they would get to a <unk>
He stood up standing foot, <unk> his memory, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the room of the <unk> <unk>
It will go all around us.
But not only killed them all of us, but it shattered the bodies.
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so they couldn't tell them the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, I closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting on each other.
I took the family family <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What you would have to pick up students at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers, word for word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial <unk>
If I told you, the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to tell you who I was sitting on the horse song, brown <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and look at images with the things that you want to remember -- the crazy things you want to do, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk> to be.
This is a advice.
And how does it work?
Let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from memory, the same way he would have done it, if you had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they turn in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, who is going to confuse it's typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in your memory Council.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory memory and had the idea of writing a lot about this <unk> of competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a golden event.
Seriously, is how to see a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else is <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to wear it in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit in seeing the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was a lot of fun.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's really about doing is to better make more and more the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty quickly with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some security security dioxide covered with tape by leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I was covered in a year before, and I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute being able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize it to benefit from a little bit of insights on how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of a gift -- but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention to.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
They have a sort of deep processing of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not going to be hanging around.
But the reality is there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what you would call the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short <unk> existence is in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking around our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even have to be able to process it in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, and so we would just take it a little bit of <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home of my parents called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody passed out on TV. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, and I all looked at me, and every time I got up with me and I was going to come up in a towel -- all I saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and <unk>
I hate that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, or of division of areas, but of those connections, emotional connections, which we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
That architecture determines us in ways that don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, you know what you would think about you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that this is why they think about this in a building two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a catch.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection to the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because it's really frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
It's the Public Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> has this round thing: There's this nice, Second brick -- which are going to be able to communicate with this <unk> children, stock values history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of these so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new new solutions for new life forms of life.
We would talk about it, and we got them so much, we get away from the people.
And all of black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do it, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we are going to swing the way back to go ahead and over and over and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we had a half years ago from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we got to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols together.
And we were born again in the other direction.
We took those ways that we know and <unk>
And we neon steam and we added a bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't get <unk>
We took <unk> and we turn them in a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes would be <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
No madness.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the slums, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those erotic could be <unk> to the French or <unk>
Maybe with a little bit of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy enough to be cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we started to swing the one again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and in the early '90s, we started to experience the so-called <unk>
We have the <unk> symbols we now have new design design techniques, and we find new ways of <unk> and we find new ways to be <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum was born again in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academics and public and general they were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao increased in a half a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first one star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> and wild ways, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
And the same thing did the leading mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new <unk> country has another star architects.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, would have been walking up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation <unk> can take a ship, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology -- you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers -- and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we know if he designed four years ago was successful or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to be <unk> because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media that we have, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it will be in both extreme extremes almost in <unk> and they actually become the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked at exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it turned into a media, because these are not just the images of a building, because these are not just the images of a building, because these are not just the images of a building, because these are not just
And as you use it to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians <unk>
If that building built today, first of the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there's no answer to what a library might be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and a complicated, and one is no longer a public <unk> which doesn't really have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it through architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go forward and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick in the ideas of what has to be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to make.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage parking garage in Miami and Florida, it can also serve to make sports or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means three architects can dream swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars from the community attached around that cause, is no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we do.
We architects already know how to make more intelligent buildings and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to you.
Finally, we are no longer <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they give them a way to the <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the step of the room to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
They <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And I got to think about doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, he just wants to be loved and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Between what his mom says and what his friends or fellow school -- they say, don't know who believe.
So a video of her, he puts it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager that gets these answers into one of the stages of their more emotionally.
Thousands of people are published in videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They are under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that is <unk>
This environment, of being connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of people who have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is true or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is brought together.
What is the most important thing about the life of someone in front of somebody in front of a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news from girls now.
<unk> size is zero to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes superheroes and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other ways they start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how we <unk> society and the developing field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One of every five you're not attending at all the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the exams, if you don't think you see it good, specifically if you don't believe you're happy enough -- you get a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about what they look like.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it gets regardless of what these young people do.
So to be clear to me, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really at.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenage girls are doing less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, engage in more diet and not healthy that they can take them to a food mess of food.
They have low self-worth.
They are easier for the people surrounding them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this by what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and the drug of alcohol and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetic relationships to early and no protection and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see it.
Think for a moment when this is doing our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be that <unk>
So we will have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
Isn't it enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first one is that we have to instill in trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these aren't working.
And I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only going to have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be critical points for anyone to provide a education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the business, and we're a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution from our politicians on <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete to the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge the people so they are, not as you see.
We all can start by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can encourage people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together like communities, as governments and companies to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to grow their own person, valuing the individuality, diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
So by making a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that come out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they believe that you can never see the <unk> of being who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who have your mind?
They <unk>
They <unk>
They <unk>
She <unk> his <unk>
It might just be the woman who is at two car seats. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, which was going to be <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would give their potential to their potential.
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> everyone.
But let's give our children the truth.
So what you see is that the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and for what they do, and as they make us feel.
We would give the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> of a year of age today, will become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The fifth of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the Rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
In <unk> they initially declared to be innocent -- but being stuck by other charges in the company, and they started planning on attacks on the <unk> of New York, including <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Luckily those plans went through an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, he couldn't afford to.
He later <unk> it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer with a loving <unk> American teacher, teacher teacher teacher to be able to give me a happy childhood to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want the same things in life.
And yet, in all religion, in all of human group, there's always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that they think that we have to use all the possible means so that everybody lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekend. He explained to me and some friends had been going to train him in Long Island to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing that our group was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that <unk> gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise us, especially me, all of the goal was on flames.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a child.
All of all, the comment took them a lot of laughter. But only a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted by putting a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the North tower in the North tower of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I already had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class I was often a <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white class, but to be the new of the kind of silent class, and <unk> was sufficient <unk>
So most of the time happened at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to say, <unk> for <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
And I would describe it opera, judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test of my thinking was during presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been victim to <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt too much passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, towards the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish people.
It took several days to go out of light, and I realized there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to overcome the barrier that my whole life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a park.
I found people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
By a chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, on a show, and I could see that several of them were the shortest and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a kid, a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for suffering from others, but it was not easy for me to treat people -- exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be a homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
All evening, Jon Stewart made me honest about my <unk> and helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep it all that hatred inside of it.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and wear a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, one day, which is to try to bring up violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way. That even though I was giving me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak, against those acts, without rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent for any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
At this moment there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's a <unk> movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
He feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as the moments of your childhood you project in front of your eyes.
And it has a <unk> voice, in your conscious thought.
The movie of the movie is you who experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of existence of being human.
Every one of us is a conscious one.
We all have a internal movie and your own, you and you.
There's nothing to do it more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I'm not sure you are aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective actually.
<unk> by nature, is subjective things.
Then there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience was studying the brain <unk> but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations among some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I've presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to a few questions that we want to explain consciousness. So the questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Without <unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the true core mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> as life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of the emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how do they work <unk> how they're <unk> and <unk> the living organisms -- all questions about how objective works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we do -- how we do -- how we do that, how we play <unk> how we play <unk> are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> of heart.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that would work. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness at pure terms of physical terms, that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons.
I think we are going to be on this point.
We have a wonderful string of wonderful problems, great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to <unk> our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there's no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions to explain the brain behaviors -- the behaviors of the brain. And so you study everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness will be heard.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the core <unk> space and time and mass.
You know, fundamental laws that <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not telling in terms of the most basic terms.
Rather, they think of fundamental people, and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space -- mass, laws of Newton. So it <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas in space -- and time, mass, then by the question of logic, you have the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science, right?
It opens up the way to make scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other central concepts in the space -- the mass, the mass, physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could use them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, flies, flies, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think about <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This might sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worthwhile to notice that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind looks more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we would think about thinking about the physical process, is it <unk> consciousness with information.
So whenever there's information processing there is consciousness.
<unk> <unk> complex, as in a human being, consciousness complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple.
Something really exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> a neuroscientist, I took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> <unk>
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which calls <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I'm supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a massive degree of information integration of information, pretty much meaningful -- quite important.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration is, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a whole bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the bottom.
As it explains Stephen Hawking's Hawking's "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision -- the equations of physics can be leaving as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical implications.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I was not supposed to eat anything that had consciousness, then it should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if you are conscious.
If this is right, you know, they are really serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for your collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has your own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group as the audience in a TED Talk right now, we have a collective collective consciousness -- a internal film for this whole group of TED -- different from the internal movies of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical perspective, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer of the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If you don't, well, probably this is the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to figure that out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile a under education.
I went to school, I went to school with my friends, and I was scared with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take care for a community award for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem evident.
She's not achieved anything.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class of 11 studies, a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things in school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability and inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to be.
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to do it? Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to the disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A cap <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not something wrong and you can't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of these.
You may have seen one, from the little girl with a pencil with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because it would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you are that person?
I've lost the count of the number of times that have been approached with strange <unk> to express that they believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will encourage people with disability to benefit from people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
So we got some things.
But the things we overcome aren't the things you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's actually just just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here with inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> other people with disability at all time.
And yet, I don't know that I'm smarter than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to collect the things that get me over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery of the mobile phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that it's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs, has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.     <unk> at a television screen will not make the <unk> for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered no <unk> to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we would be <unk> by getting out of bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the authentic achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at the age of 11, in a high school in Melbourne is not a bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability does not make us <unk> but question what you think to know about it is that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and professional football <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please don't get up.
When people think actually <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to <unk>
The first step, it's what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would love with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what it's running through the field of game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of us, and we were trying to <unk> it with everything to be.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I would have some videos to show you what the Google is using the Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the football field from <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we have people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into <unk> how do we bring it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many people know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, dear.
No, no, no, no, no. I want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian roller <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball into the bottom of the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of her <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when <unk> <unk> and owners look at the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to his field <unk> so they would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I put the <unk> put on <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster.
In <unk> imagine you're a player going back to your group and you see your next big way that you see in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they're going on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just come out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate losing games.
If you lose matches you <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategies <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game in real time.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You also get information from the sensors on <unk> and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is being sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have <unk> information.
This is going to make the good equipment.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for communication.
It would be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they are the field.
He would have the ball and <unk>
You get to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't get it, but the system of <unk> will <unk>
It was going to be on the protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there's an open receiver there.
You get the <unk> but you get to you.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in its bombsight a patch of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I will do lots of people to see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, be in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad it is their actions from <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay technology in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it also worth a <unk> or a Neil <unk> Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, just as the always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I spent the <unk> in the southern County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a chief chief engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much at <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is no practical or <unk>
But from their openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, that each of you from him frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which will <unk> vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that not, they normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that those of us who are doing this method of suicide is going to realize the death of death to the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are to take care of life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its most dark, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked to a officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with glad that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
And so we need to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officers, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason Jason <unk>
I met him 22 percent Julius last year when you get a call from a possible suicide guy sitting on the <unk>
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to the New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown down to two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking with <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, it could tell me, and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he was gone.
This sort of kind of smart guy in New Jersey had just gotten life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the next day, the family of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been asking it.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I make these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved to be <unk>
What do you do?
Let's figure out what to say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk about, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel, because you probably don't get it.
It's just being there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end his life, you've had these <unk>
It will lead to the person in front of them can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read them.
"Hello, <unk> I think you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends that tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but by noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the age of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police police <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house, and they reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much to fight for those who can be <unk> too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, on a radio call by a possible person who could a suicide guy on the sidewalk <unk> near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north
I was able to get my wall on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> foot on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed immediately <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his own day to come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out to get it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that he did, and he gave the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
They stopped speaking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter of a mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious, of all of those traits <unk> but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as it says.
We give God by yourself.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited San Francisco at San Francisco at the night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Currently, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
He talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, I promise to myself an opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who considered suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Typically, this is achieved only by three things: sleep, drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded to, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and called suicide <unk> around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
So for that time, I got my hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people who we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second ones who stopped the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be used to do.
<unk> you can prevent.
There are help. There are hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you're not, but you know what you are, and a question you know, and a question you're going to ask you, how do you focus on that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way, I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since I had since I had since I had since I had since I had ever been able to get the dream of the child.
My outside of the outside I was finally going to have my inner truth, with my inner self.
So for reasons that I will be going to go to me later, when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, you know, I got it <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning to go.
We all have our families, our families, our society, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value value to get rid of the constraints imposed by the color of the skin or by beliefs of those around us.
They're people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my <unk> agent, my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that it's really more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I will never tell you to share my story, not because I think that being what I'm bad, but why the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture celebrating the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still 15, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a spelling of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and on the 12th night, and that night, he won in the bathroom, won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> among more than 40 targets.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was within the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from <unk> women's <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that it passed my app from the green card that I could go to live to the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and he said, "You know that if you <unk> the United States -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I went to Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the rural cities of Thailand to do the most sophisticated surgeries and safe.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary before the name of the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's driver's license, and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears was <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> she lived his truth, but that, <unk> made his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we make a global waking percent of the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood up with injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and only for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that some day there is no longer more <unk> from <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
They'll do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Absolutely. Sure. First of all, thank you all my <unk>
To my network of support, to my parents especially, to my family, which itself is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women <unk> that I have <unk> and a few times, when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I took the phone, he would take my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just an identity of gender, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned to birth to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table on the subject that sometimes that task didn't block, and there should be a space that would allow people to do, and this is a conversation we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In many societies, <unk> and tribal societies are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who met her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts were <unk> in 2011, the National Prize <unk> in the peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, from violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when you were born a girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome to his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives your <unk> to mother and no one of the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, a sad one.
When he gives light to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just stem mother, but the daughter. The daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admits of his brothers.
Up to 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when they go into adolescence, when it comes into 13 years old, you get to get out of her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family, and if I had the code of that honor, honor, and even kill.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of their sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
<unk> is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl has to be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and to embrace their father's decisions and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the very young <unk> has to follow it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same question of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so long before he <unk> thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, I <unk> him in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies in tribal societies, is a big event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One <unk> that has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they were <unk> the form of symbolic <unk> and I was on the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written on no document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school and girls in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and let the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers to be killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the 10 years, I got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, he was offered her same for the New York Times, and I spoke in every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine in October 2012, was hit by <unk> in his head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would give him to my wife and "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't get you."
<unk> the fair cause.
It will be your life in play by the cause of truth, because of the peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get sick.
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These very few words I spend a lot to me, and I didn't get to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm well with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please don't get up.
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when they didn't have his task.
They fight with their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about a special <unk> that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
So I didn't do what I did.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm a engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Google visualization -- but all the work I'm going to talk about here about the science of the brain, I made it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you a <unk>
You are still like smart or not?
It doesn't be like this, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, more than a dozen different chemical powerful one day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> it to live with life.
More than I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have <unk> soul for what I decided that I would try to get out to try to get the doses of <unk> because there is really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to test different, and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose -- dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case, for a few months, I tried dose and a typical chemical dose for an elder man, and I was amazed by looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --   -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem with the front, and it just doesn't happen that way.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, since I got better with men.
What I was trying to do is where we adjust those hormones and <unk> and so on, was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
And so I think of almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point how to do those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great <unk> mental <unk> really <unk> well sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a film director would be able to use his imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty in order to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get this with two recent experiments done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, an fMRI MRI -- to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain from a person who looks at a picture.
The United column of the brain shows the scan of the brain from that same individual as you were looking at that same picture.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the upper column on the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This was repeated in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields, <unk>
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos, while their brains were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of reactions in the brain to the video sequence.
And then I showed you a new film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain brain information to show you what it looks like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're well near it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you can imagine that same image, you think in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the natural scanning systems of natural resolution and their resolution to increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are so many techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and you can introduce your own.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection by images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask us the next, this technology will be the end of the way to be the <unk>
The conventional wisdom is that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, don't increase by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of magnets larger, let's make better magnets away.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a large amount of effort in MRI was to make large, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and bright solutions and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field -- you have a magnetic field -- <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> to the radio radio.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing patterns -- we can dramatically increase the information you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our rising knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I've mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is the dream.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have few choices to open up this door.
Anyway, you choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine taking a lot more.
We have to learn how to make this step together.
Thank you.
Let me talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet all.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet might be telling some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who's pregnant, or to tell someone who has cancer, or any other new conversation that you have done in life.
I all have a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and had come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of the South Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope in the <unk> of my pants <unk> and because I had my head -- I was going to ask me a little kid, and I asked you usually a child -- "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And I would see a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it will go through it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that next time would say something.
It should be that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time was prepared to be in the verge of the female issues on the table.   He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep round of deep and I went down and my back a four-year-old girl with a dress and pink looking at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a little girl or <unk>
So I took a long way back to again, again, I got a little bit about her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing, I know this.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and he saw a child, but I'm a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a dress <unk> and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I am a little bit more about the kind of girl.
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> by <unk>
And that was all about it, "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> they <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from you or you or your yours.
I would give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet was harder to come out of their own, but this is the <unk> It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared banking banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder to tell your child five years you're going to <unk>
There is no more difficult, there's only the hard.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do with the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make it security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine himself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight for any four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> <unk> and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my whole strange strangers I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was going around purpose.
It was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill.
One of my most memorable boat launches was on my sister.
It was the first time a lot of the guests knew it was gay, and when I do my wife of lady in honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who had been known to me.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women initially would join Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing their support, to make me know that I was on the side of my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing her husband <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're true with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you would be.
That's how hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through a gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others have to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Sean <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they are gay, they <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can come out wounded safe, <unk> by what they've done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some people will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you can find yourself in a dark closet, you know, a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would have a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
Let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth and Earth and Earth and the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept of the intelligence of the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that explained how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through several disciplines, that I think, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be very accurately adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in a robotic movement, there's been a whole variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent to an E = <unk> for the intelligence I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is an F, force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open options, with a <unk> force, with the diversity of potential future accessible, but to an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open choices.
And so having in account of this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> it is?
We have the level of human <unk>
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology they have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection, <unk> between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually starts directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long-term entropy in any system that can be found inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games of human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without it to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have apps for humanoid robotic robotics and human assistance technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from the opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here is successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network right together.
This same network capacity also has apps in health care and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, and discovering success and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated simulated series of <unk> <unk> by successfully increasing the assets under their management level.
This ability management management will have vast applications in finance in finance, safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of cognitive human behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all of a single equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom to action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> The <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you were <unk> intelligent, would have a <unk> rebellion in the beginning of it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion in the reverse way.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all future possible is a fundamental principle of the most fundamental principle that the general intelligence can actually arise directly to take control instead of being backwards.
Another significant consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, "How are you looking for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence is this: The intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've widened a lot of our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points around the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the dim <unk> intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light to us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance there are between them and their mother.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the hottest hot <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for millennia now are actually disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused at a global scale have passed away our ability to alter their course.
But I am not the weather scientist -- no <unk>
And I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more you look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the only planet discovered and the planets that we know best about our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the Sun, it can be considered to be a potentially livable world show that by a mission like that.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, partly that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Local companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty awful place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth air, air is cool and filled with oxygen forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will be able to get a big and sad <unk> the implication, the implication, and the belief of some of the Mars waiting for us to save there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is that it's really livable Earth.
For a lot that I like exploration -- I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to give us to humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the captain of truth will be later in the life boats    Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of the land, maybe we could satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi said, having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only terrestrial <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary links and the <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to recreate the emerging environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would take my own home.
And while I was on the front porch. I looked at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly he tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they all were closed away.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to it and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was able to get my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive but sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, I was right away.
I'm a <unk> a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> who increase your heart rate -- <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, you know, the probability of it is a total resource.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> Prize <unk> Prize and a little embarrassed told me that I broke the window, and, I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what was going wrong, right?
In <unk> as it says, <unk> you look forward and try and figure out all the things that might go wrong, then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious things.
At the house, you get a place for the things that you lose very easily.
This sounds common in common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make the location of the important things -- where the fish are fine, where the fish are, that the fish are <unk> the <unk> trees in the living trees and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, the very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys in the car, <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home you would put a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
So for your passport, a particular drawer.
So for your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it, your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture with a picture of your credit card card license, the <unk> passport, <unk> themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases your <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
