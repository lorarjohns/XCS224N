You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can see myself as a farmer, or leather clothes, and no one has chosen an agriculture.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and operators.
And you know, a spark is usually something that fell you somewhere in place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as an operation.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bolton.
It's the kind of complicated cycle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle of the average school, in Stanford, Ohio.
And they beat up every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to enter the bathroom of the teachers' room.
I did it in secrecy.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California, I found a love -- and in the 1980's, I felt the need to start working on organizations that were struggling with AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I received a phone call from that masterpiece, the poet that he said, "I need to see you.
I'm disillusioned that we would never meet.
You could come to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever encountered.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to join you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland, at Cleveland.
We went to see, we laughed, we cry, and we realized that she needed to be hostile.
We found a place, and we got it into it, and we took care of his family because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to meet me as an adult came to meet me, it became a chain box, and it was standing in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed up, and he had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was presented in itself.
The opportunity is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It really needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this today.
You also need dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature, and it's all interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first shoes.
I was amazed.
My heart carrier, I was started, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The tons around me would drop out of the water almost 60 meters, and I couldn't even think that it was a snow of snow over another seventh year after year.
The tapestries are born when they get rid of the glaciers or break the ice booms.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and they hold up until the end, whereas others can't afford them more and they fall into a dramatic passion correlation.
It's easy to think, by looking at a top, that are isolated and alone, largely as we see sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a punch melts, I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a rooftop releases rich water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I approach to photograph these tons as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that at these unique moments exist in that way, and they won't exist in that way.
It's not death when they melt. It's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the tapestries that I photograph is very young -- it's a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a shop that photographed in Kenkatistan, Greenland.
It's a little bit often to get a rolling container.
Here you go.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg.
You can see here, it starts rolling down, the ship has moved towards the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a Union shell, average size.
Apart from water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is real time.
And so the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one of them is understanding a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about consciousness itself, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome of the egg.
And, in the other case, the X-ray chromosome is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
They both press and start life.
We'll go back to them later.
In my activity I tend to fulfill two roles.
In one of my role, I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm an historian, and what I study in this case is the way people tackle the anatomy -- that is human and animal bodies, how they have regarded the body fluids -- the idea of the body -- what they've thought about the body.
The other role that I play in my work is the activist, as a patient phone, or as I say sometimes infected from people who are medical patients.
In this case, I worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working with twin twins, two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with environmental people, and people are much lower.
And I've worked with many cases of people with alternate sex, individuals whose physical type doesn't fit into male and conventional schemats and conventional femininess.
In general lines, we can call it interpretation.
The interpretation takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't escalate in male or female form.
For example, there's the case of the individual with computer computer whose GPS gene from the chromosome and says to the protections, that we all have in the fetal life, who become terrorists.
And then, in the fetal life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual turns out of testosterone.
It's the insulin supply to the angers.
So, there are high testosterone levels.
As a consequence, the body is developed following a typically feminine process.
When birth, the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the sensors, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when somebody realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having operators and tears, they actually have testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's about a man, but it doesn't really look like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called supernormal glands.
They're in the back part of the body.
Super-shaped glands produce angers, the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a typical woman, don't know their chemotherapy structure, I believe being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the angers.
We produce angers and respond to the angers.
As a consequence, somebody like me has the brain more exposed to the angers than the woman who was born with testicles that has the insulin supply to the angers.
So sex is complicated -- it's not that the interconnected are in the middle of the spectrum -- in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: A few years ago, I received a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as the variant -- I had a girlfriend, and sex relationships with her, carried a life as a boy and just discovered that I had operators and the thing.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as a superior hypering hyperbolic hyperbole.
I had 20th-century chromosomes, and in the turn of supernormal glands, they were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were misunderstood, their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
I was born with a child -- nobody suspicious anything.
And it was at age 19, when he started to have medical problems, caused by the internal message, when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside it.
Well, another quick example of a case of interdependence.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what they are known as opportunities, which is, they have an online tissue wrapped in the testicular tissue.
We don't know good why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies -- whether they are honest, or simple twins, or internal twins, they are subjected to normal surgeries is not to be able to get a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get a number of surgery is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have female identity, of course, to be black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when we presented a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with catastrophic.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture vis-a-vis in our culture.
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic individualism.
Imagine how amazing it is to have kids who are born like two people inside the same body.
The highest case is last year with South African corridor, Carol Sembion, put her sex in the International Integratives of Berlin in Berlin.
Many reporters called to ask me, "What are you going to do to determine if Carolina is a man or a woman?"
And I had to explain to reporters that there is no such thing."
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't take an awful line between men and women and untold men and women and women and internal and internal women, and we are ourselves who we take that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science gets, the more we have to admit that these categories -- and we thought were stable anatomic categories that correspond directly with stable ideological categories -- are much more likely than we thought.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology allowed.
As we see, we get into a strange terrain.
Here, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we going to do to do with them in just a few nucleis?
And as we make progress in science we get more and deeper in an uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we manufacture are probably too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in every aspect of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to take a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the photos.
There are a lot of discussion today -- maybe not in public, but it is inside medicine -- about when somebody else is dead.
Our ancestors never had to see them with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of them put a pen in front of the nose, and if they were not moving yet.
If I stopped moving out of it.
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to face the dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us into a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could make someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, I define people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
To let these categories are much more unstable.
Think about the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a proxy of the Founding parents.
I know they were racist, I know they were sex, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each other by watching that music for 1776, and not by the music, which is totally passive.
That's what happened in 1776 with the Founding parents.
The founding fathers were, for me, the first activist activists and explains why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one who was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And, as they all remember, what our parents rejected was the idea of the monarchy. The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth rights.
They had the blue blood concept.
They were from the idea that the political power was reached by the right blood rights to father and then to the son, etc.
The founders rejected that idea and replaced it by a new anatomic concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They leveled the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the anatomic differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of an illustration system where they were getting two things.
He was managing democracy and at the same time the science was born.
And it's very clear -- if you look at the history of the Founding parents, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were getting rid of the supernatural explanations and so they rejected the concept of supernatural power transmitted by a spiral idea of birth rights.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence -- talk about nature and the God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And we were essentially transmitted by the idea of anatomic coincidence.
And by doing that, they were sitting the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think it was that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women succeed.
Then he came up with the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from Southern Turkey Calteries, who said, "I'm not a woman?"
We found men in the lanes of the Civil Rights Movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who was pushing the anatomic awareness over the anatomic difference and, again, they succeeded.
We see the same thing with Disability movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the coincidence we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain gods.
But, attention, I want to keep some anatomic divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean we should give us to the anatomy.
I don't mean that the five year-old kids were supposed to have sex relationships or married.
There are some anatomic divisions that for me make sense, and I believe we should keep going.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings carved at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both concentrated in the middle of 1979, exactly the same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry in the contract, born in term, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary is attributed all three months before Henry -- the right to the sex consent, the right to the vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other rates in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- though I haven't told you if it's X, in virtue of being considered a man now is possible for mandatory environmentalism that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary on his hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So there are still anatomic categories that are in a number of aspects are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advanced so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be developed?
I don't want to give up to science, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like science is explicitly.
Where do we go?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude, "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it."
But a lot of people have been stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided to marry a man with a man not to have chromosomes, and that to marry a woman, you have to have a chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't do clinical exams.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the insulin supply to the angers.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speeches "I have drawn a solution.
He says we should judge people based on the color of their skin, but in the content of their character," going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very nice."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of your character?
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be based on this to make people rights to people, because I will admit that I know about some of the ones that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some speakers that I know can make more informed decisions, smart and maturitors about their sex relationships than people from 40 that I know.
So, how do you put the issue of the content of character?
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured with an instrument, maybe with a magnetic MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
So what I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to guide this stream of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iran where a man who feels attracted by other men is sustainable to be killed, unless it's willing to commit to a change of sex, in which case they are allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon with which I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twin twins to get them apart and then to get their fame in.
But when the phone was asked by the phone, it was a very risky operation, I replied that in that other country these kids would be very abused.
And I said, "Well, you've considered the political asylum rather than the surface separation?
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be those who are without forcing them to change for the welfare of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, in closing, I mean I've been talking a lot about the parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as I could have been, if we had given greater involvement to the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist feminist -- and that is, I think there can be different ideas from different anatomic techniques, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years ago, since I've been interested in interpretation, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that have been interested with is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about the cross-cultural studies is that women, on average, not all, but in average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to engage those who are vulnerable inside the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
Years ago, when I was in grad school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself feminist -- I was making a strange plant.
"Tell me what the feminism is feminine."
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with defeating gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in the feminist."
But the more I've thought about his question, the more it seems to me that there is something female in the feminism.
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attentive to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable ones.
So, if the parents were very reluctant to find a way to protect people from the state, they may have injected more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the recovery support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond the anatomy: thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect note, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks where it wants to go to live and work and have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of millions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to get them.
But the striking thing about cities is that they are going more than their cost of build.
So we could easily deliver the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just unpack them by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already proportions, and in the other hand, it would still be missing.
You could try to increase the capacity by making applications in all the buildings there.
But you know that the problem that you're facing is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the nuisance and the distribution of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those applications.
But they could go to a totally new place, build a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place facilitate building rather than putting them out.
So I proposed that governments create new amounts of reform enough to keep cities and gave them a name: cities under status.
More or less at the same time, Javava and October were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75 clothes would come out of their country to go to the U.S., and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, Honduras.
In the next regular elections, Pete Lobal impulsed with a platform where I promise reforms and at the same time.
He asked October to be his boss, gay.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk on TEDGlobal.
Through a process of perfection, trial and error, and a lot of trials with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under the status of its most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those norms that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both technology and the norms that are usually the norms that prevent us to move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to Javava.
They called me.
They said, "Let's put this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than its monetary cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, October said, Paul, maybe we could see the video of the TED Talk."
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under a statue is a place where you start with concerned land, a status that specifies the rules that are going to apply there and an option for people to choose if they want to go and live under those norms.
So the House president called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go to Technorator and talk about nine and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denerket and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denebley.
Only this airplane covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the controllers that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone applaud corresponds.
The faces of the audience were very serious and attention.
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor Romo, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this on my computer.
So I sat down and show the TEDTalk.
And this explains the essentials -- that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could get to be in Honduras. Instead of hundreds of miles away north.
And it also includes new choices for leaders.
Because the Honey Administration leaders would need help from an associated countries -- they could benefit from the countries that helped them to establish and make the rules of the status so that they could all trust that the statue is effectively collapsing.
We went and watched a site.
This picture is from there.
I could easily get a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, on January 19, they voted in Congress to understand their constitution and add a constitutional device that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that just happened through this painful crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional complaint was 124 to one.
All the parties, all the factors in society, was shocked.
To wrap together in the Constitution, you have to pass twice twice.
On February 17th, he was approached again in another voting, 111 to one.
Rwanda immediately after voting -- 21 to 24, a delegation of about 30 drivers were in the world that are more interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new great center of the city that's being built in South Korea. It's bigger than the Boston Center.
All you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the permission.
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to come, and at the same time it would allow to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow your Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new court system.
There are urban planners and buildings that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that would like to install in America, especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to move immediately to another place.
There are one million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job, sometimes they are flying mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children who are trying to meet their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So, what does it seem to think about building a new city in Hondurielle?
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new leaders?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my turned friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm Jesus, and this is my valley.
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public configuration, and that is, I live with the suits of the suit.
I love to find, dress, and more recently to photograph and post on my blog blow tight, colored and different for each other.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is secreting from seat markets and stores of second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores, let me reduce the impact of my supply in the environment and my wallet.
I come to meet interesting people, usually my money goes to a good cause, and my aspect is unique.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is my star?
Will I like the color?
Will it cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Back to the theme of my valley, I want to tell you what I packaged for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up with somebody who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
Interesting clothes for a week is all I put in my valley.
I figured it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after getting here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks through TED in inner underwear,  that means that I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting.
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is brilliant tiger free.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You can almost see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole thing, including the jacket, was 55, and it's the expensive thing I've used in the week.
Long: color is energy.
It's almost biologically impossible to be heavy, when you're looking at a bright red dish.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: The integration is shading.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you surround your right people, you're not just going to understand, you will also appreciate you.
Mirorious: Guinea of the child you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that I play the disasters, or I remind them to their little seven years.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
JF: Trust is the key.
If you think you're looking at something, it's almost sure you're not.
And if you think you're not looking at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look you can't attract yourself.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Virgin: A universal truth six words for you: the golden lentils come with everything.
And finally, Saturd: Development is a wonderful way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it over and over again when people came up with this week was just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversation.
Obviously this is not going to get into my little valley.
So before I go home, Brownel, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to get emotionally excited to these things, because on the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful, brilliant suit, if there's a little love in my heart and search for me.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if we used a scale to measure the request of every hemisphere, we could design a blueprint of our brains.
For example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So, where do you locate your brain on this scale?
Some of them would choose for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the integrate of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great deal in both hemispheres at the same time.
Not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logic and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that just like most other experimental quantum physicists, we need a lot of logical to connect these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We put together with them and then we see how they react. And then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same.
Certain intuition that you may have developed with the past of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, they developed.
I remember observing a child playing on a parking bar.
He was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always fell down.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the transparency, to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you are a particle physics physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these strange particles.
And when they play their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really bizarre -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it is because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a particles.
But it didn't fit well to my logic either.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a quantum mechanical mechanism.
So what we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can see the green point right in the middle.
That's the metal request that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to take it a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a fine approach to the small metal traffic.
So what we see is a little bit of metal, with a form of transplant and that supports supported on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this orbit with a form of swimming piles that are under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superpower, but for it it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people climb up to do those things, because I don't want them to piss them up, or actually, I'm going to suck up.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travel of the invasive objects are not just people, it's also the light that shines it and the wind that's going on on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to exploit all other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We took the lights out, then we introduced a vacuum and we extract all the air and then we cool it at a temperature of less than one degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just on the elevator -- the little piece of metal is free to act as you want.
Then we measure their motions.
We discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was like an breathing like this shape -- as a function that spreads and contrast.
And when we give it a smooth push, we could make it vibrate.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean to be rattling and not vibrating at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are quiet, and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in details when those are lined up.
In the rest of the time they're declared.
He wants to say that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what at the same time means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
And it was worth getting locked into a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that metal metal is more or less the same than the difference between that metal metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you guys too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if they were in many places at the same time, what would that be?
How would you act your consciousness if your body was declared in space?
There is another part of history.
And it's when we heat it up, and we switched into the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just done in a small space.
You hear a lot about quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are. And that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Ami.
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
Many business and stories, I assure you, with 170 very interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There are a lot of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story is explained just in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I grant from a great education -- not -- but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and going to museums. I started to learn a lot.
And working in Google, I'm trying to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a huge team of people, and we started to do it.
I better show the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we have led to the launch of its launch.
So, we're just going to Google Google.
Look around all the museums.
There's the gallery Galaxy, the MoMA, the Emily, the Result, the van Gogh.
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to Metropolis, the art Museum of New York.
There are two ways to do it very simple.
We click and painting, we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombay, or Microsoft, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get fun.
Do you want to navigate the museum?
We opened up the plane, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hallway.
Keep forward. Go forward.
Excuse me.
Thank you, but I didn't get to the best.
Now I'm standing in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The Heads of Pieter Bretto in Metropolis.
I see the sign zinc.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the metaphor data.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the pictures that we've captured in what we call the government technology.
So this picture, for example, contains it, I think, about 10 billion pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get?
So let me show you what you really get with 10 billion pots.
It can make around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression.
But if you really wanted to go deep.
So I started playing, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a minute, this looks interesting."
I walked in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I researched a little bit, I talked to some people in the Metropolitan and I actually discovered that this is a game called "Sugar," which is a game with a pole with a pole on the Tuesday.
And it seemed very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to go even deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the picture, so you'll see really what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night started."
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the pancreas?
And if you want to see how Evan Goghrer actually created this professor teacher?
It increases it and really achieve.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "The night "starlight" night I never saw it before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things more here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "companies."
All of you, absolutely all, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a mania, that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we enter -- I created this function that I call the power of the "to" -- we just made a zooming around it.
It's about "The Markers in the National Gallery in London.
You can analyze things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel about contemplating these masterpiece work.
So in conclusion, I think to myself, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium, I hope to do justice to its artwork, and it's pictured in the line.
And the big question that they do today is, "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?
And the answer is no.
It's to fill the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a pilot, a flying pixel.
In our lab, we call it sensible design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm an Italian ear, all the children in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom, but the reason I show you this is that something very interesting in Formula 1 in the last two decades.
It makes some time ago if you wanted a Facebook racing to win a budget and it was a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good, you won the race.
This is what in engineering is called real-time control.
It's essentially a system that has two components -- a sensor and an accomplishment.
Now what's interesting is that real-time systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers to free air.
And, as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected.
The cities are big.
As an aside, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of energy consumption -- and up to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these detectors and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from a prototyping Pacific Anthony exhibition at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called "The "Story" "I'm "profit."
Well, our objects, the environment, start talking to us.
In a way, it's like almost every single atoms become sensors and accessories.
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with outer environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old Angeles dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo Angeles sculpted the Moses, he says that at the end, he took the hammer, and he took it to the Moses -- you could still see a little baby underneath -- and he said, "Did you have paintbrushed?" "Why don't you talk to me?"
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts talking to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, insisting on the idea of capturing the environment and performing something.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our laboratory.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of you remember it, played Italy and France, and at the end, Ziplaus gave the head.
And anyway, at the end of Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day observing activity happening on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Columbia in the middle and the River River.
It's the morning, before the game.
Time line is at the top.
There are people over here, and there are calls moving around.
It starts the party: silence.
Gold from France.
Excuse me. People do a quick call, and goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of the regular time.
First additional time, second.
Ziddle, and at a moment, the head.
Ganda Italy, yes.
That night everyone went to celebrate the center.
There you see the great spike.
The next day everyone went to the middle of the winning team and the first minister of time.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called Circle Massacre where, from the romance period, people will celebrate. It's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection is not people, but things we use and we consume.
Today, we know everything about our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they speak.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags, to track the trash into its shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all they would throw away.
Then we put a little chip on them, a little chip, and then we started to track it.
These are the results.
From Seattle.
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many people in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things, and there's a lot of transparent in it.
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we throw doesn't disappear -- that is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle which is that if the plastic bottle which is that if the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle, which is still there.
That if we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Asab Birdian, could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mention at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Rajasthan.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came up and told us that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology be able to do?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine that you have a cup and valves, voltage valve valves that open and shut down.
It's created as a water cut, with water pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, text.
And when we get closer, the curtain will open so that we can move on, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor Bell.
He liked a lot.
And they have a commission to design the building to the entrance of the Express.
We call it Digital War.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no windows, no windows, but when you approach it so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the salmon, you lower the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter -- when they lowered the roof -- somebody who was there and said, "Did you deconstruct the building."
No, it's not that you have deforested it, but when you go down almost all the architecture disappears.
This is working.
You see the people who are intrigued by what's going on.
And here I am myself trying not to move by testing the sensors that open water open.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
Every child in Zarareh came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opens up in order to let it happen, but a building that kept making cuts and holes of water and one had to jump up not to get wet.
(Audience noises) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, designers, we always think about use that people will give us our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels, the pixels of water, and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopter in the air, and you have a little pixel that changes color like a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before that move with others in sync.
We could form this cloud.
It's a kind of flexible display like this with normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes.
And then all of that could be a 3D inch cloud that you can zoom in, and go through and see from very different angle.
This is the real Florida Florida, going down to form a V, like before.
When the light, it looks like this. Same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an entrance that comes from people from people's movement, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bolly -- one of the best ballet dancers of today, the star of the Metropolitan New York and the Mall Sea to capture their movements in 3D and use them as an input for Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels, the captain in different outcomes.
It's so much 3D digitization as a movement capture.
It can reconstruct all the movement.
You can take all the path.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and motion, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible input for the Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as a cloud of cloud -- like a barn, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody give a little bit for a pixel.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last two decades, we moved from physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge and it's accessible across the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us -- we can move from the digital world, of the self-organizing power of networks, to physical world.
In our case, we might want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today, think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How to move from digital world into the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people engage to do this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our clouds are potatoes.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered from paintbrushers.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from below, to serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of heaven as something you can climb up, like a new summit of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital leap at night, but most importantly is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I would tell you that with just some changes in their genes, they could improve memory for a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be better shape, getting more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe?
How about good living with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What would you like to do?
What would you like to do if you could choose anything?
Audience Member: creativity. Creativity creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
Hands up your hand. Let me see.
First. I probably had a lot of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose your memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about long-lived?
Oh, most of it makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this, the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been an ongoing theme here at TED Conference, but today I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great governor of the 20th century, TED Doha, who was also computerized in the Russian Church, wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of the light of evolution.
But if you effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: Is it just about the past, or the future?
refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this box, well at one end, is of course the most interest in us.
We derived from a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some of them have come back.
We've been here about 130,000 years.
It could seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in its most of the basic machinery of our cells is about the same.
Do we realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same proteins, chemically indistinguishable than the pancreas comes from.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that all of us are in the most bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio Dammid asks them what they do is, they think about bacteria think?
The gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria.
It's clinical, dark, sheet, it's very elected.
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want with no effort on your side.
It's really kind of like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional impedance of some force force towards the date.
But, therefore, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our lifetime.
They help digesting essential nutrients, and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future do?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or distinguished to become something different, something maybe adapted to the environment?
In this vast synaptic symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief compound, the animal kingdom, as a single and unique companies, a small note of grace.
That was ours.
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk so I hope that they've enjoyed it.
When I received college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in clinical organisms, every cell is divided, and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when they appear the multicellular organisms, things start to change.
It enters the sex reproduction.
And very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, one could say that the invisibility of death in the body enters evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student I thought, well, sex, sex, self-confident death seemed to be quite reasonable at that time, but with every year, I had more doubt.
I came to understand George Burrors feelings, who was still acting in Las Vegas well into his 90 years.
And one night someone hit his hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a wonderful lightweight dancer of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, "You see a sex supply."
"Okay, he says, George, "I choose the soup."
I realized, as a physician, who was working on a different goal to the goal of evolution, not necessarily contradiction, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to raise health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next generation -- adapting and surviving, generation after generation.
From an evolutionary standpoint, you and I are like refine rockets designed to send the genetic load to the next rainforest, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we would all understand the feeling that Woody Allen was when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality.
I want to make it not dying."
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity.
Not necessarily favors to the bigger or the stronger or the faster, and even the smarter.
Evolution favors creatures better than their environment.
That's the only survival of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the terrible bacteria that can survive the heat of the smokers that will produce, if there were fish there, fish cooked to the vacuum yet they have managed to make that a cold environment.
So, what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular if we look forward to the next phase -- I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known a lot of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and removed from the population.
And second, as a species, we've built our environment to be adapted to ourselves as well as we adapt to him.
And by the way, we migrated it, and we exclude so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation required for the evolution.
A second possibility is that we produce an evolution of traditional type, natural type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the vessels of evolution will roll down, but they're inexhaustible.
And in the insult of insulation: when as a species of distance planets are going to exist in isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- an attractive and intriguing and scary possibility.
I call it the neuroscientist, the new evolution, which is not just nature, but guided and selected by us as individuals in the decisions that we will make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First we consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what is chosen at the individual and family level.
Think that if it could be possible to be able to choose not only the sex of its discontinualism, but in its own body to do the genetic adjustments to heal or prevent disease.
What if we could do genetic change to eliminate diabetes, or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the apple?
Wouldn't you want to do those changes in your genes.
If you look at the future that kind of shifts, it's going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990.
It costs 2.7 billion dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of human genome at a cost at the age of 20 and a week.
It's not going to be a lot to make the human genome reality for 10,000 and it will be more and more the scope of all.
There are those changes.
Same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect ourselves from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against culture in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good for the tab?
That's reality, and in the future it's going to be more and more possible.
So imagine only two little changes.
Can they change their bodies, but what if they could change the cells of their discontinuality?
What if they could change the sperm and the vulnerable, or changing the ridiculous recovery, and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate the diabetes, eliminate humanity, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more healthy?
And then that same analog technology, that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also embrace superpowers -- a better memory.
Why don't you have the naive of a Ken Jennifer especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson computer?
Why can't we have a faster contribution muscle than allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live longer?
This is going to be irrational.
And when we're in conditions of this to the next generation and we could adopt the attributes that we wanted to have converged the evolution of before in neoporation.
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe it occurred within the next 100 years.
These are elections that your grandchildren, or the grandchildren of your grandchildren, are going to have to them.
Are we going to use these options into a better society, more successful, more considered?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more versatile and more versatile?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions?
For good or worse, and before what I could think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're 90 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine, making a click, click, click.
click, click, click, click. It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting on the DVD.
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assaults.
So immediately, I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds."
The pilot had already looked at the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot line the plane with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
He turned the engines up.
Imagine being in an airplane and no noise.
And then he said three words.
The three most advanced words that I have heard.
He said, "Presenter for impact."
I didn't have to talk about the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was completed.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come up and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to repair, all the experiences that I wanted to have and I never had.
As I thought about that, I came up with a sentence, which is, "Gold wine bad."
Because if the wine is ready, and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to clap anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as we avoided George Washington, who wasn't very much -- I thought about Wow, I really feel a great wing.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give rise to my ego.
And I slow the time that I wasted in things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as I measured in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels wonderful.
I'm not trying to be right. I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock goes down, 15, 14, 13."
You see the water approved.
I'm saying, "Please fly."
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we were leaving, I had the feeling of, Wow, dying is not fear.
It's almost like we've been prepared for it all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go, I love my life.
And that sadness was embedded into a single thought, which is, just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow up.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talented --  And I scream, "gold," like a little bit.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, by connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
Over all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I became a miracle -- not to die that day.
And I became another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenges to imagine that the same thing happens on your airplane -- and please not be that way, but imagine, and how would you change?
What would they do, who are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How would you change your relationships and negative energy?
And most importantly, are the best parents that they do?
Thank you.
I clearly have been blessed in life with many astonishing projects.
But the coldest that I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called TEDxouver.
TEDx was one of the most important graffiti professionals in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running, and he said, "Dad, I feel an ant on the legs."
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, TEDx has a total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony TEDTalk, and its cause.
So I went and reunited with his brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with you?"
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him, and he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that -- I saw Stephen Hawking -- not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices?"
And he said, "No, unless you are somebody important and you have a very good insurance can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anyone see the movie "The Strait and the March?"
They communicate that way -- they go through the toes.
I said, "That's archaeologist. How could it be?"
So I presented myself with just wanting to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a hut that I had no idea how I was going to cover it.
I engaged with his brother and his father there at that moment in that particular moment, "All right, this is the treat: Tony's going to talk to him, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much in their interior can't communicate it."
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called GBC Research Really Lab," who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser score, they draw on that and register negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that appear, they say, are part of a life cycle.
First they start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presence.
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side to a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of insurance, and we got a machine so that TEDx could communicate -- a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And, seriously, it's the most fun thing -- I call it "Mother because when I talk to the guy you get an email email from him, and you say, "I don't deserve it. This guy is great!"
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world -- literally of all the corners on the planet to our house.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and consoriers and consultants took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we did something totally stupid and that when we were going back to the walls of the walls and in place there would be graffiti in place.
But for two weeks, we were playing, we went to the March of Venice, my son was a part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called "Everglades Schrolicance, "The NGO and you can see the description.
These are a couple of cheap sunglasses that we buy, in the Amazon Barder ship, some copper wire and things from Homer.
We took a PC camera, we open it up, we put it on a LED, and now there's a device that is free -- you know, we publish the code -- the freedom -- the software goes down into free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital to say, "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the TEDx room.
I love this picture because this picture is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this business and attacks during the great opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense injuries all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and he's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of parking outside of the hospital.
And he started drawing for the first time in his family and friends -- and he would imagine what was the feeling in the parking room.
The funny thing was we had to break into the parking season, so we felt like we were programming graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email mail, and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was going to draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been underwater, and somebody finally came to rescue me and get out of there so I could breathe."
Isn't it amazing?
In a way, that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us moving, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a Microsoft Pacific.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free. None of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pocket.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong tweeted something about us, and then, in December, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventors in 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up closing the circle, is that in April this year at the Mediterranean geography in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called "Art in the Streets."
And "The Streets are going to have the best exponentials of urban art, Bankstori, Shaker Fairea, CAT -- all of them are going to be there.
TEDx is going to be in the show which is quite impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what's in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the Scarley -- nothing was possible at some point.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with a technology technology technology -- I just recognized something and partnered with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel to do. If not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?"
Thank you guys!
I've spent the last few years getting into situations usually very hard, and at the same time a lot dangerous.
I went to jail.
I worked on a mining mine. dangerous.
film in zones of war, difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in large part of my career, I've been suggesting myself in awful situations with the only purpose of trying to examine social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that they look and accessible for audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the passport I wanted to do something a little differently.
So, some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple weeks ago I took an airplane in Ebola.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights of my TEDTalk.
What was following was, "Up USC NGO shows up: my TED that you have no idea what it is and as content could explode in the face, especially if I put it on ridicule to you or your company in doing it.
But this is a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
Thank you.
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that wild, I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name rights.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we examined the world of marketing.
And as I said before, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be prepared to me, nothing could be analyzed, for something as difficult or as dangerous as stepping into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Spring: I want to make a film that deals with products of products and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is funded with production of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The greatest movie.
What's going on in "The largest film ever sells is that all of the top at the bottom, beginning to end, has images of brand, all the time, from the absurd that appears before the title, the X-ray brand.
Now this brand, Schrolable Standard, the Stanford Center.
These people are going to be associated with film performance forever.
And so the film explores this whole idea. (Music Kassav: It's remote." Is that? (M: It's remarkable."
I'm a round remaining.
It was "President."
But we're not just going to have the package of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure we're going to make sure we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe and become the most cool shoe that you've used ...
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever sells, the best trial you have drink, cortex of "The biggest film ever sells."
Navado Korketon: The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, make them fund the film? (MS: Making them fund the film. MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The whole film goal is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this movie.
That's the full idea, the whole film of beginning to end.
And I would love that CEO to help make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that, it's the ultimate respect for audience.
Good, though, I don't know how recovery is going to be people to that.
MK: You've got a perspective: I don't know if "good is very negative, but you know how is it going to replicate? (MS: How much money does David Cower: How much money do you have to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- DC: Very nice. John Kamen: I think it's going to be hard, the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big brand.
MK: Who knows, maybe for the time that the film comes out, we see it as a lot of allerging idiots.
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart Ruffin: Most answers.
MS: But will it be hard to sell it, by film or me?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. MK: Okay. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands brands.
MS: Yes.
MK: We have some places where to go.
MS: I thought that "shipping the camera meant to have a conversation.
It shapes the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your movie.
MS: And so one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought the concept of advertising, was to present as many people as possible, to make so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario, is not the idea to do with that new vehicle worthy of attention?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a patriarchal mistake, and that mistake was this one.
Actually, there was no such error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what represents this picture.
See, when you're looking for images of transparency in Google --  -- this is one of the first images that pop up.
I like your way to roll Sergey Brian. No.
This was the problem: transparency, free of simulation or deception -- easily detecting or seen, easily unthinkable, which is characterized by invisibility or effectiveness of information, especially in business practice -- being the last line perhaps the greatest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians names, the name of the name -- even the CEOs name it.
But suddenly when it's about making it reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency is afraid --  -- like that weird bear that is still playing.
It's unpredictable --  -- like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is risky?
You eat a whole bowl of Cook White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to tell you a story.
We want to tell you a story, but tell our story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie -- and there he is he used to do -- he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and there's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanted to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirken of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on the middle and go to the companies myself with my whole team.
So what I started to develop is -- what I started to realize -- is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films and huge, giant and others that make small, independent films, like me.
And my friends that make Hollywood movies big, giants, say that the reason their films are so successful because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood films, honests?
And the film is called "The largest film ever sells."
How are we going to see Ban in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out every time I open my boat, you'll see the destroyed Bang.
At any point for an interview with somebody, I can say, "Are you cool for this interview.
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you calm down.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the crash."
And there was one of these fabulous trips.
Both Florida Florida like "Viscuit of Parachute" are going to have its chance.
We're going to have as much for men as a woman, sunlight, ball, like that.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a protected overview.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
It was similar to the kind of smaller films that you told -- we are rather a rival brand.
So we don't have the budget that other marks have.
So doing things like this, you know, remembering the people is the reason why this poses us.
MS: What words would you use to describe Ban?
Bang is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Volunteer: The higher technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the aliena.
Man: We talked about something super-controlled, fragile.
I think "free is a great word that really puts this back category, versus smell and sweat.
It keeps you.
How do we keep failing more time? With better confidence, more often, three times cheaper.
Things like those who respond to benefits.
MS: And that's a multi-consumer company.
What about me? What is a common guy?
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the commons.
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your mark?
Man: Mmm, my marker?
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: reviving the 80s, panties unless it is a laundry day.
MS: Okay, what's the Green brand here?
Green: Something unique. (MS: unique. Man: I guess the kind of gender that I have would be like a dark glamour.
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray and things like that.
And usually I have access like sunglasses, or I like crystals and similarities.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a classic conversation," Mercury, Benjamin.
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it "a cash fly."
Woman 2: In part of a hippie, in the publishing part of it, in part of a Brooklyn Brooklyn, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of matches.
I sell toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my framework.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the market.
Man 5: Fast-forward strategic March.
Is that something?
Angry," I'm a lawyer.
Tom 1: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tamif, but often I'm pleased at the intersection of dark and "catastrophic glass."
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody to get into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the "market Personality."
And I found a company called Olone Zarrier in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Newsweek, February, Hallel to discover that marker personality.
If they could do it for themselves, they surely could do it for me.
Angelving: You brought the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Talk a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world where you live -- like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are organized and start in a place and in my case, and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is, "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings, and your way to be?
MS: It's like, who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about why we do that?
What's the machine? What is the machine?
Why is it important? What does the red.
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, who you are.
What other meditators have happened?
There has to be fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: Ah! (AA: Thank you. No.
A: Thank you for your patience -- (MS: Great work. A: Yes. (MS: Thank you very much. Okay.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy on this.
Linda Zarri: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but complicated, in your brand, Martin Sprawler is a considerable brand.
They are very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to focus on one of their strong strengths or in the other rather than focusing on both.
Many companies tend -- and it's human nature -- to avoid things that are not secure, and avoid the fear, those elements, and you actually have to become something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is classic, Apple.
And you can see here to Target, Window, Minnesota.
Now there are legal marks and conscious markers, those things that have gone and forth, but a length brand is quite powerful.
MS: A lension mark. What's your mark?
If somebody asks you to describe your sense of brand, your branding, what would it be?
Are you an advance attraction? Are you somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you rather an attractive discontinually?
A little warmer, reserved, conservative?
The descendants are like being a doctor like the Prize, contemporary -- adventurers, fearless or bold like Erordy Flinter or professional or golf, or professional, dominant, magical or mystic as Gandhian.
Or are you rather of disconcerting disorder?
Are you conscious, sophisticated like UK?
Are you stable, traditional protesting, protection, protection, you identify with Oprah?
Are you confident, stable, familiar, confident, secure, sacred, controlled or wise, like the Dalai Lama or Yoursela?
In the course of this film, we had 500 companies, the descendants and discontents, who said, "No." They didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control about the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the neuroscientist, and we came to tell the story in this film of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain as much for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Paolo.
In the entire city over the last five years there are no cars, there are no posters, no flying, nothing.
And we went to school districts where businesses are doing road in schools with limitation problems.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer, or the ones that I have more successful is those where I have interacted with things directly.
And that's what these marks did.
They took the interfaces, they took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat the artist directly.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think, that will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you do? Did you succeed?
Well, since the movie sits at the French Festival Forest, let's take a look.
According to Bureau the film sits in January, and since then, and this is not -- and this is not -- we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is only a two-year period.
That's just on the line, no press, no TV.
The movie is not distributed yet.
It's not online. It's not in surgery.
It's not even sitting in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started winning momentum.
And it's not bad because of all the agencies that we talked to them to their clients won't be part of it.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that at those risks are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that, it's pushing them into failure.
I think when you train your employees at the aversion of the risk is preparing all your company to take out of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that can frighten them.
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to give it place to fear.
We have to put that bear into a cage.
We open the fear. We open the risk.
From one hunter at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to get through transparency.
More than ever a little honesty is going to take a long way.
And I said, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk "really "but "Trained Transparency has been presented by my good friends of ECR who, by 1770, bought the rights of the name in eBay.
EM: Becoming big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
ECG presents "Strait the Transparency."
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Morgan, in behalf of transparency, that happened exactly with those 170?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket I have a hut to name from the TED match of TED, the Salaam Foundation, a chicken for 70,000 to be applied to my TED for the next year.
The idea behind the Stutting computer worm is really very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the rise plant in Rajasthan.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we manage these systems that control speed and valves, we can cause a lot of problems with celebration.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we got to put an effective virus of Windows in a portable laptop used by an engineer to confirm this gray box, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind Stuton.
We started with a Winconness facility.
The blind income to the gray box, damages the control, and the nuclear program was embracing, missile mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about Studio six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the Windows part of Windows," the installation used multiple vulnerable vulnerability.
It seemed to do something with these gray, these control systems.
That was called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infected our environment with Stuton and watched what was happening with this.
So they were very strange.
Stephen was behaved as a lab of laboratory that he didn't like our cheese, and it was walking, but he didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized -- and I thought, "This is a direct attack.
It's completely directed."
The installation is actively searching in gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program you're trying to infect is effectively working in that place.
If not, Stephen doesn't do anything.
So that's called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what's the goal.
It could be, let's say for example, an American energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better discover the goal soon.
So we extracted and we compiled the attack code, and we discovered that it was structured, in two digital bombs, a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were perfectly armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much bang the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that Stephenshit sandwich is complex and high technology, let me tell you, load is very complex.
It's very above the top of everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this approach.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks quite like the old unstable language.
I want to tell you how we could make sense of this code.
What we were looking at at first were called functions, because we know what they do.
Then we searched temperatures and data structures, and we tried to relate them to the real world, with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about disorders that we could approve or disappear.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent sail, it must be a valuable white, and it's certainly located in Iran because it's where most infection has been represented.
They are not several thousand targets in that area.
It's essentially reduced to the nuclear power plant of Bush and the rise plant of Natasha.
So I said to my assistant, "Get me a list of all the experts in conflicts and plants of energy between our customers."
I called them and I consulted them in an effort to meet their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital video with the control of the robot.
The roundabout is that mobile part within the confrontation, that black object that you see.
If you drive the speed of this robot, they certainly can break it up and even make the interface explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and discover in an effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers, so that they couldn't solve this fast.
We're trying to decode the digital divine by looking at the data and its structures.
So, for example, the number of 165 spreads in that code, you can't be obvious.
I started investigating scientific literature about how these centers are built in Natasha and found that they are structured in what's called a catcher, and every waterfall contains 166 centrality.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These centers in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the attack?
A almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
For no mallers, it wasn't like this.
The results have been received after several weeks of hard work.
We would routinely end up in street streets, and we had to get back again.
Yet, we discovered that both digital birds were pointing to a single and objective but from different angles.
The small bird is taking a waterfall and making the robots and releasing them, and the big bird communicates with six waterfalls and manipulating valves.
In addition, we're very confident that we've determined what the destroying is.
It's Natasha, and it's just Natasha.
We shouldn't worry.
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There is the gray box, and up to the celebrations.
So what this thing is to intercept the values of the sensors of sensors, for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provides legitimate code, which still runs through the attack, with fake data.
And, believe or not, this failed input data is pre-recorded by Stuton.
It's kind of like the Hollywood film where the robot, the security camera is forgotten video predator.
Is it amazing?
The idea here is obviously not just to guide the operator in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to make a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the vast steam turbine is happening, you have to open up vast valves in a millisecond milligram.
Obviously, this can't do a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're compromised, then they can pass bad things.
The plant can blow up.
And the operations or the security system will notice.
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attacks is generic.
It has nothing to do specifically, specifically, with centralizers, with uranium entropy.
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a car factory.
It's generic.
And you don't have a way to disappear.
You could also use conventional technology of worms to disseminate it.
The most possible.
And if you did that, what you would end up with is a cyber of massive destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with huge numbers of goals.
We have to confront the implications, and we better start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralph, it's been public in many sides that people assume that the Moscow is the foremost behind this.
What's your opinion.
Ralph Langley: OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. Okay.
My guess is that the Mossicis is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is cyber survival.
There is one alone, and that's the United States fortunately lucky.
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for feeling. Thank you, Ralpara.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you supernatural skills, or another one that makes users of wheelchair and go back to walk.
In Berkeley Biocome" we call these robots, explosions.
They are nothing different from something that you put in the morning, give you a big strength, which also increases your speed and help it, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other foreign interests.
This is not an unreal idea.
To show you now what we're working on started by talking about the American soldier who, in average, it has to take on its back a 45 pounds, and it's demanding to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back, 30 percent of soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to take this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you the HCGwender -- or Costa Hungarian Hungaring Harris.
Soldier: With HCRI explosions I can carry 90 pounds through variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in calculations and execute a lot of agency.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then enhances my strength and my resistance.
Elizabeth Bend: We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair users about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people, on wheelchair chairs.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation.
We talk about something that happens with frequently, very young people, with damage.
We also talk about the population that aging it multiplied rapidly.
His only choice, a lot of times -- by a brain injury or some other complications -- is the wheel.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from its successful blessing, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you the ESG who's using Amanda Box 19 years ago he had a injury in the vertical column, and as a result he couldn't walk back to walk for 19 years, so far.
Amazon Both Boyley: Thank you.
EB: Amazon is using our ELAM, which I mentioned.
It's got some sensors.
It's completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board here on the back.
There are some batteries that give power to the engines in the homes, and in the knees, and they do it with this smooth and very nature.
1953, I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing down is paralyzed.
In a fraction of second, I lost all the feeling and all movement from the pearl down.
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Ladie, I'll never walk again.
That was 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last little bit of hope of my self.
The adoption technology ever since, it's allowed me to learn how to slide down in school, climbing rocks and even riding on a hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the wheelchair users of wheelchair to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battery, they practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day, where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Festival Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos of Congo.
Bonobos are together with the chimpanzees, their closest living kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now chimps are known by their aggression.
But, unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis in this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But Bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While chimps are dominated by big guys, terrorists, the Bonobo society is in charge of females, with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not been observed yet.
But, unfortunately, Bonobos are the least understood of the big apes of children.
They live in the depths of the cool jungle, and it's been very hard to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- an extraordinary biodiversity land and beauty, but also the heart of the synagogue itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has been protected for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The meat of meat meat and deforestation do that you can't fill or a stadium with the bonobos that have in the world -- and honestly, we're not even sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hiding the trees.
Who are these prisoners?
We know them as the apes "have the love, not the war, because they have frequent sex, promise and baseball to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems, because the life of the bonobos is more than the Lady Saturn.
Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Playing is not just a child's game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster tolerance.
We learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with generation of diversity, diversity, diversity, diversity of behavior, diversity of conventions.
And when you look at the Bonobo, you see the evolutionary roots of laughter, dance and human ritual.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of the wild medium.
First of all, it's a baby style game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a personality.
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You've got it away from the balls."
Only, I think it loves him, right?
Yes.
So sex play is common as well as in humans.
And this clip is really interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like the testicles -- and also how play requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time is more fun.
But the game is polygam.
The game is polygamory, it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more cold, imaginary, curious, maybe the place where the awe is restricted.
And I want you to see -- this is Fuck, a young female who is playing with wildlife water.
I think, like that, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner and external worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we shape are the real seed of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to more and harder world more and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our adaptation company.
To adapt successfully to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take advantage of our game pattern?
The game is not fantastic.
The game is essential.
For Bonobo and humans, life is not just cruel and defeated.
When it seems like the least appropriate play, they can be the moments when it's the most pressing thing.
So primate parents, we accept this gift of evolution, and we play together as we rediscovered creativity, friendships and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I combine fire as a captain assistant in a body of voluntary furniture.
And in our cities, where volunteers engage a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But still, there was a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain, I was fascinated in a conversation with the landlord that was certainly going through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a parachute, in his pajamas while his house was in fire.
The other volunteers who had just arrived before I was, let's call it Lexe Luther --  he came up with the captain and he asked him to enter and save the dog of the house of home.
Pure: The dog." I was so blue."
There was a lawyer or a management of money that, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people who walked into a building in calls to save a live building just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me an end.
He said, "Beoks, I need to be in the house.
I need to go up, go through fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I just jump it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was -- I put the staircase up, at the end of the hallway, went to the king firefighters that was more or less had finished the fire and entered the room in search for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back on the staircase where I met my Nazis and the beautiful dog on the main door.
We took out of the house the heads for the house of house where, as it was to expect, his treasure.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the drop of house by grateful by the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
And so much in my location in Robin Holiday as in my voice as a volunteer bomber I'm witness with acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but also about acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I learn?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look in this room to people who have done, or they are to achieve it, remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, give it now.
They serve food in a dining dining park park.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have a chance to save somebody's life, but every day, we're going to be able to influence someone's lives.
So go to the game, save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a great fan of the color block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1868 with a very simple idea: cement marrow modules that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They've allowed us to build bigger things than us, like building or bridges, one brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947 to LIGO, he came up with this.
He was called automatic absorb ball.
And in a few years, the LED banks came to every household home.
It's estimated to be more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LEGO made it accessible.
LEGO just adopted the blackout block, the favela in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce -- the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic balls piled by each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
But there's a main difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop Letharetic.
Let me show you how they work.
Lettically literature is electronic modules each of them with specific function.
They're hardwired to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they bind through magnets together.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the roof, blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue with a green green produce light.
We can put a button, and so we have a regular.
If we change the button, by a pulse module. It's here, and now we have an intriguing light.
We added this fire to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, liberals are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and soldiers, Lethare allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures using very simple.
To make more quickly or slower, it just turns this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind Letharistile is that it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to be reduced to bricks ready to use.
Lucks, sounds, solar panels, motors, everything must be accessible.
We've given Lebanese to children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that they don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a night or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We also have Letharitis to design schools.
So, for example, designers with no expertise in electronics begin to play with literature like a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and filter, we have George create.
(Mechanical sounds)  A few weeks ago we took Lebanesements to the Rhode Island School designers who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a chain of confident activated by movement.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a landmark made of plastic that is afraid of darkness.
For these non-visual engineers, Lethare became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material.
So Lebass has open code.
You can visualize the website, download all the design files and fabricate them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and invent.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for us to engage with the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
Hmm. Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in charge.
We can get better and we can continue the video to one side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm already afraid time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything they are supposed to stop -- we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called "Cord for America and would be like a few peace partners for technicians.
We selected some members every year, and we put them to work with menus.
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the so-called municipal world.
They did great apps. They worked with the municipal employees.
Their job is to show the possibilities of current technology.
You know Al Allende.
It's a hydrant of Boston.
Here it appears as if you look at a quote, but what you're really looking for is that somebody is cleaned by the snow because it knows that it's not very good at getting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get help in this single single way?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of "Correct" for America.
They were there in February, and at that time I was born last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these hydrogen.
But one of the members called Erik Michels noticed something else: that citizens wipe up the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an application.
It's a cute app where you can take a hydrogen.
You accept to wipe it up.
By doing that, you put a name, in this case Al Allende.
If you don't do it, somebody can rotate it.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 apps programmed last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government has.
And it goes through viral form.
A responsible system of Honor City to see this app realized that I could use it not for snow, but for citizens to support standards of tsunami.
It's very important to work these terms of tsunami, but people are stealing the batteries themselves.
That's why I asked citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens take off the shell shells.
And Chicago just launch it to make people refuse to clean sidewalks when they snow.
So now we know nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread with no friction and organic and primal.
If you know a little government technology you know that this doesn't normally happen.
Software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by normal canals would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the court power of California, which up until the time has taken 2,000 billion dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that shows you a couple of days and spread in viral form, is a kind of force of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways of working, not like private companies, like many people think it should be.
Nor as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without constraints, in open and profit.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to tackle the government of the government that has the new generation -- not as an unattached institution but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good, because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just "Correct" for America, but there are hundreds of people across the country that contributed to civic apps every day in their own communities.
They've not been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't complain about it.
And these people know something that we've lost of view.
And it is that if we leave the feeling of politics, the line in the DVD -- the dolphin -- and all those other things that get us insane, the government is essentially in words of Tim Research, what we do together because we only can."
Now a lot of people have left the government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask them to rebuild it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change, the government yes.
And because the government in the last instance of us -- remember that of us, the people?" The way to think about it will affect the way we produce change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as many people thought the government was to choose people to make loads of charges.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is essentially really rabbis.
This is the phone delivery of services and information.
It's the place that supports the so-called 16-year-old brand in America.
Scott took this call.
Ingrid Zambia in the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put strong music and see if it walks?"
And it worked. So, Scott.
But that's not the end of the Kigari.
Boston has no center center.
It has an app and a mobile phone called "The Connective Citizens.
We don't program that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the New York Mechanical Mechanical Mechanical Medicine.
One day, this happened, really, is this question: "Jarry's in my trash tube. I don't know if he's dead.
How do I make it back?"
Conflict Citizens Connecticut is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Citizens Connecticut everything's public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, I saw it a neighbors.
The next report, he said, "I approached to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
Zarri? Yes. Yes. Yes.
I turned the cube, I went home.
Good night, "Farrier swing."
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physics.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platforms.
And I don't necessarily mean the technology of platform technology.
I talk about a platform for people to help each other.
So, one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected to two people.
And I could have connected to government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better asset and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
Many people understand it, but think that one is the entrance of the other.
That our entries to the government system is the vote.
How many times have we elected a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfy our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15.
Below there is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word very slowly.
But it is that waste that keeps us through that that belongs to us as something that operates in our contract, that other thing, and we are essentially losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government is happening.
We have to collaborate with the government's machinery.
That's the Oculus movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of citizen citizens who have written a very detailed report of 350 pages in response to the order of the SETI -- the financial reform project in the financial reform.
That's not political activism, it's bureaucratic activity.
And for those of us who have resisted to government, it's time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get where we have to go without solve the institution that can act in behalf of all?
We can't rely on government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is compliant.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act with constraints, only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk about. Everyone's going to speak.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do it.
That's why when the government problem is not important to do their voices.
They're using their hands.
They put hands to the work to program apps that make government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a high-tech, shaking weeds by making a garbage cube that has a rainforest inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those hydrants and many people do it.
But these applications are like digital reminder that we're not only consumers -- not just governments of government we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't fix the city.
So I want to ask all the presents, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, be a vocabulary of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails and prisons and on death row.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these facilities have given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that say here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is truly important.
Here's fantastic presentations.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you're teaching, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, I mean, it's cartoon, it can achieve a lot more.
So I want to talk about power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in practice, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family dominated by a marriage, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She started a lot of the dictionaries in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Varibation about 184.
She was born on 1880 and his experience with slavery confirming the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also loving.
When I was a little and I looked at her, she came up with me and give me a good hug.
I was so lucky that I could barely breathe, and then I was shocked.
One or two hours later, I went back to look, and he came up with me and said, "Brendand, you still feel my husband?"
And if I said no, I was shaking again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that made you want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the top of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
Early on, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and smiled, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room and he took me out of his hand and said, "You see Brenolo. We are going to be converted."
I remember this as if I was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, "Brend, I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to nobody.
I said, "Okay, Mama."
She said, "Now, "Make sure you won't do it." I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and he said, "I want you to know that I've been watching you."
And he said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do whatever you want."
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to give me three things, Brian."
I said, "Surely, Mama."
And he said, "The first thing I want you to promise me is you want your mother."
Addis, "She is my daughter, and you have to promise me to always take care of them."
As I loved my mom, I said, "Yes, Mama, I will."
Then he said, "But the second thing I want you to promise me is you're always going to do the right thing."
I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama.
Then finally he said, "But the third thing I want you to promise is that you will never drink alcohol."
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Mama, I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in the rural south -- I have a brother a little brother and a sister a little sister.
When I was 14 or 15.
We barely make the crazy clicks.
He took a beer server, offered my sister, she took a little and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You go, but I'm not going to take beer."
My brother said, "Come on. And you always do the same thing as we do.
I did something, your sister too. Make a beer.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can go."
Then my brother looked at me slyly.
And he said, "What's wrong with you? Take a beer."
I looked at it with force and continued, "Ah, don't you still think about the conversation with Mama."
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, "Mama tells all the grandchildren that are special.
I was devastated.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread up.
But I am 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a virtue. I say it by the power that the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really make sense of it.
We can't get things to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the proposition.
My aunt died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, as we should be engaged.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1973, there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities, you find so much destination, so much despair, determined by these facts.
One out of three black black ones between 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban communities across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people are in prison or conditioning in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a court system that's much better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not culture, but wealth.
And we seem to be very quiet.
The politics of fear and the force make us believe that these are not problems.
We are disconcerted.
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, they are embarrassed by rights forever if you've got a criminal condition.
Right now in Alabama, 34 percent of the black population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we project it to the next 10 years the loss of rights loss will be as elevated as it was before they passed the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where they witnessed 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, no possibility to go away.
Right now, we're in the process of some literatures.
The only country in the world.
I represent people on the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you've been taught to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the crimes competent?
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There's another way to look at it: it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the consumed crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
Death penalty in America is defined by error.
Out of nine people executed -- it's identified one that is innocent that is removed and liberated from the death row.
A mistake, amazing rate, an innocent in nine percent.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to pilot airplanes if every nine to wake up, one would have to be started.
But somehow we isolate about the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I talk about slavery.
I talked about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by horror.
In many communities, people were afraid of being linked.
They were worried to be bombarded to be bombarded.
The horror threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are bigger people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell people to stop saying that in our history we are dealing with terrorism, after 9/11.
They ask me to say, "No, let's say we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial substance and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about race. I think it's because we're unwilling to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without a truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death death.
It was fascinating, because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's okay to listen to what you say."
Addis, we don't have death row in Germany.
We can naturally never have it here."
The room sat in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and deliberately, we would get to run."
They thought about this.
How would we sit in a world where a nation like Germany, would be executed to people, especially if they were in their Jewish majority?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this decline.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these hard issues, positive things and wonderful things are, however, implemented.
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are unfamiliar by suffering, abuse.
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
We last talk about the need to have more hopeful, greater commitment, more addiction with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the destinations, the ones that will never get to TED.
To think about them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Despite being so rational with the intellectual.
With innovation, the development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas for the heart of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not only the brilliant and unfair, but also the dark and the hard.
Vaccine Harnesh, the great lesbian leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering, we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hopeful, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and being treasures."
Well, that orientation.
There is no disconnect about technology and design, which allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to exclusion, to inequality.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts create a much more challenging identity.
Let's find them back.
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa Parks.
These women are just getting together to speak.
Occasionally, Miss Carry called me, to say, "Brend," comes the Sarah Sarah. We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and listen to us?"
I said, "Yes, lady. Yes I want."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come out?"
I was like, listening."
So I was going and just listening to you.
It was very vigorous, very lighter.
And at one occasion, he was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks ran to me and he said, "Now, Brown, I think that's that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the infusion.
We're trying to help those who have been wrongfully convicted.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sensitivity of life, without parole.
We're trying to do something about death death.
We're trying to reduce the population in incarceration.
We're trying to finish mass incarceration."
I gave it all my best speech, and he looked at me and he said, "Mom Umm Memory."
And he said, "You will end up angry, very far."
At that time, Mrs. Carry leaned up, put my finger on the face and said, "That is why you have to be very valuable."
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to find a way to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been raised in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst we have made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie. It's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong, it's not a stream.
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a murder.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who have to be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is fairness.
And finally, I think that although it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very lighting, we're not going to be overwhelmed by our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual, or rational capability.
By the end, they judge the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich, powerful and privileged ones, but because of the way they treat the poor, doomed them, prisoners.
Because it's this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel defined. I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much strength.
I was tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been sensitive with a lot of driver.
I go to jail and I see my 13 and 14 years old, who have been skilled so that they were just skilled to be just just just as adults.
And I start thinking, how could it be?
How can you judge somebody in which isn't it?
The judge was an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late was wake up -- God -- if the judge can become something that you are, you must have magical powers.
Yeah, Brian, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a movie.
I had a 14 year-old client -- a small, bore, white.
I started working on the mockingbird, with an incision that said, "Mother so that my nine-year-old black warmer is treated as a 75 year-old privileged white white white white.
In the application, I put it up in the application, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a leveraged line on how in this country there is no ethic -- but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that insight would be a dream, or really I write?
For my horror, I had not only recruited it, but she'd sent it to court.
They spent about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally decided -- oh God, I have to go to papercutting for this stupid case.
I got into the car and felt really grandmother, overwhelmed.
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and little permission.
I finally walked from the car. I walked into the judge.
I was going up the stairs when I met a senior black man, was the counter of the judge.
When he looked at me, I came up and said, "Who is you."
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "Is you lawyer?" I said yes.
So I was approaching and embracing me.
And I whispered in my ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was vibrating.
That was deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the audience room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this beautiful monkey?"
I said, "Yes, sir. And we started to argue.
People started to go. They were all ingenuited.
I was the one who had written those crazy madness.
The cops arrived the cops of the fisheries, the auditoriums arrived.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people; we were talking about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye yellowfin to see the consensus that he was going and she was coming.
I looked through the window and climbed all that freeway.
I kept walking around here and for there.
Finally, this old black white, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was a recession.
During the break, an asteroid of the alcohol was shown because the consensus had entered the room.
The assistant was thrown over the old black black.
And he said, "Jamie, what do you do in the audience room.
And the old black man stood up to the assistant, and he looked at me and he said, "I entered this audience room to tell this young man who kept his sight in the goal with the shape."
I came today to TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot be authentically evolved if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is tied to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to forgiveness, compassion and fairness.
And above all, those of the speakers that share this, I just want to tell you that keeping the eye in the goal with firm.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious desire from the audience, in this community, to help in your purpose of doing something.
Something that's not a crash. What can we do?
LS: There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum that is going to make an effort to redirect the funds that are spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, they're going to spend a billion dollars in death row over the next five years.
And despite this, 46 percent of the homicide cases don't rise in arrest.
56 percent of the rapes get nothing.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This referendum is going to propose that these funds are going to be traced to make the law, safety.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There was a huge decline in crime in the U.S., in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is said to do with the highest incarceration rate.
What would you say to those who believe that is?
LS: Actually, the rate of crime has been relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not about violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increases in the prison population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the period chain, by stealing a bicycle, by small crime crimes against property instead of making those resources back into their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brian, you've been thrilled with us today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Peter Davids: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- they would calm them out of the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media media prefer to give us negative news, because our minds are paying them attention.
And that respond to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses get more data than probably the brain can proceed.
And because nothing matters more than surviving, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe.
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
Oldenburg and records all the information searching for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a dozen stories we will prefer to look at the negativity.
That old adage of the press, "If any, "stead" is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising that we are pessimistic.
Surprisingly, people think the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead, instead, what really happens is that we get distances.
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the extinctions of species, the scarcity of water and energy.
As human beings, we're very good at overcoming the problems, and in the long run, we end up with them.
We look at the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life is more than doubled -- average per capita income has tripled all over the world.
Child mortality has been slashed 10 times.
Furthermore, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy that global literacy spent 25 percent to over 80 percent of over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
Many people forget it.
And we continue to make expectations more and taller.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, refrigerators, television, TV, mobile air, and air conditioning.
The marine market markers of the past century, the women on the planet, would never have dreamed with such luxury.
Support a lot of this is technology and lately its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that comes from information technology in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why mobile phones have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and in peace, in terms of depression and in agenda.
It's the result of quick computers used to build faster computers.
Don't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's plotted on a law on the left, it curve up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And in this curve, the Montana Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computing in the cloud, that my friends of Australia called infinite, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuel, vaccines and food, digital medicine, the national and the A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" from IBM?
It was heavy.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that would be.
And I loved this: "Water sells to human opportunities."
Juangic is not an easy game.
I play with the mathematics of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in the mobile.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Singularity University.
We teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can actually affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been absurd.
Today we can point a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create fancy life for every inhabitant of the planet -- it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that thing that is scarce, and turning it up.
You see, the scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Navigol II in the 1980s.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited to dinner the king of Simon.
Napolance troops ate with silver covers, and the same Navarria, with gold gold.
But the king of Simon, he ate with aluminum supplies.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and platinum.
That's why the tip of the memorial to Washington is audio.
You see, although aluminum is 83 percent of the landmass of Earth, it doesn't come as pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and skills.
But then the electronics and the aluminum did something so cheap that we used it as if it was describing.
We project this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet based on 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 electricity stores every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarce, it's about accessibility.
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of sunlight in India is 50 percent less than the decline of defense: 8,000 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the late part of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents a hour compared to the top 15 cents.
And if we have abundance of energy as well.
Let's talk about wars now.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed up the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after the Saturn country?
I took a famous picture. What was it called?
"A pale blue dot.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent per water.
Yeah, 97 percent. It's saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight for 0.5 percent of the water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the nanomaterials.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the crocodile -- I would like to share with you, and he gave me a permit to do it -- his technology called Slipper -- maybe -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to produce 1,000 gallons of drinking water a day from any wave water -- salt water, toxic water, a letter -- at least two cents a gallon.
Coke's president just agreed to do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that's okay, and I have full confidence that I mean, Coke will implement it globally, in 2006 countries on the planet.
This is an innovation for this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get 70 percent of the penetration of mobile phones in the developing world by the end of 2013.
Think about it, that dough warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from a smart mobile mobile with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever predicted.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- PGA video, images, images, images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology, now they are now developed and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when the applications are in health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Classic Foundation, something called the X Commissioner Prize Prize, of 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies into a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has AI, they can take, can be extracted blood from the dodo.
To win it has to make better diagnosis than a certified medical equipment.
So imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the stock burden is 25 percent, and there are 1.3 percent of health workers.
When this device sets up an RNA virus or DNA that I don't recognize the wellness of health, and first of all, prevent the pandemic happen.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion in the rise.
White lines here are the population.
We just had the brand of seven billion seven-shaped.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to empower the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll move from two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion minds never before ears to join global conversation.
What do you want these people?
What will you do? What do you want to do?
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the greatest economic incidence of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected into the global economy.
And you'll get healthier thanks to the Aristotle, from a better education with Academy Khan and due to the use of 3D printing and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more hungry members, healthy healthy and productive health members.
How about a few voices never before?
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and can be able to act for the first time?
What are these three billion dollars?
What if they're contributing that we can't predict prediction?
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams -- guided by their passion with a clear goal, they can do extraordinary things -- things that they used to only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish sharing a story that really excites me.
There is a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called Folditis.
He emerged at University University, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far it was a supercomputer problem.
They've played this college professors among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started playing.
And it's been shown that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better than folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the browser.
We have the capital of the jitney.
And we have three billion new minds that will join us to work in the solution of great challenges, and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The rise of the point of the game.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, let me give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1838.
You may believe that personal personalities, but it wasn't.
It actually collects fish.
And I described one of them as very common."
It was the mess.
I caught it a lot until the 1880s.
Now the fish is at the Red List of UNESCO.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're biased.
The leaflets still say they follow intact.
So what happens here?
Second story, also illustrates another concept: the shift of the waist.
Because I was there in 1957 studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate me.
I burned a lot to the sun and was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lake was surrounded by palms, and, as you can see, of a few mangrove mangroves.
There were little bits of about 20 centimeters -- the black bar.
And the fish of this line was very plentiful and it was going through a good time, so it was earning over the middle of Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had halved.
Madrid at five cents.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of arrested fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, I started in the 1980's, Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was able to impose the countries that were already 100,000 fish, imposing the industrial fisheries.
And this boat, quite ugly -- it's called the Mutant Four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in Southern China Sea of Media and above all, in the Japanese Sea.
What we captured was something unnameliant.
We captured now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were spores, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny blobs on a few remains, remains that are fish of coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then was thrown away.
These pictures are extraordinary. Because transition is very quick.
In one year, you do a studio, and then you start commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid gold of soft coral, in this case, to be a little bit.
This is a dead torture.
They didn't eat them. They downloaded them because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
It was not alienated.
Then they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they pick up the fishermen every time they go to an area where they've never caught fish.
But it's not documented.
We transformed the world, but we don't remember.
We put the point in the game, to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have good things: biodiversity, number of outside, the green of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do with nature.
Each generation will use the images that are received at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and exposing it forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the significance of changes.
And in the end, maintaining some missile remains.
And that, largely we want to do it now.
We want to keep things out there or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when the predator societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful before extinction, is unlikely.
You don't lose plentiful animals.
You lose a little bit frequent animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a senior sea of great fish.
They become slightly frequent because we caught them.
Over time, there are few fish, but we think that's the point.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, questioning it was very different.
And they do it because evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some people have, like Captain such and such a lot of fish in this area can't use, or usually don't use the science scientists, because it's not scientific."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in instrumental societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role that can make a marine marine area.
Because with the marine marine areas, we really recreated the past.
We recreated the past that people can't conceive because the point of game has been run away, and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a marine marine area and they can benefit from the vision that provides, which allows them to erase their point of cake.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle Media, for example?
I think there are art and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay, 500 years ago.
And you will have noticed that the musicians and the trouble are like "African-American."
And if you think about "Protection," if you think about why people got the film -- not talking about the story of the Posters -- why are you going to meet the pictures?
Because it raises something that, in some sense, has lost.
So my recommendation, the only thing to give, is Cameron to "Africa II" underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin Alley, the YouTube trend manager, and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why videos are made and how important that is.
We all want to be stars: celebrities sing, comedians -- when I was younger -- that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the Web video makes any of us, or our actions, covered in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can tickle on the Internet in a sandwich.
They climb over 48 hours of YouTube video per minute.
And, of those, just a small percentage of a little bit of a virtual machine receives vision and winning cultural momentum.
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, community and surprise.
Well, let's start that.
Beau Vaster: Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
Shih, wow!
KA: Last year, Berlin Square published this video filmed outside of his house in the National National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows the reproduction of the popularity of last summer.
Beautier is not a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called "The Mose Mountain Beard.
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So, what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimmer.
Jimmy Kimmer published this Tweet to kick the video to popularity video.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kimmer presents us and interesting things and devalue them to a broader audience.
Rebecca Black:  It's Friday, Friday, you have to start the Friday,  You all want to get the weekend, the weekend.  KA: Veras, Friday --  KA: You don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
"Veroses Black Verdes is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Like "Dr. "Goodbye went down, this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So, what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask these other people, they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday forest?
Well, Tom Tom and a lot of bloggers started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, of Missouri Science Thater, was one of the first people in making a joke about video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends are adopting a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about it and doing things.
And now there are 10 pounds of "Veroses on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every other day.
Unlike the 21st-century Western entertainment of the 20th century, this community is our way of being part of the phenomenon by spreading, or doing something new with it.
"Natalie Cat is a representative animation with a music chord.
So, that's it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three-minute version of three million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that sparked between the Internet Internet community.
There were replicators.
Someone made an ancient version of it.
And then it became internationally.
Suddenly, a whole community came up with a whole community of mixture that made this move from being a stupid joke to something we can all be part of.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted "Doctor Are Dravis Black or Rebelling Balinese or "Natalie Cat?"
What did you want to have written this situation?
In a world where you get two days of video per minute, just that really unique and unexpected thing can be broken out of the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great clip of a guy who protests against the helicopters in New York, I admit that I don't care too much.
Casey Nazi: I was struck by not circulating by the biocortical, but often there are obstacles.
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his husband, Casey Nazi made five million watched and understood his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Beautiful Vaster: What does this mean?
Ohio.
KA: What does this mean?
The trend creators, creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media culture, of a new culture, to which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity defines the popularity defines the popularity defines the popularity defines the popularity defines the popularity defines the popularity defines the popularity defines the popularity defines it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Berg, started on YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, it's barely the media today, but define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still standing.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece, a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a dramatic, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of oneness and freedom of his country.
So imagine that as the communist walks into Sangham, cutting the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, now they were sticking.
It was refugee in silence.
He died in the history of history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that be in a plane, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to pass us up, but we did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat when we slow down quietly into the sea.
My mother, Mai, was only 18 years old when his father died, and a concentrated marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been given to a task -- the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her to do it.
And after a four-foot centigrade that defies fiction, a boat was sliding towards the sea disguised sea ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the pedagors, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a climber with poison.
If they were captured, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, by diving on every wave and vacant and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came up several times, but they were angry with the suitcase of men on our boat, or the engine died and couldn't drop for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died -- finished the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men in the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, we broke in Melburi.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in Fortune, a class of class whose population is comprised with immigrants.
Unlike the middle class of medium, whose existence I was, in Fortune, there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of the controlled English would swap between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms and then on a line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title on IT technology.
We were poor.
All of the dollars were allocented, and established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what it was supposed to take off, which was usually new clothing.
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the robots, because it had to last six years.
And there were rare and painful shells about the eyes and some gratification, "As "As "As "Around home."
Honey, what?
Something in me is driven.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to go."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausting every night, but we were telling us about our day, and we heard the motions of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered stairs, all of the boat.
And my job was to be awake until his nightmare would start to wake it up.
She opened up a grocery store, then I studied to be a strategy and opened another business.
And women came up with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and inevitable children trapped between two worlds.
They were selfish and paraplegic.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, unpleasant with what was demanding myself.
In the other, I was locked in precise lives, tragically squashed by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many received help over the years.
And by that work, when I studied my last year, I was elected by the Australian youth of the year.
And I was pleased from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
And so I read Angela Angela, it was now so League, refugee and social activist invited to speak in places that I had never heard of, and at home, whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use covered.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the routine and the comfort of life in a suburban suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling about the day of each and getting asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom, I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when we got into the ship.
The node had never been an option.
"Go "Stop," he said, "And you're not what you are."
So I talked about youth and education and defending to the marginalized and the deforestation.
And the more frankly he talked about, the more it was solitary to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, many of them doing what they love, living on the frontier of the possible.
And although I finished my library, I realized that I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
There had to be another piece of puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly come to the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something to be grateful, maybe a gift of the vessel.
Because being inside it can easily mean to climb the horizons -- it can easily mean accepting the pressures of your purpose.
I gave them enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is demoralized, but not the way we fear it.
Possibilities that would not have been allowed to be encouraged tremendously.
There was an energy there, a relentless optimism mix of humility.
So I kept my intuition.
I put a little group of people for whom the slogan can't be done was a relentified challenge.
For one year, we didn't have a center.
By the end of every day, I was making a giant sheet of soup that we all share.
We worked at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened steps.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My heart again.
Three months later, and the adventure continued.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the Consumer was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it alone.
At the age of 17, it turned into a Mandarin whose mother was hitting her.
With no support of his husband, he caused a reserve when they sue it and take the cause themselves, and much more revealed caused when they won.
It can't be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in Sydney, when she died, at 1,000 miles in Melbourne Mellow.
I looked through the marker of the shower and saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I'd come to be ready.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Fortune and we sat around her.
We told him stories and we made sure we were still with it.
On the night a monkey came up and told us that he had to close the attack.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked him to the monkey: "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so cool?"
"Because you've taken your hand from the morning, he said.
"They're not said.
If there's a nerve in our family that runs through women.
Since we were and how life formed us, we can now see that the men who had reached our lives would have been frustrated.
The defeat would have been easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about shipping.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing, of the right.
Can I give them a little bit of their lives, suggesting brave in every wave -- the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe. I would do it.
Thirty Newson and also the mother of the mother is in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in Randolphia about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sealed sky with the singer Mushroom Alis.
We were talking about how nothing has changed since the ancient Indian Egyptian Egypt "The Gabby."
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a chariot and fix the sky.
Now we do it with airplane.
At the time when Armstrong, the great Indian warrior prince -- he had a thirsty and he would take a bow.
Now we do the same thing with drills and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machine had replaced magic.
And that struck me very much.
Every time I felt a little bit more technically.
I was terrified this idea of losing the ability to enjoy, and appreciate a reasoning if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't throw it to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic.
As a child my grandfather gave me his remote silver release.
And this technology piece of 50 years was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door towards a world full of images, and pirates and narratives in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and luxury clocks.
They feel our inspiration.
And so I got rid of this technology world to see how to use magic, rather than killing it.
It illustrates books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the picture, animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly multi-former.
But what do we do that?
I'm about to launch Khinest, an interactive app for iPad.
He says, "You put your fingers on every light."
And so --  says, "This box belongs to ..." I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
In a number of moments, there's a letter -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child is thrilled with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons, but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we get from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always exciting me.
So, over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, you illuminate your path in the rest of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me as a child was that a whole galaxy would spit on a ball.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a pen that I draw towards this magical device into the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy, fantasy, there's always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, fluid and guide you through the rest of the book.
At some point in the book it unfolds.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and at the time.
These are the passwords.
We've all heard of the fairies and the numbers, but how many people outside India knew their Indian contracts, would you take them?
These poor would have been stuck on the cameras of India for millennia, in an old and sharp book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And, talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been locked up, pasted to their PCs, haven't been left to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect pictures of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections: palms, stones, judges and containers.
For some reason children don't do it.
So to reclaim this ritual of childhood, you have to go out and, in a chapter, take a photo to a flower and then tag it.
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then tag it.
So it's created a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a ship and says, "Oh, I saw a store."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And it creates this sort of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taken.
Within the variations of connection between the magic, the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we are trying to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad, and the video switched up and through augmented you see a group of animals that appear on indoor plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and fix them so you can read the rest of the book.
Let's go to a world where the forces of nature are intertwined with technology and magic and technology come up with each other.
We take advantage of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many health projects fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at Rubin University, was to spread a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, and she got a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and known -- what happened?"
"How can we help?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the health projects fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Spinosaurus scarce. It's very simple.
It has a strain of lit and shut down.
Every morning I get up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 lbs.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect to it, I send my information to Google Heather.
And my doctor doctor has access to him too, so he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when he needs circulative assistance or some urgency of that style but see it back.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my skilled scanner and before I climb my car, people start to talk to me: Lucy, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people out of their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week will be available.
This little blurry attached to an iPhone or another device.
And people can, from their homes, take their blood pressure, send it to their clinician, and share it with others, for example, 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they re-engage the control and to be capitalists from their own boat -- but they can also help care of health care, because of the challenges that we face, as the shoe of measures of medicine, decomposing demand and other themes.
To perform techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through cross-sucker.
And one of the things that we did to share with you with a video video.
We all have Christmas navigation in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM carriers are in Marcheal.
Also where all the gasoline is.
And of course, we can find food food chain.
But where is the nearest DARPA to help this patient?
We asked ourselves, but nobody knew about.
No one knew where to get the DECT saving lives right now.
What we did was we did crowdsources in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to "The Public Satellite: You see a DARPA, please send it off, give them where, and when open is open, because sometimes open up in hours of office and others are locked.
And over 10,000 DARPA already showed up in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app to Lawrence, augmented reality, to find these DARPA.
And every time they are in the city of Marcoro and somebody collapses, they can use their iPhone, and the weeks following their mobile cell to find the nearest DARPA, which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not only like DARPA 47, which is the name of the product, but also like DARPA.
And we'd like to start it globally.
We're looking at all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work as a center for the DRAIC corridor around the world.
Every time you're in vacation and somebody collapses, it can be a patient or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us to validate these DARPA.
They could be serious messages or phone services, for example, to see if the DECT that shows is still in place.
Please, hate them and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it photograph?
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15.
It was mixed with my previous passion, but it was a little bit different, because when I used the camera the camera was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when you press the pulse.
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the pulse.
Pictures like this: a construction on a very crowded road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And, despite that, it keeps a level of reality.
Or pictures like these -- dark, and color at once, but with the common goal of keeping the level of reality.
And when I say realistic I say photosynthesis.
Because, of course, it's not something that I can capture but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photographer.
Photos where you have to think about a moment to discover the tricks.
It has more to capture an idea than to capture a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them look real?
Are the detail or color?
Do you understand?
What's the illusion?
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality, and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly unimaginable objects, something that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that looks 3D, as if it exists.
But, at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we deceived the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining photography.
It's really going to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic -- I think that's those where we don't even think about things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs, it's very important to consider it, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures combined to have the same kind of light.
And these two pictures are going to be taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning, and the end of the different images with a perfect joint.
It has to be impossible to see where the image was made.
Here's another example.
I could think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is manipulated.
But this image is totally composed by photographs of different places.
Personally, I think it's easier to create a place than finding it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different location for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The costs are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a piece of stone.
And yes, I even cheated the top of the island to look cooler.
So to achieve a realistic result I think it's missing planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well thought.
If you do a good job when you take the photos, the result can be very beautiful, and at the very realistic way.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it ...
It's a diagram anyone who took from a folder.
I'm not interested in showing you the details.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of R&D microprocessors versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like many other ones that we tend to see, is sort of a straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude, at the scale of performance.
Speaking technology with symbolic curves is something new.
Here's a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please, turn out the lights.
It would need more intensity, because writing about paper.
Why do we draw technology curves into logarithmic scales.
The answer is, if I draw them in a normal curve where we say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to draw, the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell you a lot.
But if I joke, for example, some other technology, like transport, in a semi-autonomous curve would be very dumb to see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology would move as fast as microscopic microscopes, we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move at that rate.
There are no precedent in the history of the technology development of a refugee growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these exponential curves -- we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It will happen one of two things.
Or it will become a typical Yes curve like this, until it gets something completely different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we're in a transition of what used to be the world, a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is: what's that new shape that embraces the world?
How new state is the world?
The transition looks very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has shrunk.
But I think that's because something is happening.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all going to be so different than exposing what we're doing today is no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it could be, how could that transition that we experience it.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we took about 2,500 billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that float around it.
If we look at the way that we organized these chemicals, we give a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, I had floating some oil droplet with all kinds of chemicals inside her inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside, and so the droplets grew up.
And they started to divide.
In some sense, those were the most primitive mobile forms, those oil glasses.
But those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them had a recipe of chemicals.
And every time they were divided, they had an unequal distribution of chemicals that they contained.
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow became better at the time of incorporating the chemical chemicals -- they grew more and more chemical and they divide more.
They usually lived longer, they were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemical, very simple life, but things got interesting when these droplets learned the abstraction of abstraction.
Somehow we didn't understand these droplets learned to store information.
They learned to guard information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this evolutionary evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to replicate.
The amazing thing is that the writing system seems to have remained stable since they evolved 2,500 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same science system.
In fact, every living will be alive with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did for fun -- now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 milligrams of white dust that tries to hide people from security security.
But it -- I took this code, and the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this DNA clip and amplified it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have many for all the presents -- in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was an eBay would have put it into a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What's the next step?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells were happy another billion years.
But then another big step was interesting when things became very different, and it was that these cells started exchanging and communicate information forming that community of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can swap DNA.
That way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin, and they moved them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistance, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that were in a way, and they were together on it.
That way they survived or fail together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community was more and they were favorable by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe of the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have multicellular communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we're a cultural community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or muscles or so forth.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting than the cellphone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
These are starting to absorb information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than processing information in community.
They're the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities built in.
In fact, they started to specialize within the community being responsible to record, understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as individuals, the learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen for the life of an organism given that they had previously built these structures of information processing the evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system builds those structures of information to hugely accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trial of communication.
So, for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a vague idea, in my head.
I'm here sitting here emitting some groups and hopefully building a similar idea, vagina and confusing, in their heads that hold some analogy with me.
But we take something very complicated, we become sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started doing abstractions.
Now we go through similar periods to the multicellular organisms, abstract our methods of record, present and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The telephone, the I.T. cassette tape, CRISPR, etc. It's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary example of T in which it produced some evolution with the Consumer program, to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years apiece.
The next stage, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next ones, language, and so forth, took less than a million years.
And the next ones, like electronics, seems just a few decades.
The process is refused. I guess that controlling is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it became, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process refuse.
But I won my life designing computers and I know the mechanisms that I use to design them would not be possible without recent computer breakthroughs.
But now design objects that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that it does every transistor in that machine of connection.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of Think Malcolms, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you could not before could, it gets much further away and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it employed methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method, which I've been using lately is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And, for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve.
We said, "Please, computer, you can run 100 million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, exercise all those programs, and take those who are more about what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them succeeded.
But one, luckily, he could put two numbers in the right order.
And I said, "Computer," could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task?
We put those and eliminate the rest.
And now we reproduce the numbers.
And let's reproduce them following a process of analog reconfiguring to sex."
Let's take two programs, that bring kids together, that exchange suburbs, and that children inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little bit more successfully.
And we say, "Please, repeating the process."
California again.
You bring some mutations in.
And it tries again and represent another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases in a few hours.
By the end, we end up with programs that are ordered numbers of absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to answer them to see how they work.
They're dark programs, strange programs.
But they make the compound.
In fact, I do have the safety, I have the safety, because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that succeeded.
In fact, their lives depended on doing it.
Once I was in a 747 with Martin Minnesota and pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "This airplane has hundreds of thousands of particles that work together to offer a safe flight -- doesn't it make you feel like?"
We know that engineering processes don't work very well.
So we started to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the people who produce normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, so we can run these programs much more rapidly.
I mean, it feeds.
The thing goes faster and faster, and so I think it seems so confused.
Because all these technologies are refused.
We are representing.
And we're at an analog moment to the clinical organisms when they became multi-built.
We are the landscapes, and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We are at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever comes from.
But now comes the lunch, and I think I'll stop here before I get eliminated.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a physician, and that's me.
And I exercise enough time to allow me to get part of my fake presence in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We are near the end, the World Wide Access.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of astonishing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's just going to be "remarkably "Regularly -- talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them, and I hope many of you know it.
It's called battle average.
And we talked about 300.
That means that bioluminescent battle effective, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being caught, and that anyone who tries to launch it to the first base -- don't get in time, and the second foundation will be saved.
Three trials of 10.
You know what they call a 300 burner ball in the Great Lights?
Well, really, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a 400 baseball battle battle?
By the way, that's some of the 10 hits -- it takes four.
Legal Legonia, as the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Great League League player in executing more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's bring this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have appearances and they are developed to a surgeon who has a 400 percent record in approaches.
That's not working, right?
Now suppose that they live in a crowded place, and a loved will have two manned coronary arteries and their family doctor at a cardiologist whose record in angiogenesis is 200 dollars.
But, you know what?
She's actually getting this year.
And they have been 257.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think should be the average of a heart surgeon, or orthopedic or a nurse or a binary obstacle?
1,000 very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the states of a good surgeon, or a doctor or a paradigm.
What we do, though, is to send them into the world, and I include, with the standard of being perfect.
That never, never, make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I absorbed when I was in medical school.
I was an observational observation student.
Once, a company in high school said that Brian Goldie studied to a blood test.
That's why.
I studied in my little decline, in the nurses of nurses of the General hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all the memory.
From my anatomy class, I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artifact that comes out of the air, and frequent and non-verbal difference.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify kidney auditorium assistants.
And as more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated with honor.
And stresses from medicine school with the impression that if I memorized everything, then I would know everything -- or the most possible thing, close to everything, because this is how I would impose the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mr. Drught.
I was a resident at a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the Syrian lady to the emergency service where I was working.
At that time, I was assigned to the cardiology service.
And when emergency emergency was going to take a cardiologist, I took to attend to that patient.
And I'll report the boss of residents.
When I saw Mrs. Dr. was blind.
I heard a remarkable sound.
And when I looked at it, I listened to a sound refused on both sides, which was telling me a sympathetic heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pumping blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, and these are full of blood, and so there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnosis.
I did it and work on the treatment that I would give him.
He gave him aspiration and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
I gave him directors, pills of water, so he could eliminate liquid limit.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first mistake, sent it home.
In fact, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the Chief beast.
I didn't pick up the phone and did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and consume it with him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to provide complicated information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would require constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility, that I could take care of my patients without compromising my boss.
The second mistake I ate was worse.
By sending her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my underwear that said, "Good, it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure, I asked the nurse to take care of Miss Drug: "Do you think it's okay if you go home?
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'll be OK."
I remember that as if I was yesterday.
So he signed up high, and the ambulance alongside with the paradigms took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad job in the gut.
But I kept my job.
By the end of the day, I stood up to leave the hospital and walked into the parking park where my car was to go home. At that time I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency emergency service.
And there was another nurse, not the one who was taking care of Mr. Drug before, but another one, and he told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists fear it too, but there's a particular in emotional emergency, and it's that we see the patients fluidly.
The three words is: Do you remember you?
"Do you remember the patient who sent your home?"
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"Well, she said, "Fine, with the same tone of voice.
She went right.
But I went back to death.
By an hour of having arrived at home, after I gave him his high, he suffered a collapse, and his family named 9/11 -- the ambulance was brought to emergency with an area of 50 feet of Haiti, which means a severe shock.
I barely respected and was blue.
The emergency staff displaced all its resources.
They gave him medication to raise the arterial pressure.
And they put an artificial restriction.
I was shocked and rocked up to the core.
I had a mixture of feeling because after the establishment was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that was going to recover.
And in the two or three days afterward, it was obvious that I would never wake up.
I had a terrible brain damage.
The family gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, they signed up to what was happening.
And on the ninth day, they let her go, "Ladies Drug, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The following weeks later, I screamed for it, and I experienced for the first time the marshal shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, isolation, without feeling that healthy embarrassment because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You do the passes and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teach.
The killer shame that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very wrong inside it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that sat down.
And it wasn't by my boss, he was a love.
I talked to the family and I'm sure I supported things and make sure that they wouldn't decline.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss, "Why did it send her to his house?
And in my worst moments, why did such a stupid mistake?
Why did I choose medicine?
Little by little that feeling was disappearing.
And I started feeling better.
And in a neuronable day, it opened up the sky and finally came out the sun and asked me if I felt better again.
And I did a deal with myself when the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, I would make those voices fit.
And so it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was going to help in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I received a 25 year-old man with a pain on the barrier.
I was very busy and shed.
And he pointed up here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little colored.
He asked him, penicillin and sent him home.
But as he goes to the door he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to my guard change, my boss asked me to talk to calm with calm quiet in his office.
And then the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the bar?
Well he came back, and he had no strategic professionals.
I had a potentially deadly basis called Egyptians.
You can find it in Google -- it's an infection, not from the throat, but from the upper air track, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He would, luckily, did not leak.
He was administered with introverted analysis and recovered.
And I went through the same period of embarrassment and replicators, then I was relieved back and forth, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Twice in the same E.R. disorder, no approaches.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because you're attending 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a disconnect.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They ordered a river radio, but it turned out normal. A colleague who was revising patient was a certain sensitivity on the bottom right quadrant and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to rediscover and asked my colleague to check him.
You reviewed it, and you noticed a certain sensitivity on the bottom right, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered well.
But every case was stuck to me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and like many colleagues say, it's a bear.
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
Only shaming and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't release myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the film that tells me what really happens to me, how can I share this with my colleagues?
How do I show you this to make the same mistakes?
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party listening to the errors of other doctors, but not listening to somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a translator in my hospital took the wrong leg, believe me that I would have difficulty to look at her eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions -- the ones that make mistakes, and the ones who don't, the ones who can't sleep, and the ones who have sense results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we move from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a personal study of bad medical and medical professors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Tour Toronto to my show, "Whoa Cocar, Blake Cock, Black Cocaria, Black Cocaria, Black Art Art Brazilian."
And what I learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous.
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one out of 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong, or definition is not right. In a system where hospital-acquired infection is increasingly more and more numerous -- causing havoc and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian medical mistakes.
The U.S. Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's crude substances, because we're not destroying the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't get involved.
Sleep deprivation.
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes up with bright eyes and with alien to alcohol, and suddenly my story is out of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot. I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't do their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system as they taught us, and we remove all the professionals prone to mistake, well, no one's going to stay.
And with respect people don't want to talk about their more serious cases?
In my show, "Slow white, black art, it's a custom to say, "This is my worst mistake. I would tell you all, from the E.R. parachutes, "This is my worst mistake, blah blah blah blah -- "What are your mistakes?" And it would steer the microphone to them.
And their students would stop, they would go back, they would go down the head and they swallow salary and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to say, "Look, don't do the same mistake."
They need a context where they can do it.
They need redefining medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The rehabilitation physician is human, it knows human, it accepts it, and it's not proud of its mistakes, but it forces to learn from what's happening to teach others.
They share their experiences with them.
It's support for those who are talking about their mistakes.
It points out the mistakes of other people not with intention to catch them, but in a nurturing, supportive way for everybody to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are going to direct the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes, sometimes.
My name is Brian Goldie.
I'm a redefined doctor.
I'm a human, I make mistakes.
And I'm very excited about learning something that can convey others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions do we take a day want?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey to over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to choose an average American, it's about 70 percent a day.
Not very much, in a research followed for a week to a group of emergency presidents group.
Researchers recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time they used to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found, on average, 133 jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of ministries.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of his time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of you are an hour?
How do you rank those decisions?
Today I want to talk to you today about one of the biggest issues of current -- to choose to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
While I'm talking about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to meet their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your response is positive, please give you a paradox.
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of operation of options?
Thank you.
By being a graduate student at Stanford University, it was a very high level of level -- at least at least at the time at least in that time I was very sophisticated.
His name was Dragons.
It was almost like going to a different park park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar, over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 employees. And this was when we took water from the chart.
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, he asked me, why would I never buy anything?"
This is the silver of the olive oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in the sealed box that came from military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, "Did it work well this strategy to offer all these options?"
He pointed up the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with his cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the store.
She happened.
They had 48 different classes.
We installed a post to disconcert, right at the entrance of the tent.
We stood there six-year-olds, or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to stop the melody?
More people stopped when there was 24, 60 percent, that when there was only six percent, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a vegetable bar.
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was 24, only three percent came to buy melody.
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent melody purchased it.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy melody if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy metastasion is probably a good time to conserve the line -- but it turns out that the problem of operation is affecting us in good decision-making decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't convince us.
Now the theme of the day, financial savings.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with Gurret Huntington, Emerge Kamen and Wei Jane, where we observe the decisions about savings for a million Americans, from between about 600 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of forces available on supply plans for retirement, the 404 program -- triggered people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a correlation, actually.
We had 567 plans that ranged from two to 50 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of fund offered offered -- there was less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of involvement was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And on the plans that offered about 60 funding, the rate of involvement went to the percentage 60 percent.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those of those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, the more people were inclined by the actions or the hedge funds.
As soon as the options, they were more willing to invest in financial conceptions of markets.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would recommend to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences of offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that you get the decision, that the app even when this goes against interest.
They're more likely to make the worst decisions in finance, and in health.
They're more likely to pick up less satisfying things, although objectively gives them better.
The main reason is that we get to look at that gigantic variety of mass, mustard mustard and vinegar, and melody, but we are not able to do the calculations to compare and counteract and choose that amazing display.
Today I want to propose to you four simple techniques that we have tried, in one way or another, in different research, so that they can rehearse their business.
The first one, Cut.
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, "Cook.
They care about losing space on the area.
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of strange reduction options, there's going to be an increase in sales, you will lower costs, there's a better experience in choice.
When Proctor & Gamma companies from 26 different types of Heidi & Shares to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Goldman Corporation Cathed removes the products for granted cats.
You know that supermarkets, on average offer 45,000 products.
In a shop of Walmart they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is Alexander and offers only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato tomato sauce on board.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to manage the choices is David Labarian, the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically engaged to a support of life insurance.
They really want to pick up, they offer 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to cut down.
These are all important options.
The first thing I do is ask the employees: "Tell me the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't differentiate you either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Gary.
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience with everything paid to the most beautiful road of the world.
Here, a description here.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give a applause if you're ready to take the Garbage supply.
(Pictures of good. Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
Aren't they else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a catch.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think it really reached more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round than in the second, but I can post myself and say that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the problem of choices, which is Concrete.
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must be very rapidly, very cool.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses credit cards or credit, that when it uses effectiveness?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Sherman Benjamlin and Alexander Prevalence, about NGO officials who worked at INCRA -- these people were in a meeting where they were being claimed to a 404 plan.
That meeting, which we thought was exactly the way we used to do it a little addict.
What we added was we asked the staff to think about positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this ministry there was an increase in the attraction of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their savings accounts for four percent.
The third technique is to classify.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that at the Webbart supermarkets across the river of the northeast, the magazine exhibition can contain from 333 different types to 665.
But, you know?
Because climate tells me how to differentiate them.
These are two jewelry exhibitions.
One is called "Japanese and the other "Super Super."
If you think the left on the left is Switzerland, and the one on the right is Jasa, they give a palm.
(Pieces of all -- well, there are some of those.
If you think the left on the left is Japan and the one on the right is Switzerland, they give a palm.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Japan and the one on the right is Switzerland, but you know what?
This layering schema is totally useless.
The categories have to tell you something to choose not to define them.
Often you see this problem with these huge funding lists.
Do you bet who are informing?
My fourth category: Condender complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very complicated decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows you to personalize it.
You've got to take 60 decisions, to raise the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one.
Colored colors -- I have 56 possibilities.
Motorized, boxes box, four options.
So what I'm going to do is assess the order where the decisions appear.
So half of customers are going to go from many options, 56 colors, to a few boxes, four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to take a few options, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look at in?
How much involved.
If you connect the button by default, in every decision, this tells you that you're overwhelmed and you are losing it.
We found that those who go from many choices to a few options, push the button, over and over again, and another more.
We miss them.
If you go from a few options, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order that the information is presented.
If you start with easy, you learn to choose.
Although choosing the box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of interior drivers, in all ways we prepare to choose to choose to choose to choose to choice.
We are thrilled by a product that we're building that now has more empowered with the process.
To sum out.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of options -- Current, eliminating strange alternatives." Contract, make it real. It's really -- we can handle more categories with fewer options, to address complexity.
All of these techniques that I presented to them were designed to help manage the alternatives or better, for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who are serving.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful by choosing.
And the more careful we're going to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980's, in the communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter of writing to the government.
There was to register a text sheet, written with the machine.
And this for government to track the origin of text.
If they came up with the wrong message, they could track the footprints to the order of the idea.
In the West, we didn't realize that somebody could do this, how much it would limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturing and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow pigs printed on every page that makes it a pattern that makes it your own pattern of one and your printer.
That is happening today.
And nobody seems to engage a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the world online, we can draw the attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
There are the cybercriminals.
Like Mr. Dimitri Boldward Bulley in Ukraine.
The mobile phone cell is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, smart quantities.
There are really many cases of millions online, multiple cases that won money with their attacks.
This is Valley Station, from Tarahum, Stone.
This is Alfred Gonzalle.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Bernie Sunday.
These are Matthew Anderson, Taiwan Albardez and so forth, etc.
These guys do their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal troops to steal money from our beads when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy an infected computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, froze the Swiss account of this gentleman Sam Jay, and this has 14 million dollars when he was frozen.
Mr. Jang said, "Self was done by blink.
And I say today is more likely than any of us are victims of a cyber than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from wrong in worse.
In the future, most of the crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we observe today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate the views, they motivate laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have documented over the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks: criminals who do it for money, the machines like Anonymous who do it to protect and the last group are the national states that they attacked.
And then we see cases like Dignitism.
That's a good example of government attacks against its own citizens.
Digital is a certificate authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
Decomposing the war the last fall because of a sharp.
They clung the safety of the site and they pasted a cybercriminal.
Last week I asked, in a meeting with representatives of Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people because of Diangle to Dignit.
And the answer of him was yes.
So, how do people die?
Digital authority is a certified authority.
They sell certificate.
What do you serve the certificates?
Well, they need if you have a website with high-tech, self-confident services, services like Gammin.
Except to intercept a foreign confident authority.
And they emit certified applications.
And in the case of Dignitanian happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt.
Well, in Egypt, the Gezi protesters took the headquarters of the Egyptian police secret in 2011, and during the surface of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this calculator called "USC."
And within that folder there was notes of a company with severe in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept large scale the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 2008 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago a couple of weeks ago, a Trojan used by official government officials to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is interventiously.
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection.
They're going to use even tools like the Trojan Survey to infect our computer with a Trojan to allow them to see all the communication and listen online discussion to get our data.
When we think about things like this, the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm a honest citizen.
Why would you care?
I have nothing to hide.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's at stake.
Privacy is not dispute.
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right we have to do today will be forever.
We will blindly trust any future government in an administration, which could we have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here's where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cow, the National National Park.
Nairobi National Park has no close to most of the south, which means that wild animals like babies migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like lions and follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of those who killed at night, and as soon we stood up in the morning and we found it dead and I felt very bad because it was the only taboo we had.
My community, the masses, we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to test them, and that's why we value them so much.
So I grew up hating the lions.
They are the warriors who protect our community and won, and they're also mad with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National National Park.
A child in my community, of the six at nine, is responsible for his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions would give them fear.
But I realized that I really didn't service, because I even helped the lions to see the star of far away.
I didn't give me. I continued.
A second idea was to use a shell scanner.
He was trying to deceive lions to believe that he was near the stage.
But lions are very clever.  They came the first day and saw the sheets, and they went, but the second day, they came back and they said, "This thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped and kill animals.
So one night was walking around the stage with an oven, and that day lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light to move.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to learn and turn the lights out.
And this is a little lamp of a broken flashlight.
I dialed everything.
As you can see, the solar panel burden the battery and the battery supply electricity to the little Indian box, I call it a transformation.
And the indicator box makes the lights flash down.
As you can see, the light bulbs go outside, because that's where the lions come from.
And this is how lions look at it when they come at night.
The lights flash and send the lions to think that I'm walking through the stage, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
I put them up. You can see the fund, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to scare other predators like hydrogen, letters, and it's also being used to pack elephants from the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brooklyn International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and awareness.
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to put them.
So, a year ago, it was only a child in the Saturday sheets by shaking the cows.
And here I am.
I got the chance to come in airplane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving my dad's cow and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
Alaska waves. What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You can't imagine how exciting a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard Turkey: Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on your list?
LT: My next invention is -- I want to do an electrical Near Climate Near Near Clicks.
LT: I know you already invented electric fences already, but I want to do mine.
CA: So you try it once, right? And you -- LT: I've tried it before, but I got a calm clear.  CA: At the foot, Richard Turkey, you're a big thing.
We're going to stick on every step that you know, my friend.
Thank you very much. ROD: Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Not Seventh China."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim Superman history, but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea is the enemy.
Although sometimes I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I'd spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven, I saw my first public exercise.
But I thought my life in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and myself had never happened.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleagues.
That said, "When you read this, the five family members will stop exist in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're lying together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die."
I was very hot.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
By the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one helped them because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge hunger in North Korea.
By the end, more than a million North Koreans died during hunger, and just a few of them survived pastor, insects and trees cortex.
They also became more and more frequencies, the energy cuts -- all around me was entirely dark on the night except by sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a state of North Korean at night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the Amarta River, which serves the limits between North Korea.
As you can see, the river can be very sticky at certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross suddenly.
But many die.
Sometimes I see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I exited North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with distant patients.
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a North Republican.
But I soon learned that it's not only hard, but also dangerous, because North Koreans were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be replicated to a horrific fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was interested in the police station.
Someone had been accused by being a northeastern, so they tested my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it wasn't natural, it could be incarcerated and depressed.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
At the end of the interrogation one official told another, "This was a fake report -- she's not Norway."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China search for asylum.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese cops and depressed.
These women had a lot of luck.
Although they had caught them, they were essentially released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were so lucky.
Every year, unconscious North Koreans are captured in China and departments to North Korea.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, the whole world can be embedded in an instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk myself going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
In South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
I also understood that there was a great gap between North and South.
We're all Koreans, but inside, we've become very different from 67 years of divide.
Even through an identity.
Am I a strong stream or a Northeast?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with pride myself.
Although I adapted to life in Southern Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the example of income to university.
Just when I started adapting to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities were interrogated with some money that sent my family sent to my family, and, as punishment, my family was going to be shifted to force to the force to a location in the outside.
They had to rush immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, in some ways, for over 3,000 miles across China, and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in bus took a week and almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by an official police officer.
He asked the identification, and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, I was overwhelmed by my family, and I said that they were deaf people who was compared.
I looked at myself, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the Laws border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards in Laws.
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned by crossing the border.
After paying crutches and bores, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the Lawson capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was revered in prison prison at the distance of South Korea.
I was going in between the immigration office and police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribe or helices.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask me, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained to him the situation, and certainly the man went to the ATM burden and gave me the rest of the money for my family, and for other two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I thanked him with my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I help me?"
"I'm not helping you." He said.
"I'm helping the North North."
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The key stranger symbolized a new hope for me and for the northern town when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the North Korean needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But managing its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they go up to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices, work practice and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea.
Because many of us continue to continue with family and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea.
I've been very lucky, I have received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans growing around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Central Center.
This is Centre Street: Store stores, rapid food, ball land.
So the planners in the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of Southern Central to represent something more, so they changed it to Los Angeles Southern -- as if this will fix what's wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles Southern Angeles --  Sweeney: Store food, rapid food, ball land.
As 265 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, L.A. Central Center, home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring people more people than food in the car.
People are dying of curious diseases in Los Angeles Central Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times bigger than, say, Berker Hillis -- that's about 15 miles away.
I tend to see that this happens.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you get out of house you see the harmful effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood?
I see chairs of broken wheels and sold as cars.
I see centers of pulse dilutes like Starbucks.
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I'm also tired to handle 45 minutes away and turned to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
On a sliver of land we call a garden.
It's 45 meters three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to win, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
That's how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green. Green Grounds, we put together and we started to plant our food forest, fruit trees -- you know, nine full vegetables.
So what we do, we are sort of a group of a group paid by adverse of all the processions, all of the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then somebody got burned.
The city came up with me on top of it, and in summary, they gave me a quote saying that I had to withdraw my yard, the cycling became a courthouse.
And I said, "Come on, really?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that no one does it matter?"  Then I was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time was not going to happen.
L.A. Times had the history written by Steve Lower, and he talked to the concern and one of the members of Green Groups, who put a petition in Changeov, with 900 signatures -- we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My concentration was even called, and they loved what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more balls balls.
It has 68 miles of ball land.
That's about 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 725 million plants of tomato plants.
Why the hell doesn't look like this?
Growing a plant to give about a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar of straws will give you 75 dollars of results.
It's my hypertension, when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
Growing your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern Central Center.
I grew up there. I grew up my kids there.
I became part of this manufacturing reality that was manufactured for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The garden is my graffition, I cultivate my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who runs walls, I removed soils, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas and plants and the trees, are my rise to that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth can do.
You can't just imagine how amazing a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a tool of education, of transformation.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects the kids.
The garden is the most therapeutic and provocative act you can do, especially in a wheel.
They also get fat.
I remember an occasion, who came up with a mother and his daughter, they were like 13 o'clock in the night and they were in my yard, and they looked very low.
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, they don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this just reinforces why I do this, and people ask me, "Well, don't you fear people will steal your food?"
I mean, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to steal it."
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at your time, I want you to take your health."
There was another occasion, where I put a garden in a refugee shelter.
There were these guys, who helped me to download the truck.
It was fabulous. I shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant her mother and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so just for a moment.
So Green Groups have come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, work and participate, all in voluntary plan.
If kids grow up, kids will eat color.
If you cultivate tomatoes -- you eat tomatoes --  But if none of this is taught you, if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, you eat blind people what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're stuck in. I see color kids who are on this path designed for them, who doesn't take them anywhere.
With the garden, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are charged from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you produce the next George Washington Carrier.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plan, this is something I want to do.
I want to plan a whole block, where people can share food in the same picture.
I want to bring containers and convert them into healthy cafes.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because I'm not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability is you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is to try to work with people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of cultivating their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do it sexy.
I want everybody to become ecological recommenders, gas, garbage gardens.
We have to change the script of what's a gas.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gase.
You know, the geese take your palm right?
That is their choice weapon.
In addition, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with his palette so that we could plant something.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Sound noise)  (First of the microscopes."  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of strawberry, and the package is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that sales down.
And especially if you go up on your bicycle and these cars pass, that's not very nice.
Also, the package can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would like a silent road jacket.
The solution for that is to make pornography roads.
The pig postal, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, it has pores, and the water can pass through it, so all the rainwater rainwater will flow down to the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and they won't be slowing water.
Noise will also disappear.
Because it's very hollow -- the whole noise will disappear, so it's a very simple road jacket.
It also has disappearances, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can dispose it.
What is that that is ready? Look at that road the surface stones come out.
First one stone, then several more and more and more and more, and then -- well, you know, I'm not going to do that.  But then you can damage your parachutes, and you're not happy with it.
And, finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
Oh, that's ready.
Baches, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can see really how damage comes in this material.
It's a porous, as I said, so it only has a little amount of addition between stones.
Due to the interference, to the light of the light, to the oxytocin, this administration, this beauty, the glue between the strings, is going to be drowned, and if you get married, you're going to become microphones and separate from the addition.
So, if they drive down the road, they will take the adapter -- as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about retropion materials.
If we can make this material behave itself, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we use steel floating, and we can cut the steel plate into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the button.
So we have lack with little bits of steel tuna on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- a machine of industry.
The industry can heat, especially steel, is very good at it.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the button, the button will flow through these microphones and the stone is going back to the surface.
Today, I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big driver machine here onstage.
The microwave airplane is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the laboratory to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try."
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters from the 2008 highway, where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road, and we tested them in the laboratory.
We did aging the sample, we put a lot of burden on them, we would repair them with our signal machine and we repair them and we handed them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers, incorporating these fibers, using the information energy to actually raise the lives of the surface of the road, can even double the life of the road, and it really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before I can show you how the repair act.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the glass in my house.
My father was listening to CBS News.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because news usually depressed.
"The Taliban was beaten, screamed my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a state school, he said.
One morning I'll never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came out of Afghanistan and made illegal illegal girls that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a child to escort my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could suspend where we were.
We had to hide the books in the market bags to look like we were shopping.
School was in a house, over 100 of us were caught in a little room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew that we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school was closed for a week because the Taliban supported them.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we live?
We were embarrassed, but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a sense.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total infrastructure of a remote province, in Afghanistan, insisted in his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father repeated it.
But my mother was educated.
This is it.
It will retreat, two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhoods.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk not to educate his children.
Over the years of the Taliban, I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, "Hmm, daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can force your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still don't want to continue?"
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the backpack, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate at Merchum College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was exiled from his home for the courage of educating his daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate his daughters.
He doesn't just take care of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who carried it through the streets of Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 101, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLEs, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like me, advocate for them, despite and still in front of a defeated opposition.
Like Ahmed. It's not its true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmedabad is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter was walking from SOL to his village, and, literally, they escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When he arrived at home, they are the phone, a voice advised him that if he kept sending her child to school, they would go back to it.
Leave me already, if you want." He said, "But I won't give the future of my daughter by his old and ready ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom we succeeded, there's a parent who recognized the value of his daughter and sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often they are the first compelling interpretators of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school, they count in hundreds -- remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find Americans see the fragility of change.
I fear these changes don't last long after the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents that advocate for them, that encouraged them, I see a promising future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibility, and every single day of SOL girls remind me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the existence: "Head, resist Gaddan.
But you never become a revolutionary state revolution."
They've spent almost two years since the weak revolution inspired by the spate of massive movements in the Tunisian revolution like Egypt.
A force with a lot of other British citizens, inside and outside the country to call a day of rage and start a revolution against Gaddanic terrorist.
And we did it. It was a great revolution.
Women and young books were in the forefront to demand the fall of the regime, carrying freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a value that will be exploring the brutal dictator of Gaddanic.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Extreme East, to the west.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses of about 50 thousand dead, we managed to liberate our country and defeat the land.
However, Gaddafi left a heavy charge, a legacy of trial, corruption and alternative seeds.
For four decades, the gold regime of Gaddafi, destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of Liberia society.
And aware of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved a lot of other women, rebuild the civilian civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and just towards democracy and national reconciliation.
They were about 200 organizations in Benezie and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Triberalo.
After a 33 year-old period, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the World Media platform for peace, a movement of women, leaders, of very diverse orientation, to advocate by the socioeconomic autonomy of the woman and our property for the construction of democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the pre-focus period, an environment that was getting more and more polarized than the Egyptian policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a 17-minute of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, the exhilaration of elections and revolution, as a whole, was disappearing, every day we found the news news news.
One day we wake up with the news of protecting ancient mosques and sweat.
Another day he came up with the news of the U.S. ambassador, and the seizure of the consultant.
Another day we wake up with the news of the officers of the military office.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and their continued rapes of human rights of prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, formed by a revolutionary mindset, is more polarized, and it has been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intolerance, the exclusion and the venom became the cones of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to inspire them with our story of the success of "cathedral "light" and the election.
So I'm here today to convince you that we, as a nation, we chose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't miss well.
Because elections didn't make peace, stability and security to Libya.
The lension of the crying and the alternative between candidates, and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, they didn't do it.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polarized and mastered with selfish policy and exclusion, both men like for women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but female values of compassion, mercy and inclusion even.
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the election, which only reinforced polarization and divide.
Our nation needs the qualitative enactment of the more than need the numerical and quantitative enactment of it.
We need to stop acting like outrage, and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only honor but also put the memory in practice instead of the convenience, the collaboration instead of competition, including exclusion.
These are the ideals that Libya, destroyed by war, needs desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that deals with the interrelationship and the alternative between female perspectives.
That's the real cross-success.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it exponentially.
According to a verse from the Koran "Salmon -- partner -- "It's the word of the meritocratic god -- "shell," compassionate.
The word "Raining," which is known in all the Abrahamic traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word "Raman -- shaking the feminine, and material -- that embraces all the humanity that men and women -- that all the tribes and all the peoples have been eating.
And so just like the uterus completely covers the embryo, which grows inside, the divine matrix of the nutrient compassion all the existence.
So we say, "My merchandish is grabbing everything."
This is how we say, "My mercy is preventing about my wall."
That all of them are given by the meritography of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an amazing question, which has an equally disturbing answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody is always -- why is she left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who was sticking?
I'm not a psychiatrist, not a social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that I'll tell.
I was 22 years old. I just looked at Harvard College.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and an editor in Seventy magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green card Aman Express, and I had a very big secrecy.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I created my twin soul, he was standing up on my head with a pulse, stuck with potato bullet.
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a pistol in my head and threaten to kill me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of "counter love," a psychological trap, disguised with love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survival of domestic violence.
I'm a license in English University, and I have an MBA at March Business School of the White Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of Fortune 500," between John & Johnson, Leo Burnal and The Washington Post.
I take almost 20 years married with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black book and driving a minister Hondrow Oberland.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races -- all religions, all levels of remaining and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, who is a problem of women.
Exactly.
More than 85 percent of the maltrue are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships, independent and long duration, or saying in another way, in families, the last place where we would like or we would expect to find violence, which is why the domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I myself would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would sit with a man who punched him, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the U.S., the women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, boyfriends and abuses in the United States.
I also was a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rainy night from January.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York City and started shaving.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been licensed from a university of the Ivan Leader and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that impressed me in that first encounter was that it was smart, and fun, and it seemed like a boy of the countryside.
I had large mothers like apple, and a thick blonde hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that I did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it mostly in a period.
We started to go out and loved everything of me, who was a list that I had gone to Harvard, who was going to be passionate to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
He believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And that's why the license in that prestigious school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any household violence relationship is to sequence and perform the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was take New York and quit my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifices for your partner, so I accepted my work and Congress and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was standing in a lot of love," who was entering my head in a physical trap, financial and psychologically prepared.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where they come into scene stations.
As soon as we move to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to know that Coke had to feel so safe.
One was in the guide of the car.
Another one was lying underneath the pillow in our bed.
And he said he needed those pulses because of the trauma that lived with small trial.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those pilots were actually a message for me, and although I had never raised my hand, my life was already seriously, every minute of every day.
The first physicist of Congo happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and still had the command.
Five days later, when the 10 runners of my neck had gone, I put my mother's girlfriend and married me.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we would live happily forever, because I loved him, and he wanted me to do a lot.
And I was very, very surprising.
It just felt really governed by the wedding and the fact that they formed a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident and never would make me damage.
It happened twice on our honey moon.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach and he lost, and he gave me so strongly on his head that I had several times against the window of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon -- was gone through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
Conform continued to give me one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only person in this situation.
One of three American women is victims of domestic violence or contact at some point in their life, and the Centers of Centers of Disease reports that every year, 15 million children are maltrue, 15 million.
So, really, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why did it go?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
In the contrary, I was a very strong woman, fell in love with a deeply attracted man -- and it was the only person in the world who could help Congo to confront his devils.
The other question that everybody else does is, why don't you just get marching?
Why didn't I go? I could get myself at any point.
To me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we, the victims -- we know something that normally ignores you -- it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a juggler.
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the murders in domestic violence cases happen after the victim has put the relationship, after the gathering, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other replacements include the permanent assembly, even after the abuse has returned to marriage, delegation of financial resources, and manipulation of the family system of family to land the victim and their kids, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not supervised with the man who beat his mother.
And we still keep asking why isn't it just going?
I was able to go, because of one last sign I was able to see my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, it would have killed me if it was allowed me.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone about the police, my neighbors to my neighbors and friends and relatives, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to stereotypes victims as spectacular headlines, self-destructive women.
The question, "Why is it still?"
For some people this is a way to say, "The guilt is its stay for standing," as if the victims we are trying to try and get into love with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published "Month Love," I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also exploding, that they learned an unshakeable lesson of what happened and they consigned their lives joyful and happy lives like employees, wives, and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like me.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of very typical domestic violence.
I became a head and loving man and we have those three children.
I have that black book, and also that minister.
What I'm not going to do is that I'll never have any more, but it's a carried pastor pointing up my head in somebody's hands of somebody who says I want.
Right now, like you're thinking, "Ah, that's fascinating." Or "Hi, what a stupid "entrencher" -- but all of this time, I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being abused.
The matrix could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy particular love to break the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my latest request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end up with household violence, just throwing light on it.
victims we need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the matrix to light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and their friends and family.
They take their vision of survivors like fantastic and lovely people, who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to invent consciously, to slow their scale and show victims a safe path.
Together, we can convert our beds and our tables and our families in safe and peaceful parts that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed like this.  Unfortunately, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first chip shift on a TED stage, so you have a lot of luck to paint, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when I showed up, they don't have to tell them now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These males are very uncomfortable -- less than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so they don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also superstrings.
I totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a girlfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer, he was telling me that I would orchestrate the back and make the hair out of the boy.
Of course, except with surgery or artificial benefit like the one that made me two days ago for work, there's very little that we could do to transform our respect, which, although superficial and unchanging has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, to me, will be hell to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a starting way.
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a horse discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of one heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this is heritage.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to admire, we also associate it to a high and beautiful shape, to the feminist and a white skin.
And that's my head, I have been able to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now shows you skeptical, and maybe there are some love lovers that say -- they are Niaraz, Tarah, Joan Smart, Li Wen.
First of all, the happy to know so much of models. It's surprising.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the screen, and in the 1767 contract models, only 27 percent, I mean, less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can I be able to be a model when it is?
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then what I really would say to each of these girls is: why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet or a non-profit cartoon surgeon, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this spectacular list, they still insisted. No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, so I said, "I know my boss.
Because I'm not charge of anything, and you could be the head of the newsroom of the American magazine or the HMA executive director or the next Steven Memisell.
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the cartoon surgery, it can be summed right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've finished your studies, and you have a curriculum and some work on your back, no longer care what you say is, if you say you want to be president of the United States, but your curator said, "Modern clothes for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all pictures are replacing.
And yes, they practice all the photos, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture that they took me, and also the first time I used a bicycle, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal domain, but it was a girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a piano party a few days before the photos for French Vowage.
Here I am with my football team and in V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not myself in those pictures.
They're creating a group of professionals, people, maleras, photographers and statistics, and all their supporters and predator and prostates, and they do this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is, Do you get free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a psychiatric driver, and he jumped up a red shape, and, of course, they stood up and stood up with a feeling agent, agents so we could keep driving.
I enjoy these privilege for me, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their appearance, no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the 14,000 teenage teenagers who were stopped and mapped, 86 percent were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there's only 177 black young and Latino men in New York, so for them, isn't a question of me?
But how many times I'm going to stop?
By researching for this talk, I learned that 53 percent of girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent at 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: What is life of a model?
And I think the answer you hope is: If you're a little thinner and you've got the most brilliant hair, you will feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like this.
We said, "It's really wonderful to travel and also incredible power to work with creative people, inventive and passionate.
And that's true, but it's just a part of what's going on, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever asked, with some more thin legs and the brighter hair, will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs and the brightest hair and the clothes more to fashion but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But most of all, it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the greatest benefits.
If there's something to get out of this talk, I hope that everybody is more comfortable when we recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was a passion that was bigger enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more precious pictures -- and I was not me who took you.
There were no artistic directors, no statistics, no chance to replicate photographs, not even a minimum care in the illumination of lighting.
In fact, most of them got them tourists.
My story starts when I find myself in New York City to give a poem, my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, "Why don't you bring you to Saturday to New York on a paradox trip and you continue to risk?
This is when we started asking the tourists to pass us to take the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately no one has ever fled with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change life this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October, and to make us reflect about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter, and I can see the life through his eyes and how it perceives and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusions all year.
Recently, on one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly it stopped in dry and pointed out a red soldier in the wrist store that I admired from small in previous visitors.
And I described what had happened at five years of foot in that same place.
I started to remember his heart beating with strength when I saw that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one with the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't doubt to come up with somebody and ask them, "Do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The borders are in the most threatened birds.
First of all, why do you have so bad pressure?
It's also associated with Disney Russian lasers as mental characters, dumb, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press, applause and classrooms, these are the attributes that associate with Kenyan Parliament. But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment,  Parachutes don't help prevent disease.
They're hardly monitoring.   They're far from extinction.  And my favorite, the bores have better presence --  There are two types of ones on this planet.
There are the New World.
So, why are you important? First of all, providing vital ecological services, literally cleaning.
These are our natural garbage reconstructions.
They wipe the rope, to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that they weren't going to be for them to spread and cause large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no borders, the carcasses take out of three to four times more time to download, and this has enormous branching branching in the disease.
The bores also have tremendous historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture.
Nebra was the symbol of the protocell and the maternity and, along with the copper -- symbolized the unit between the Alaska and the Ethiopian Egypt.
In the Hindu mythology, Jarrett was the god boat, and he risked his life to save the God Silicon of 10 Rainforests head.
In Tibetan culture, they become very important open to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury dead or wood to create them, so these vessels provide a system of natural elimination.
What's the problem with the bores?
We have eight species of bores in Kenya, which six are in extreme threatened extinctions.
The reason is that they're being sent, and the reason that they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and fauna, the structural communities use this venom against predators and as a consequence, the bores are victims of this.
In Southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bores are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years will be extinct, and the reason is because they fall out of the cattle consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like the Deconception.
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India and have taken a posture.
Since there are no borders, there have been a spread in the number of street dogs in sea vegetables, and when you have street dogs, you have a huge amount of time for radio -- the number of cases of radio has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa -- 350 administrators are going to be above the Turkey lake.
I'm not against the wind energy, but we have to work with governments because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut it in half.
These are birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrific trading of dead deaths to serve the bubble and to the factories market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're putting them translation.
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a local, low-powerful problem.
We have to work with governments on regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the borders, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are prevalent.
How can you help? You can become active -- you can make noises -- you can write a letter to your government and tell you that we have to focus on these very understood creatures -- donating their time to spread the word.
When they come out of this room, they will report them over the boats, but they talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the bores.
They're very elegant. Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinions because he watched them flying without effort, without spending energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do personally -- my life has been moved for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1970 to 1997, I was young, but I'm not yet.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Cote of Martiner, Argentina and Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every project we set up in Africa fail.
And I was performed.
I thought, at the age of 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, what we did rather than we did it.
Our first project, the one who inspired my first book, "Weight Obamas," was a project where some Italians decided to teach people from Zambia.
So we got Italian seeds south south of Zambia.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so we were paying them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't do it.  We were astounded that local, in so fragile valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that they wouldn't cultivate anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  Just in time to save the people in Zambia.
And of course, everything in Africa was really fresh.
We got these magnificent tomatoes in Italy, a tomato would grow up to this size. In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the sailboats: "Look at what easy is the agriculture."
When the tomatoes were beautiful, maturity and red, on the night in the morning, 200 hypothesis appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, we honestly honest."
And the Amazon said "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say that? You never ask."
I thought only we Italians took mistakes in Africa -- but then I saw what Americans did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the hypothesis.
You should see the waste --  You should see the waste that we assign to the people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read "Death Dead."
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've surrendered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that the money has caused it.
They just read their book.
A part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are impremended, colored missions and treat people just two things: or parachute, or are patriarchs.
The two words come from the Latin Rather Rockett Rape that means "Parocheman."
Yet, they mean two different things.
Patient, I treat any of a different culture like my sons, "I want a lot."
Participation, I treat all of a different culture like my servers were.
So the white ones in Africa are called "blue," beautiful.
That book gave me a bomber on the face." The small thing is beautiful, written by Schularken, who said all over the entire economic development -- if people don't want to be helped to be helped, leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of helpfulness is to breathe.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, "We can imagine a city that isn't neocortence?"
I decided to be 27 years old only to respond to people, and I invented a system called Facebook Company where you never start anything, you never motivate anyone, but it becomes a server of local passion, the local standard of locality who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So, what do you do? You shut down.
You never get to a community with an idea, and it sits with people in the locality.
We don't work from offices.
We assembled in a cafe. We got together in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once, instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not? But not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There is a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never attend themselves, and they will never say to them, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they've identified.
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face and you have to create a social infrastructure which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family family doctor in the company, the family family physician who sits with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, in coffee and help you find resources to transform your passion in a way of winning your life.
I started this as a test in Specia, city of Western Australia.
I was making a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this conversation that was condescending where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do that?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I walked up and listened to you.  Then the government says, "Get it up."  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter Drugs, one of the greatest corporate endeavors of history, passed the 96 years ago.
Peter Drug was a philosophy professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter Drugs: "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company economy.
Planning is the kiss of death of corporate spirit.
So now you're reconstructing Christian without knowing what people are in Christian want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer them configuration, privacy, you have to be fantastic when you help them, and then they'll be going to come to dough.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 cents.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the present of you have collapsed more this morning.
Local people. That's what you've been clapping.
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and one time to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The train as a way to sustain machinery, is not sustainable.
So what we have to consider is how we nurture nutrients, cure, educating education, transported, we communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for green revolution -- universities, forget it.
Government? Forget it.
You will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a remarkable story that in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year 1800.
And in 1860 -- this group of people came together and they speculate about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was uniquely: New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why?
They were already becoming straight.  So in 1860, they were revealing this dirty technology that would destroy New York City life.
So, what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up in the United States showed up in the United States -- a hundred ATM companies -- 100 metrics -- 2001.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few scales, scarce, factories in appropriate places.
Development, Michigan. Henry Ford Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to give them configuration.
Otherwise, you're not going to come to conversation with you.
Then, you have to give them an absolute device, dedicated service, exciting service.
And, of course, you will have to tell you the truth about thinking.
The smallest company, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things so many things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to rely on a fantastic trading mall, and you have to rely on a great financial management.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and search for money.
There isn't it.
This is not born yet.
We've investigated and looked at the 100 icons of the Carnegie world, Westerner, Edinberger, Ford -- all the new companies, Google, Jain.
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common.
Not the word "I," but the word "united us, 32 times.
He wasn't only when he started.
No one starts a company alone. No one.
So, we can create the community where we have false fertilizers, who come from an environment of small businesses sitting on coffee shops, and on their dedicated dedicated dedicated to their dedicated drugs who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who speaks about this epidemic, somebody who's going to ask you, "What does it need?
What can you do? Can you do that?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you search for money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Would you want me to search for somebody for?"
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Whoever surrounds us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
Over the past few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like retrospects, plastic and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their apartments?
How can we stand, and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understanding better our landscape?
How do we share our hope to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today?
I live in New Orleans and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul is always close to the giant robots that give shadows to lovers, bores and shells for centuries and trust in a city.
 There is a parade in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the highest amount of U.S. American properties.
I live close to this house and thought how I could convert it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was Joan, as a mother for me.
His death was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this was a profound gratitude for the living time.
I gave him clarity to significant things about my life today.
But I beg to keep this eyes in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to leave for day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old friends and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases to complete -- before I die."
So the shopkeepers could take a piece, reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept covering it.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die, I want to be a jewelry judge --  Before I die, I want to sit in the line of date change.
Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."
Before I die, I want to live outside the network."
"Before I die, I want to hug it again again."
"Before I die, I want to go to rescue of someone's rescue.
Before I die, I want to be totally myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at cars, they discovered, and they gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and supercomputers. It's about empowering reflection and contemplation and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit, and now they've been done in countries around the world, like Kastania, South Africa, Australia, Arthur and beyond.
Together, we demonstrate the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distraction.
Death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing us for death is one of those things that make us more power.
Think about clear death, our lives.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than us as individuals and as community and more media to share hopeful, fears and stories, the people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request today.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers now.
Remember is 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
It doesn't talk, but it's better than some of the best speakers than some of the best speakers.
Remigation knows what love is.
I share it unconsciously.
It's not appropriate. Don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences, and look at this. It's never lied.
When I sing the songs of our childhood, trying to bring words out of the words I can't even remember me, remind myself one thing: how little we know about minds and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Salman is 16 years old. It's tall. It's very hot.
It has the most unprecedented memory.
Yet, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my colonizer, but I remember the year that I came up with each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, standing in my arm during the first episode of the Telecommunications and the Lady Gaga birthday bed.
Doesn't it look amazing?
But most people disagree.
And, in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of society's normal society, they are often ignored and understood.
But what drives my heart and strengthen my soul was that even if that was the case, although they didn't consider them within the organism, that could only mean one thing that they were extraordinary, autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term "Austic," it's a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every single individual, it manifests differently, from there that Remen is so different to Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, you diagnose a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that faster increases in the world, there is no cause and curiosity.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
Yami lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that would be between the media.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the brands, frustration and interrogative interviewing, there was something really unique -- a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without prejudice. A human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, times when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about the individual, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change for normal.
The normal is going through the beauty that give us the differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them are wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could convey one thing to Remen and Sam and you, it would be you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have -- are a gift. Each of us has a gift in its interior, and, frankly, the pursuit of the normal is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for great, progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it should have been Africa in the Women's country.
Penn State asked me, a professor of communication, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was frightened.  Really secretly, scared of these students with their big mind, their big books and their big and their big words.
But by developing those conversations, I felt what Alice should have felt when I fell through the hole hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat up when I had those conversations with the students, they surprised me the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our greatest challenges, from energy to the environment and health care, between others, and if we don't know and understand about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not inviting us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy.
First question to answer: and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just to study the cracks, but study the trials, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the opposited.
And when they're describing their science, careful with the jargon.
This is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say "past and temporary terms, but why don't you say space and time."
Make them accessible to make them accessible to make them strong.
Otherwise, as Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromising ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways to cheat and engage with their content.
And by presenting his job, forget about the signs of ball."
You've been wondering, why are you called balls?  What do you do? Balls kill, and kill your presentation.
A film like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and our airbags.
Instead, this film of example from Venezuela Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of the trials is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower Tora.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence: legitimate, that audiences can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide charts that extend our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's described to yourself.
I think these are just some key key ones that can help us open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists, and engineers, when they have solved this equation, all the media.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of the entire English Library is "Scholarship."
Just because it sounds great.
And "Social means "done politician."
Although there was a Xerox editor of the 19th century, that defined a lot better when he said, "A supernova is the one who seeks a public burden without any matter of parties, platform or principle, and that, when you win, you get it by the use of a monumental verb verbacher mobile."
I have no idea what "there means "for "therapist."
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't until -- for example, 1713 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliament chamber.
And this was all because of the courage of a guy with the name of Francis Crossing, who was confronted to the Parliament.
He was thrown in the London Tower and he was hiding him, but he had the courage of courage to face them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London who won it.
And just a few years later, we had the first registered use of the phrase "for "breakdown like the metal.
Most people think it's linear.
It's not. It's a advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to come back to the U.S., right after independence.
So, they had to tackle the question of what to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was debated in Congress for a long time.
They presented all kinds of suggestions that they could have formed.
Some people wanted to call it "She's "The State of State Washington," and others, "Your Alton George Washington," and other Defenses of the Library of the United States Washington."
Not very attractive.
Some just wanted to call it "Read."
They thought it was really quality.
And they weren't even monitoring, they had the idea that you could be elected by a particular deadline.
And it could be serious.
Everyone is really concerned, because this debate is protein for three weeks.
I read the diary of a poor send, and he was always writing with this subject."
What caused the retrospect, and the thing was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to empower power.
They didn't want to call it King in case he was giving him to his own ideas.
So, they wanted to give them the most powerful title, more insidious and more likely to come up with.
And that title was "President."
President. They didn't invent the title. There was only a proponent that press a meeting."
It was like the president of a jury.
And it didn't have much more substantial than the term "share" or "StoryCorps."
There were exceptional presidents of small colonial and government factors, but it was really an insignificant title.
And that's why the Senate is opposed.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it "President."
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with foreign digitals."
"And who will take a serious title with a title as ridiculous and insignificance as President of America?"
And finally, after three weeks, I was not coming down.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my all-time favorite, and I was able to figure out, the Senate has never been reflected by the title of the Prestive.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate to come into action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measurement is temporary --  -- we can keep waiting for 320 years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this I want to leave you -- is that the U.S. president of America doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to devices, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of unwanted aerial vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have been given to the degree of gravity.
So it won the Senate.
They got their responsibility.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of silence, well, it was a singularity at the time.
But you know how many nations have the president now?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so forth.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because no one is going to feel humility when they tell them they are now the U.S. President now.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I would like to leave you with.
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape reality, but in fact, it really measures the words that the words that these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to four meters underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is riddled and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of pink bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but most of all, that cacophony of male and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I take a cheap line of light with this elephant elastic and I can barely distinguish the branches that hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of meters on land.
It releases my hand, and I suddenly remember a minute that I met days before I lost control and fell into a subway in that pit.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the depths of that hole risking their lives without paying and reward, and often dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it, because they are pressure of slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition at the summit of the Vancouver peace.
Among all the incredible people that I met there met an intriguing "Present The Sloweshophile, an NGO who was dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not such a degree of it.
When we finished talking to me was very bad -- honestly, I was embarrassed to ignore this otherness of our day, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I was done by the stomach, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the CEO of the Sloves and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some, even considered my second home.
But this time, I would sell the dirty tracks.
A conservative calculation says that there are over 27 million plant people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire railway of transparent slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars.
However, today you can enslave entire families by generations by 18-year-old all 18 dollars.
Surprisingly, slavery generates from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been fooled with false promise of good education and better work in order to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under threat threats and can't escape it.
Today, slavery operates in trade, goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are declared.
Starch exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bandwidth of bricks.
This strange and remarkable spectacle.
Huge at a temperature of 54 C, men, women, kids, in fact, the entire family families in a heavy back of dust -- they stack mechanically brick in their heads, until 18 at once, and they take them from adjacent furnaces to trucks which are hundreds of feet.
Through the monkey and the sandwich work in silence, doing this task, again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no parasites to eat, not to drink, and severe deflection was going to be pretty encouraging.
So penetrators were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot. He stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run into the car to clean the team and make it work with an air conditioning to revive it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a lot better than these people.
Back in the hormones I wanted to cry, but the anti-protection that was on my side was quickly grabbed and said, "Listen, don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they already had.
I had to rely on Freeze the Slowest and work inside the system for his release and trust that they would succeed.
I hope to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids running rocks for miles through miles by miles through mouths to trucks that were going underneath.
These big pills were heavier than the children who were carrying them and children kept them into their heads with homemade houses made out of sticks, strings and put on.
It's hard to witness something so overwhelmed.
How can we influence something so intuitive, but so unnaturally?
Some don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without pay, because this has been their entire life.
They have nothing to compare about.
When these villagers took their freedom, the slaves.
When you hear the word slavery we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with safety in this particular business.
In Kathnert -- women who had been previously sexually slaves.
I was driven by a series of starlight stamps that were giving this dirty basement, a flexible light.
It wasn't exactly a lower.
It was rather a restaurant.
Restaurant, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small, private, where slaves with their girls and children -- some of them just seven years -- they're forced to entertain customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark, and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sex abuse to their customers.
From the puzzle, I remember feeling a self-controlled fear and, in that instant, I barely could imagine what it should be to be stuck in that hell.
I just had a salt: the stairs where I walked in.
There were no back doors.
There were no windows enough to trap.
These people don't have a scare and because we play such a hard topic, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in restaurants, in domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans sell every year as sex slaves.
It happens everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that we often associate with the labor of slavery.
I visited Indian villages, where there were whole families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait.
The black brothers are from the parent, the blue ceilings and the red, of their children.
You mix dye on these big barrels and dip silk in the liquid to the ears, but the ink is toxic.
My smartphone told me his stories.
"We don't have liberty, they said.
"We still wait, though, can be able to come out of this house someday, and go somewhere else where our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 scaled kids in Lake Volvo, the highest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two major brothers -- some younger children, makes sense not?
Wrong. They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their traffic families, despised and forced to work in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing anything.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with was beating.
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branching branches of the trees dipped up in Lake Volvor often catch networks and children, fatty and fear, they are thrown into the water to delay the branches.
Many are playing.
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run up, and like the whole life has been treated with cruelty, creatively treated the youngest slaves beneath her seat.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they raised the last few networks, but they had been working from one one.
On cold night and wind.
And it tries to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Koff.
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter where "Free the Wilderness rehabilitated victims of slavery.
Sophia symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
By driving on a road in Ghana with property partners on Ghana the Sloves, an anti-protection partner, with his engine suddenly sped up and broke our car and turned the window.
He asked us to follow it through a dirt road to the forest.
By the end of the road, I went out of the car, and he asked the driver.
Then he pointed out this little bear and he said, "This is the road, this is the path. Let's go."
And as we started dropping, we remove the interferences that blocked the road, and after walking around an hour we found that the road was attached by the recent rain, so I put the team team on my head as we slouched in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walking, the single path ended up abruptly in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football pitch, and everybody was filled with slave workers.
Many women had kids tied up on their backs, and as they were searching for gold. They were walking in poison waters with mercury.
The mercury is used in the extraction process.
These miners are enslaved in one compound in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were packaged in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irritated eyes, because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells have to 90 meters and these people carry heavy sacks of stone that then will be transported to another area where they will kill the stone to be able to extract the gold.
First of all, the site seems to be full strong and vegetable men, but if you look closer, at the margin, we see other lucky ones and also children.
They're all victims of injury, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle ends up like this victim of T.B. and return for mercury in a few years.
This is Manual. When his father died his uncle, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, Manual inherited the debt of the uncle to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so severe that doctors said it should be amputated.
In addition to that, Manual has tuberculosis, and nevertheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream with being released and educated with help of local activists like "Art the Sloweshophile, and it's this kind of determining, the face of a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew their pictures would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give feedback of them and do everything possible to help change their lives.
I sincerely believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These pictures are not recorders. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think of these beautiful people, shared, that I've had the great honor of knowledge.
I hope these images wake up a force where you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out a fire, and that fire throwing light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do a mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom it is: we are like management consumers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'll try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
They give us the virtues of the whale and the dancing dancers that we'll see later.
But the whale is demanding a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably some initial request that well can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neuroscientists like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, and gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jane Strieber who, in his time, was a virtual dancer dancer.
Over the past few years has been very moved in treatment.
However, there are 6.3 million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable weakness, terrorists, rigid and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress for objective and ultimately the only way that we will know if there's really a cure will be when we have an objective and a curious metric metric.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's, and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological trial of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never do. Never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult voyage to the clinic. What if patients could do the test themselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as a not conventional way to try and try it, you see, in some sense at least -- we're all virtual as my friend Ian StoryCorps.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal strings.
It shows somebody healthy as we speak. We can imagine as dancers from a vocal whale because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the necessary genes, the Fortnet, for example.
And, like the ball, it requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time that I take a child learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as they vibrate themselves, and as well as Parkinson's affects levels, it also affects the vocal organs.
On the bottom row you can see an example of intergrading from the vocal strings.
We see the same symptoms.
vocal temporary, weakness and regime.
The speech becomes more quiet and shared after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with specialized clinical trials, "Well, they're both not invasive.
Neurological test is not invasive. They both use the infrastructure there.
Needless to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both precise. Well, but also the tests based on voice are not specialized in voice.
I mean, they can be a self-controlled.
They do very rapidly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're meaningful and we all know what happens.
When something takes such low cost, it appears to massive scale.
These are some incredible goals ready to deal with.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
It would not make the clinic go to the clinic for routine.
With high frequency, we could get objective data.
We could do massive massive reconfiguration for clinical trials, and for the first time, climate clicks at the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first microfinance biofuels before it's too late.
So when I'm going to give you the first step in that sense, we're launching the Vower Invention of Parkinson's.
Together to Acumen and Pakistan, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
Either one, with or without Parkinson's, can be in low price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: Then Max San Maha, taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What would you take out of these shows?
Max Litther: Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call, you have to indicate whether you have or not disease. TR: Sure.
MT: You see, some people can not pass it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important, because we're looking for the limiting fossil factors in search for real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy at this point?
MT: Much more than that.
In fact, my student Thanksgiving, I have to post it, has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, which lays the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy now.
TR: Bride and nine -- well, it's a better.
MT: Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Little audience.
MT: Thank you, Tom.
Before March, 2011, I made photographs in New York City.
We are polar creatures, gray.
We hide in darkness, in fourth without windows, and usually we avoid solar light.
We do to the thin modeling models, the perfect skin still we do the impossible, possible and criticized in the press all the time, but some of us are really artist artist with many years of expertise and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization where it was volunteer, there was Hans Vanders, was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 traveled to October.
It's a small village of fishermen in the Internet preference of almost 500,000 people, one of the first people affected by the waves.
The water level was recorded over 24 feet tall and over three square miles inside.
As you can imagine, the village was devastating.
We took bribes from channels and the bandwidth.
We cleaned up schools. We take the sludge and let the houses ready to be renewable and rehabilitation.
We took tons and tons of dead fish, anger, bear from the local factory.
We looked at it and we loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers and the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and logs of pictures and cameras and SMS cards.
They all did the same.
Bring them up and bring them to different places of people around to save them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered.
As they fled the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in an evaluation center of the people.
I helped clean the communal bathrooms of the big, giant barriers.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the vaccination center picks up the photos.
They took them up, and I had the honor that that day trusted me to wipe up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until I was going through my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some who were more than a hundred years ago, and they were still in the lab, I couldn't help think of how to fix that range and repair that score, and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night walked into Facebook, with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelmed, and positive, that I knew we had to try it.
So we started to play the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too straight, but where the water had documented the face of the girl should be fixed with a lot of precision and deliberation.
Otherwise, that girl would not have the aspect of herself and that would be as tragic as having the spoiled picture.
With the time passed, they got more photosynthesis and they needed more refugees, so I walked into Facebook, and Lincoln and five days later, 80 countries were offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 desperate people to join me.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Resuttle -- a neighboring village north of Damascus.
Once, we used our scanner in the temporary photographic libraries that had been installed, where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time they used to deliver them is a different story, depending on the defeat of the photos.
I could do an hour. I could mean a week.
I could spend months.
This kilometer had to draw practically by hand using the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures plunged into salt water, covered by bacteria, with algae even, all of them together with oil, all of them along with the step of the time continue to destroy them by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't play the picture unless it was clean, dry and had been retrofitted by his owner.
We were lucky with the limb by hand.
We have the guidance of a remarkable neighbor.
It's very easy to hurt the pictures already day.
As Wenner once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky in relation to photos.
He was starting to wipe them up, but he stopped looking at it even more.
I also had doubled.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been rebuilt, we could blow up the images in one photo and slap the full picture.
When I picked up his photographs shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues from his husband found the pictures in a grocery station between the wreckage of where she used to be his house, but his colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave of it.
He had to go inside the water as the sails sounded sound.
His little, not small kids, but his two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took him a week to find his family and knew that everyone had survived.
The day he gave her photographs his youngest son was 14.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could do it, something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that would not have been tagged by that day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there Handya hundreds of them helped us clean up by hand over 13,000 photographs -- the vast majority of them came back in their own ownership.
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us go back to 90 hundred photos totally refurbished and removed photographs.
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printers.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of somebody, or something, a relationship, somebody dear to.
These are the guardians of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take, but the first thing we would come back and look for.
Over this was the project of restoring small chunks of humanity, back to somebody else's connection.
When a picture like this becomes somebody, it's a huge difference in the person of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the retrofittors of the retrofit.
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to give something bigger, using their talent for something that is not a perfect skin models.
To finish I'd like to read this email email. I sent it up the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was playing, I couldn't help think about people and stories shown in pictures.
One particular one, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathered around a baby, met me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, myself and my newborn daughter, hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic necessities are the same, right?
Thank you.  And ...
Jack Edward inspired us staggering and curious with this picture of a bullet that goes through an exhibition of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go through a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion frames per second.
I present a new kind of photograph, the photography, a new technique so fast that it can create video video videos in motion.
And so with that, we can create cameras that you can see behind the corners, beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays.
If I take a laser pointer and I put it up and I turn it into a billionaire of two, I mean, in a number of females to create a package of photons of just a millimeter across.
And that pile of photons, that bullet will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and shoot in this bottle, how are those photons in this bottle.
What's the aspect of light in slow camera?
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this happens effectively in less than a Nanopatch is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola, not absorbing this research.  There are many things in this movie.
The pulse, our bullet goes into the bottle, with a package of photons that start to go through it, and that inside, it starts to melt.
Part of the light gets dried, goes to the table, and we started to see these foundations.
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel through the table, and because of the reflections of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several squares, that the reflections are concentrated.
Now, if you take a common bullet and you get the same distance and you see it in a slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to see that movie.
A day? A week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring film -- of a slow bullet in motion.
And how about dealing with dead nature?
You can see the waves that move off the table, the tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a pebble in a pond.
It's the way the nature painted a picture, I thought, of a female at once, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this tomato again, you will realize that, as light is adopted from the tomato -- it's not sharper.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light bounces inside its interior, and it goes back after several billions of seconds.
In the future, when this female socket is in its mobile phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographs, you know, if we take a little bit of low exposure, it enters very little light.
But we're going to be a billion times faster than the shortest display, so just entering some light.
We sent that ball, that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very smart synchronicity, we took those gigabytes of data and we stitch them together to create those feminists that I showed you.
We can take all that data in raw and processes them differently.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a pop-up future would allow him to see after the fish?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. The rebound, enter the room, is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the chamber.
Where we could extract those multiple robots of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, there's our feminist.
Behind the wall is a manipulation and we will rotate the light on the door.
After the post of our article in Nature Communications.
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And because we have a camera that works that way, our feminist, has unique skills.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it costs to distance.
By projecting a laser, you can record a picture, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we'll put them together and try and look at the multiple releases of light, and with that, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that prevent collision with what's around the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the windows open.
Or we could build the envelope of the body by fixing clouds, and the same for cartoons.
But, of course, because of tissues, and blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about photography as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
Just like Dick Edward, he himself a scientist, became a science in art, an art of purely pluralistic photos.
I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we harvest is every time not just for scientific visualization, but we can.
Create a new form of computer photography with slow camera and color code.
And look at those waves, remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few billion seconds.
But here is also something fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the lid, these are moving away from us.
waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order of the event in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
By applying the corruption of space and time, we can fix this distribution.
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change your life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can take a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, put it up to Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern
All of this is possible with a mobile.
I'm a chip in 1984 and I live in Berlin City.
So, let's go back to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protesting a change.
This is the fall of 1989, imagine if all these people together who are protesting for a change, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
Who have a mobile phone here?
Check them.
Hands up your cellphone, get them out."
Get it. An Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Most of them today have a mobile.
But today I'll talk about my mobile phone, and how life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 lines of information.
Data: Dark data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a direction.
The Department of Detail Declaration.
This directive says that every European phone company, every Internet provider across Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who's named who calls an email to who sends an email.
Who sends a text.
And if we use mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and until two years ago, in his phone company or their Internet province.
And across Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data detection.
We want the self-assembly in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests -- everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out on the streets of Berlin and said, "Liberty, not fear."
And some even said that this would be the Star 2.0.
The State was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the mobile mobile?
So I asked my phone, Delora Telechomical, who at the time was the largest phone company in Germany, who would please send me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I came back to them, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all blah, white.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're protecting my life.
So I decided to start a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Derocall Telechomic said no, we won't give you this information.
By the end, we signed an agreement.
I would play the demand and they send me the information I asked.
Meanwhile, the General Constitution failed the inequality for German law of the E.U.
So I received this ugly bone with a CD inside.
And on the CDC there was this.
Thirty thousand pounds of information lines of information.
Early I saw them and I said, "Well, it's a huge archive. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
I was a little bit skeptical -- what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to come out.
I want to make it audience.
Because I want to show people what data data means.
So, together to Zeil Olympin and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom up and get away and go back and forward.
You can see every step that I give.
And you can see how I go from Frankens in train to Colombia, and how often I call the trajectory.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other one, and you end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate to each other and what they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers -- the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin in the fall of Berlin, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the Star would have heard who participated in this protests, and if the Stanford had knew who was the leaders, this would never happen.
The Berlin wall of Berlin may never have happened.
And, consequently, not the Earth's Court.
Because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to store them forever.
But the self-confidence and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the self-discovery.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to tell their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value and it's not past of flavor.
When they go home, give them their representatives that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that you have to fight for the self-discovery in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDGlobal, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDGlobal, what happens?
My name is Massach Zayer and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, that's why I'm going to have a lot of time.
Look.
It's a pre-planned mix of Shakespeare.
Mumbai Allende.
P. C is not genetics.
It's not congestion and it can't be contradicted.
No one gave my mother's uterus, and I didn't control it because my parents were brothers, although they are.
Only by accidents, like the one that happened to me.
Now, I warned you, I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want any of the presentations.
It sits wrong by me, because at some point in life, they have wanted to be disabled.
Let's go from the ride.
Rives: Christmas Christmas are at the mall, driving in circles looking for parking parking and what do you see?
16 empty spaces for disability.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little beautiful?"
In addition, I tell you, I have 90 problems, and P, C is just one of them.
There was an outbreak of oppression, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a paleontologist, Muslim, woman, disability and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Paris Clinton, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood, and my illness had the same initials.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
Many people with cerebral palsy, don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the "anyway."
My father was "the mantra of my father was, "You can do it -- dance fish."
If my three older sisters cleaned up, I was clean.
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents were suing the school system and they were sure that I would also go out, and if we weren't swinging all the note that we all received my mother's shoes.
My father taught me to walk at five years putting my heel on his feet and just walking down.
Another tactics that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to pursue it.
The spray that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten garden was walking like a cowboy champion that has received a lot of beats.
Growing up, there were only six Arab in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family --  I think nobody realized that we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11, and politicians would think appropriate to use "I hate "Musicians as a watching camp.
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of concerns to die of starvation during the pack.
I was telling you that I had enough fat to live three months with not eating, so I would encourage the dawn of dawn as it was very easy.
I danced in Broadway.
Yeah, in Browney. It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with heels, or I can walk with heels.
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be a girl, so if my friends used chickens, I also do.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vessels on the coast of Jerusalem, I didn't go.
I spent my summer in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine every summer -- we would become Manhattan.
In the summer vacation often my father was trying to rescue me, so I was drinking hot cups on my back, immersed in the dead Sea, and I remember that the water was burned by the eyes and thinking, "It works," work."
But the miracle cure was the doctor.
I have to say it's very boring but before I did yoga it was a standard comedian who couldn't stand up "the "pursue of foot."
And now I can stand up on my head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the General Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the United States, University University of the state of Arizona, because it was entering all the crops.
It was like the mascot of the theater department.
Everyone loved me.
I did all the lessons of the least intelligent, I took the most smart note in my lectures, and also in its class.
Every time I was making a scene from the glass chart my teachers were crying.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the United States decided to make a work called Danish very slowly in Jackson.
It's a piece of girl with brain paralysis.
I was a girl with brain paralysis.
So I started screaming at the four winds, "In order to have a role.
I have brain paralysis."
At the end, fire -- finally.
Thanks to God protesting, I'm finally free."
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to Sheryl Brown.
I went to start running to the director of the theater department, crying hysterically as if somebody had killed my cat, asking them why, and she told me that because they believed I couldn't do the stunt stunt scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunt stunt stunt either, I can't get the character."
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without brain paralysis.
University was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a history of hearing actors without disability for disabled papers.
By graduation, I came home, and my first actor tour. It was a teenager on a napkin.
My dream was fulfilled.
And I knew it would be started from "but "buy "marriage friend in a sandwich.
Instead, I was there like a dark, and I didn't see more than the nuclear, and it was obvious for me that the superpower directors didn't hire fresh actresses, not white, with disability.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Woody Goldie, Rosie Barry, Ella, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedians.
So I became a humble manufacturer.
In my first tour, I took famous cartoons from New York to New Jersey, and I would never forget the face of the first cartoon that he took when he fell in the account that he was going at high speed by the New Jersey New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral paralysis.
I worked on clubs across the U.S., and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censor and window.
Some people say I'm the first monotonous of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that says women are not fun, and they're very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the Festival comedy of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the American in the media, and at the time to remind them to the directors of support that Southeast and Arab are not synthesize.
To integrate Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was kind of invited to the news news program with Keith Obama.
I walked into a graduation dance, I was arrested to a studio and sat on a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, can you give me another chair?"
She looked at me and said, "Fifth, four, three, two."
And we were live.
So I clung the desk desk to not go out from the screen in the second, and when I finished the interview, I was pale.
At the end, I had my opportunity and driven. I knew they weren't going back to me.
But not only Mr. Obama came back to me, but it was sort of a full time, and I pasted my chair.
One funny thing that I learned in direct with Keith Obama was that people on the Internet are scratched.
It's said that kids are cruel, but they never get a child and no greater girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of burqa.
I see clips online, with comments like, "Why do you say?"
"Is it shaked?"
And my favorite favorite, "Poor bureaucratic boom.
What a disease?
We really should pray for it."
A commercial suggested I could even add my disability to my curriculum, guide, comedian, paralyzed.
Disability is as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't make from Beijing, then Benki can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
The disability is -- yeah, clap, man. Come on.
The disability is the largest minority in the world, and the most superstrings in the world of entertainment.
Physicians say I wouldn't walk, but I'm standing here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, I don't think it was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My tortuous journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to walk through the red carpet planted by the divide of the Telecommunications television and the infamous Larry Arbital.
I came to act in a film with Adam Sandy and work with my pain, incredible Dave Matthews.
I was going to go across the world, "The Arabs have become crazy."
I was delighted to represent the great state of New Jersey.
And I founded "The Mission Mosques" -- an organization that was a charity to give kids a little bit of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in alive, and I gave him this talk to his memory.
"Did it fit in peace, paper."
My name is Massach Zay, and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little boy of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small town south south of Somalia.
This village is near Mogmair.
It pushes the small village to poverty and the edge of the innocence.
With nothing for him, he goes to the great city, in this case, Mogadian, the Society capital.
When it comes there, there are no opportunity, no job, no future perspectives.
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside of Mommiminium.
After maybe a year later, nothing.
One day comes up with a gentleman who offers to bring him to lunch, after supper.
He knows a group of people who give him a descender.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothing, money to send home to home, to his family.
They present to a young man.
Finally, it's home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Momannuja, under a blue sky.
That little boy of that small village with dreams of great care was the suicide terrorist, and that dynamic group of people were to the Sharone, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So, how did the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end up with him?
He was waiting.
I was expecting an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he had.
This was the first thing that came out of what we call "the "Wait of "Wait."
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the history of the markers, young urban urban young users that disappear riots in Johannesburg.
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, well-being but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the history of the wife of "wanting," the access of access to terrorism, to violence, to gangs will be the history of cities.
And in my hometown, Mommimanees, 70 percent of the young people are unemployed.
Seventy percent is not going to school.
They do practically nothing.
I went back to Mohammed last month, and I went to visit the Madison Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital stuck to balls thinking, and if I would never have left?
What if I was forced to be in that same period of waiting?"
Would it become a terrorist.
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in Mombasa that month was actually to hold a few juvenile leaders in an enterprise.
It took about 90 Somali juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a deluge of ideas about solutions to great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He went to the University of Mogadishu, graduated it.
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, he was because he was a graduate university, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations to be recruited to be recycled.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In Mommiminist, the biggest hurdle to get from point A to B is the streets.
Twenty-seven years of civil war have completely destroyed the viral system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize it.
You saw an opportunity and I took it.
It started a motorcycle company.
It started picking up the local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of engines over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the wife."
It empowers young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that they are looking for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man attending one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohammed, a flourish.
I was helping to train some of the young people in the rise of corporate initiatives and how to create a culture of corporate entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mommie has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your wedding band, you used to be plastic from the foreign border.
If you asked somebody, "When was the last time you saw fat flower flowers?"
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be: Never.
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
Started a company of paralyzement and floral design.
He created a farm in the outskirts of Momanium, and he started growing up and litigation and litigation, and he said, you could survive the climate hard of Mommiminist.
And the delivery of flowers for boards, creating gardens in the homes, and the companies of the city, and now he's working on creating the first public park of Mommies in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mommiminium.
He wants to create a space where families are, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial rose.
By the way, he doesn't cultivate pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire the young, and in that room, the Mandarin presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO to work for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He obliged them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be corporations, who could be artifacts of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They identified business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and create a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to do their ideas.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in development and post their businesses.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, to give them the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park, that's how it calls him, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
They rank kids in the street to help rent and keep the motors for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of "spirit" paralysis.
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, they become the young people in entrepreneurs and hatch and feed their innocent innovation, and they'll have more stories about flowers and parks of peace than the bushes and periods of waiting."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping with my father in the Adrian mountains, an area in the north of New York State.
It was a beautiful day.
The censort forest.
The sun was making the leaves glow as a virtue, and not being on the road that we followed, almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings to weigh that land.
We came to our camp.
I was a corporator at a river with a beautiful crystalline lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the cover was a trash, from about four square meters with heart hearts and aluminum balls and little blocked balls.
And I was announced, I was very angry and incredibly confused.
The caps that were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who thought it was going to wipe up their base?
That question followed with me, and it was simplified.
Who cleans our base?
No matter how you organize or where you put the outside," who clean our trash in Standard?
Who cleans our trash in Rio or Paris, or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York, the Slim of Health cleans our trash, at the rate of 11,000 tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that card?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his journey and interviewing people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an intriguing.
I needed to get closer to myself.
So I started working as a garbage collector.
Now I just didn't travel on the trucks. I drive.
And I operated the mechanical sketches and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as predatoring as they believe, and in the days where it's very strong one is really used to it.
It costs a lot to be used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept setting up the weight of their body tons of garbage every week.
There is also dangerous.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- the collection of waste is one of the top ten dangerous occupation, and I learned why.
You're going out and entering the traffic all day and pass around you.
You just want to stand, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck, and they provide terrible damage.
I also learned about the implant of garbage.
When you leave the container and you see a city from the back of the truck, you can understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think toughness readers are the most important workforce on the streets of town, for three reasons.
These are the first protection of public health.
If you don't get rid of waste effectively and effective every day, this starts to wake up from your content and its inherent dangers are threatened in very real ways.
diseases that we had controlled for decades, and centuries come back and start to give us back.
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have space for the new thing that engines in the economy begin to fail when it is in danger the consumption of it.
I'm not advocating with capitalism, just the point of relationships.
And then there's what I call our average average daily speed.
I mean just at the speed that we used to move into the contemporary time.
We usually don't care about it, we don't go back, clean, or take us with our coffee cup -- our bag of the sentences, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them up, we forget about them, because we know that there's a force force on the other side of it.
So today I want to suggest a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and influence them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His job, I think, is almost literary.
They're on the street every day, in a rhythmic way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to wait.
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own waste, our defeats, and that flow will always remain in one way or another.
A day after September 11th, 2001, I listened to the group of a restraint collection truck on the street, grabbed my little boy and lowered the stairs running away, and there was a man doing his journey of paper as all the films.
And I tried to thank it to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just nodded it, and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be fine."
Shortly after that, I started investigating the resonance collection, and I came back to see that man.
It's called Paulo, we worked together and we did good friends.
I want to believe that Pauling was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for rethinking the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and consider all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
Musical waste, what we think when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic state.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see somebody whose job is to clean the garbage of you, take a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to tell you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life by building part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Abe.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, and my team and I, about what we had to design about.
Early on, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out."
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings, there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to restore.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to be employing a lot of energy because the revealing with crystals generates heat inside the interior, so it's necessary a lot of configuration.
In a city where this shouldn't happen, because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees for the entire year.
And third, his appearance has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a prison to treat such a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really captivated with the ancient market, which is this open-air structure where thousands of people go and buy things every day to little stores.
There is also that idea of using public space to create external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design -- not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by inserting the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth of town, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, don't exist.
And they're also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the entries of the building.
And this spreads with an inflated attack that creates a free space in the building that is putting itself into the building that is putting itself in its own form, and the rain and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would respond to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a punch carpenter with profits to allow the input of the air, and also from light, but in a fertilized way.
Then we inspired ourselves into these beautiful buttons of the ethnic stations.
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the face.
We're building that with these little predatory pieces, which are the windows that let the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is filled with these little color crystals that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- not what we can."
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the commercial center because ultimately there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was a lot more economic not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer needed to have an air conditioning.
So we got some savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy of energy for the building in a city where electricity cuts almost every day.
So we got a big advantage in the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these bumps on the roof that are set up water for the salt-outside water.
You wait for the beginning of the next year, because we're going for the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia City.
And to make such a big project, the biggest thing that I had designed, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia but also its environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the middle, a 1,000 year-old structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first iteration of design that we did was to expand the existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these patents.
In addition to that, we selected some strategic points in relation with the idea of the doors interconnected with straight lines, and this is modifying the initial model.
And the last iteration was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project as the parking, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the media climate?
And it's Norway, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides.
So we set up a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with pathogens, and then on the low plant, we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that establish a greater density on higher levels and a smaller density in the low plant.
And also this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like engaging the community occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors can go up and socialize, and make activities like running a two miles in the morning, or jumping from one building.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture, searching for simple solutions but affordable, which improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable as all the new girls look like.
He had large amounts of hair, and a small pile of pipes, cute. It was super strong for the capital of states, very good for professional.
I ended up that year, and I was full of strains, until I swallowed my sinister plan.
I was one day after the exit of school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid myself in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was deflecting out, I walked into the classroom, I took the table of my teacher the calcium book.
And then I did.
I altered the ratings of my rivals, just a little bit.
All the way.  And I got to go back to the pub. But to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So, in a stroke, I ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them to all row row rows and myself a line of that, just to be there, since I could.
I still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught.
It's that it was all utterly obvious.
They never discovered me.
But above all, I figured out the reason why I was telling me that this little girl was so small, so small for photography.
I am haunted by the skins.
They're so mysterious and so penetrator.
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also primates, the blue birds are very protein.
We know the hairs are the number one cause of cognitives in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzes the loneliness or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the laboratory that you study the hairs in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration saying that if there was no strains, there would be no literature whatsoever.
Well, there wouldn't be Helen the infinite, no "Evergence."
There would be no clicks or "The 1,000 and a night."
There was no Shakespeare.
They would disappear the list of high school reading lists, because we would be losing "The Rudy and Further," there would be no Galapagos and "President "President." We would miss from "Mad Bowtone and "Annie K."
No strains, no Proteum. I know it's fashionable to say that Project has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost it has all of them.
This year is a hundred years old of his masterpiece, "In search of the lost time, the most successful study of sexual jealousy, and also of the ordinary competition, I think, everything we could have.  And thinking about Project, we have the permanent detail, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a medicine marker in the lapar tea.
We forget how hard that picture.
We forget how impossible it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virgin Wool said they were as hard as catastrophic trip.
I don't know what the cat trap, but we suppose it's super superpower.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the strains -- the skins and ProtonMail.
It's going to be very obvious as the skins, who are reduced to the person, their desire, to their imperatives, are a good solid basis foundation.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel.
When we feel smartphones, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
By being narrators and audience, we know exactly what details include, to clear the knife, right?
The cells make us all amateur novels, and that's something that Prospero understood understand.
All she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe now!
And it starts to tell himself that story, and since then, Prosphere says that every French love that Sander relies on his lover, add her to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that Standar and Prosthese, were notoriously heating.
You know, the Projects of Project would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so colonized to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
The hairs are protected.
It's a hungry emotion. You have to feed it.
And what are the skins like?
The hairs are nurturing of information.
The skins use the details.
The hairs like large amounts of bright hair and cute and small standard of pipes.
The hairs are nurturing the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  Prospera links well the language of the legacy of the skins.
When Sandrine is in his stick agent, he suddenly hears behind the doors and bribed to the servers of his lover, so he defines those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is disgusting, but it's not different to the interpretation of an ancient text or to look at a monument."
He says, "You are scientific research with real intellectual value."
Project is trying to demonstrate that the hairs are unstable, and they make us seem absurd, but in their mountain, they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a painful truth. In fact, to the more painful the truth.
The pain, humiliation, loss, loss: These were the pathways towards the wisdom of Project.
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, causes us to become a range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be interested in.
Is it telling us that we're going to seek cross-country women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the hairs reveal ourselves.
And there is any other emotion that makes us open in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion reveals our agriculture, our awful ambition and our rights?
Does any other emotion that taught us to look at very peculiar intensity.
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was fooled.
And Freud says there was something weird on that man, who didn't look at what his wife was doing.
Well she was innocent. Everyone knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without knowing, involved behaviors.
Do you smile too much? Or do you accidentally laugh with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the control of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novel are describing very well how the hairs get to look at intensity, but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely jealous, we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the hairs take us to make violent acts or illegal.
The cells drive us to behave in totally unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years old, I recognize it. But I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A migrant 1.1 year-old woman was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since he was sent to visible messages, awful to itself, for a year.
For one year. A year.
She was trying to instill the new girlfriend of his former girlfriend, I have to confess that when or this, they reacted to admiration.
Because, let's be realistic.
What's massive, although unfortunately, creativity. Right?
It's kind of novelish.
Like a novel of Patrick Hitler.
High is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of "French at a Treat" and "The Tale Mr. Riley," books that are dealing with how the hairs -- confuse our minds and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of the hairs -- the membrane that separate what it could be, can be punched in an instant.
Take Tom Riley, his most famous character.
Tom Riley is going to love or want what you have to take away from your self, and you get to stand out of what you've ever had, and it's under the floor. You respond to your name, take your rings, dumps your bank bills.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the Tour Riley route.
I can't give you all the world, as much as sometimes I want.
It's a pity, because we live in time times.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is envy. Right?
Shouldn't the novel show us the relation? I'm not sure.
So let's do what characters always do when they're not secure, when they are in a mystery.
Let's go to the 212 by Baker Street and ask for Sherland Holly.
When people think about Hollywood, they think about the male in Professor Martination, that criminal genius.
But I've always been preferred by the Instance Lester, the head face of Scottish Dar that needs Hollywood dense, but he bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Lester needs his help, but the resilience, and bubble with amazing in every single mystery.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The Avenue of the Six Navalcolits," once the Netherlands walked in, it goes back to Hollywood and says, "We're not smoked, Mr. Hollywood.
We're proud of you."
And he says there is no person at Stanford Dar who didn't want to shake her hand.
It's one of the times that we see Dutch Hollywood in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It looks like a geometric problem, no emotion.
You know, in a minute, Hollywood is on the opposite side.
The next minute, they're on the same side.
Suddenly, Lesbor allows you to admire that idea of being the resilience.
Could it still be so simple?
What if the hairs are really a generation of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be relative to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to remind ourselves about the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like continuity plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction.
Only the fiction.
The fiction used the demographics, invites them to the table.
And look at what the superior -- the last salt, the terrorist Tom Riley, the crazy Sander, the Microsoft Protestant Miracle.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of Apollo 11 and descends about the Sargam Sea.
Armstrong and Alexander were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest movement in peace time in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, university and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program ended, 24 men traveled to the moon.
And he walked on his surface, of which Alexander after the Arabia death after Armstrong last year, is now the oldest year.
So, why did they go?"
They didn't get a lot of business -- 38 pounds of old rock, and something that the 24 would be stressed after a new sense of the small and fragility of our common home.
Why did they? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in 1962.
John F. Kennedy Kennedy: Some ask, why the moon?
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why do you scale the highest mountain scale?
Thirty-five years ago, why flying on the Atlantic Atlantic?
Why do I play Rice versus Texas?
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're tough.
Jason Port: For the contemporaries, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was to wonder to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological trials.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they eradicated the cops and eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin Tofleogy in 1970 called "actually accelerative force."
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship with sail, but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1979, no human will have returned to the moon.
No one has been traveling faster than the Apple 10, and the joyful joy of the power of technology has evaporated to see that the problems that we imagined that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the global population appear to be introduced results.
I remember watching the Apollo 17 of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother said to me not looking at the escape tube called the Saturn V.
I knew that this would be the last moon, but I was utterly sure that I would see the colony on Mars.
So that came to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologies had been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhones, apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the automated path.
There is nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've widened and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a paraplegic explanation in Silicon Valley, who confessed that they have created less ambitious companies than those of the years in which Intel Internet, Microsoft, Apple and General.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the faults, in concrete, the incentives that risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the venture investment caused the creation of transformative ideas by funding incremental problems or even fake problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at its rightful point without worrying about the risk, they would prefer little investments, tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
CRO. They've always had trouble to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, who need massive capital and whose development is in the long term. They have never invested in developing technologies that are devoted to solve large problems, because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve large problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars requires a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems, because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and babbaries, less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil's cheaper.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in prices. They don't exist.
Now, technologies and entrepreneurs and economists agree about what politics and international treaties would incentivize the development of an alternative energy -- mostly a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are result of failure in the food supply.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect catastrophic distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like horses or systems for storing and supply of food, but there will be hunger as bad governments existed.
Finally, big problems sometimes have a solution, because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1973, but soon we discovered that there are a lot of types of cancer -- some terrible resistance to treatment, and only in the last 10 years seems to have found effective and viable treatments.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we should, but these four elements have to be present: the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: institutions must support the solution: institutions must support the solution -- and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve large problems, with those criteria.
But it's a predator model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There is no gravitational competition like in the Cold War, there's not a politician like John Kennedy who honored the hard thing and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
Usually, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We're alone in our present and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Okay, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the ideal ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become cliches of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a puzzle: there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very pervasive belief.
The second one is an objective -- we should have more trust.
And the third one is a task: We should regain trust.
I think the recommendation, the goal and the task has been interpreted.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a record, a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of the realization: why do people think that trust has disappeared?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I bow myself to think that there may be disconnected in some activities or institutions and that could have risen in others.
I'm not clear.
But I can go to the polls of opinion, and the polls of opinion are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at polls, over time, there are not many evidence of it.
I mean, people who were defined 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politics, continue to inspire the same definition.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be quite confident, judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizenship of the street is almost exactly halfway in half.
But is this enough?
So what polls are recorded is, of course, opinions of course.
What else can you record?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people are arguing when certain questions are asked.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust the teacher?
Now, if somebody asked you, "Do you trust the vents?
Do you trust the fishermen?
Do you trust the primary programmers?"
You'd probably start to ask, "What for?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to challenge trust in a difference.
We don't suppose that the level of trust that we're going to feel about a certain kind of official, work or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in every case.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give you the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that I wasn't a good driver.
I could rely on my most crazy friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think that polls are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to obey good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I will do.
I would argue to have more confidence in what is metaphorically confidence, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a part of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who testified their savings with the very closely named Mr. Mathare, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too confused.
To have more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
Trust Trust or blessed with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it says, yes, okay, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What's about making a judgment about how trustworthy.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
Are you competitive? Are you honest. Are you responsible?
And if you find a person in the middle matter, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be trustworthy.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible, we couldn't rely on them.
I have friends who are competent, and honest, but I won't trust them to take a letter to email, because they are forgotten.
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see they overestimate their own competition.
And I'm glad a lot to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends to be components and responsible but extremely disappointing.
If you look like this, I still haven't pirated me.
But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness.
Trust is the answer.
Comfort is what we have to judge.
And, of course, it's tough.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability systems for all kinds of institutions -- professionals, workers and so forth, that were easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a poster, and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper that will be the advance of it."
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and the institutional system that the accountability system that is destined to ensure trustworthiness.
What they do is to tell you the work of the people who have to make hard tasks, like the particles, demanding them to "say "the beats, as we say.
You've probably all known similar examples.
Everything else, by the target.
I think the goal should be more confident, and things would be different if we try to be trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the attitude, the things that don't do properly properly.
Third, the task.
I'll call the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct the trustworthiness.
We can do it if you're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust is, ultimately, is different because we give them other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You've got to give them enough base so they can trust you.
You've got to be trustworthy.
And that, of course, is because you can't cheat, usually, to all people, all the time.
But you also have to provide happy tests that you're trustworthy.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, it makes people common, the functions, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can give them back up without compromising explanations.
I take them and give me the money, or they change them by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they were them vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good test that you're trusted and you've got trust on what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're aiming is not really hard to decline.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is trustworthy.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been trying to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be developed.
This separation has been reducing itself, more and more and more, to such a point that is less than one millimeter, the glass of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of the computer has become accessible to everybody.
But I wonder, and if there were no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong force against the screen transfers its physical body to paintbrushes.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool they break the barriers.
But the two hand remains still outside the screen.
How to get inside and interact with digital information using all the habitats of hands?
In the division of the Census of Microsoft, along with my menus Cam Boulder, redesigning the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a transparent vision with deep cameras to detect your fingers and face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard -- to get inside the 3D space, and grab the pixels directly with the hands.
As windows and archives have a location in real space, select them is as easy as holding a book from a shelf.
You can beat the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that you have on every floating display.
Architects can rotate or rotate their machines directly with their hands.
In these examples, we enter the digital world.
What if we invest the roles and make digital information come to us?
Surely, many of us will have bought and set things over the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual test on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a mountain device in your head or transplant when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel them?
What would a future look like this?
At MIT Media with my tutor Hiroshi Isah and my collaborator, Rembrah Post, we created this only physical pixel.
This spherical magnet behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
By simplified, what we did was we analyzed gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation, mechanical reasoning and detectors.
And by programming digitally the object, we release it from the constraints of the time and space, which means that human movements can be recorded and rethink and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and at the distance and the famous image of Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as tools to understand complicated concepts like the planets move, physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's most fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly about ourselves as part of the physical world around us without we have to get rid of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a gym for two years in Huntington, China, in the '70s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to transfer to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my mother tiger said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer, like them.
After reviving the Cultural Revolution, they created emphatically that there was only a critical path towards happiness -- a safe job and a lot of regularity.
No matter whether or no.
But my dream was to be a Chinese period.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start to train them from very young to learn the concerns, so I tried everything I could to go to prison school.
Until I wrote to the headmaster of school and a radio radio program.
But no adult was given the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends backed me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was already too much bigger to train.
My dream would never be done.
I feared that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing that I could afford.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved another vocalist.
No one around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
I went to the books.
"Brings Stanford Companies "Come "Charlie."
Those who were forbidden in China, of course.
"The Good Earth is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not convenient propaganda. I understand.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's one topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation: "Honey to your father and your mother."
Honey," I said, "It's so different, and much better than obeying."
So it became my tool to come out of this controlled club and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave rise to my comparative read.
It gives a lot of perspectives.
For example, I looked out at the beginning, because this is what students in China learn.
There was never occurred to me, that China didn't have to be in the middle of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
Compassion reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are research camps like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Comparing and contrast, offers to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two degrees.
You can treat people "Brain Frankling from Walter Isabelle "January David Davids who were involved in a par, or friends with shared experiences.
For the crisis, the technologies are economic, politics and spiritual elections.
For the Buddha, they're all psychological -- lust, fear and social duty, interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
"The path of Church There Thomas The The Road The Task Allender Watt instead of losing, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized "happiness in Chinese literally means "all "forged "all "For "Facebook."
And "non-"Secret" in Chinese, literally, means "New More Mother."
The books opened me a magical door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I'm not going to feel alone or impossible again.
Having a broken dream really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered.
I've come to believe that the embodiment is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from.
To a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always putting them up.
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first request of psychotherapy.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley clinical psychology.
She was a 65-year-old woman, named Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using cowboy and a hungry pole, threw on the sofa of my office took my shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his trouble with men.
When I heard this, I felt so life.
My classmates had a paradigm as the first customer.
And I played an invasion that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't do it.
With the joke stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it was easy to move the head while we were looking at the solution.
"The trees are the new vents, and he said, Alex, and so I saw, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, you get married after you've got kids after death happens afterwards.
For vents like Alex and I had a time of dream.
But shortly after, my superpower was awarded to press Alex who would talk about his loved life.
I was resist.
I said, "Oh of course, he's getting out of the guy underneath his category, it goes up with a head here, but it's not like marrying with it."
And then my superpower said, "Not yet, but maybe it's married with the next one.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it happens."
This is what psychologists call a moment "A."
It was when I realized that the 30s are not the new 20s.
Yeah, people feel head after what was used to, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the 20 of Alex were the perfect time, and we were wasting it.
So I realized that this kind of benign negotiation was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loved life, but for the careers, the families and the future of vents everywhere.
There are 50 million Americans in America, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider nobody to come to adulthood without having before for the 20s.
Hands up if you're in your 20s, if you're in your 60s.
I want to see the inventors here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with vegetables, you love an invasion, you remove the dream a ventilation, I want to see. It's good. Amazing.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and moments "Ah, that shape your life will have happened to when you have 30 and so on.
People from over 40, don't panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that will win.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or are dating their future mate at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its 20s and reprogram for the adulterer, meaning that if there is something they want to change themselves, now is the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their 20s than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to the age of 28, and things become complicated at 35 degrees.
The 20s are the time to educate their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment when your daily and common life has an impact on the person who will become.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our 20s are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the Everglades are listening to.
The newspapers talk about changes on the timeline.
Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.
The journalists act ridiculous names, like Twitter and "circus")
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a trivial, which is really the decade that defines the adulterer.
Leonardo Berners-Lee said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give a villager into your head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your life?"
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing at all.
And then every day, smart vents, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: 'I know my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as it starts a career before the 1930s, it will be fine."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My 20s are about to finish and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better curator the day I graduated from college."
And then it starts to sound like these: "My dates during the 20s were like the chairs.
They were all running and fun, but then at some point around the 1930s, the music was gone, and they all began to sit.
I didn't want to be the only one who was going to be stuck, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was 30."
Where are the interventions here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but don't get worse, risks are very tall.
When you leave a lot of things for the 1930s, there's a huge pressure to the trend and so many of you start a career, pick up a city, pick up a mate, and have two or three children in a much shorter time period.
Many of these things are not compatible, and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and stressed to do everything in the 30s.
The average age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the child you want right now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many trains and courts look at themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talked about their 20s -- "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the Iranians are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of what it could be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma Emma.
By 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but he still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a sea.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a bride that showed more temperature than ambition.
And despite the living 20 very hard, his previous life had been even more difficult.
He cried often in our session, but then he stood up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came up his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
He had just bought a new Libra freedom, and he had spent every morning with his many contacts -- but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words "Anonymously," please call me ...
I was at the point of the history when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an automated accident?"
Who's going to take care of me if I give me?"
At that time, I was a lot of work to resist and say, "I am."
What Emma needed was not a therapy that really would worry.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex just to sit as the decisive decade of Emma was going on.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of the windshield, man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who forgot to forget about that idea of identity and get an identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that adds value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of Emma racing and no one knows the future of the work, but I know this: it capital capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that boarding company that you want to test yourself.
I'm not dropping out the exploration, and I'm describing exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration.
It's professionalism.
I told Emma to explore work and make them tell them.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are shading.
The best friends are excellent to take you to the airport, but the Investments that come together with similar minds are limited by who you meet, what you know about, how do you think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person with whom to go out almost always comes from its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called balloon friends of their friends.
Yeah, half of them have a bad job or they don't have labor.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way of this group.
Half of the work created never published, then knowing the boss of your neighbor is how to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but yes to your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a researcher, Emma will soon choose his family when he has a couple and shape his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had arrived.
Maybe you think that the 30 is better age to sit up than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But I'm going to choose the person that you live right now or now you stand up now when everyone at Facebook begin to walk towards high is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
I'll choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead to do it or kill time with whoever you choose to you.
So, what happened to Emma?
Well, we looked at that director and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That offer work gave him a reason to leave the bride that he lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special organized of events in museums.
This married with a man who elected constantly.
He loves his new career, loves his new family, and he sent me a letter that said, "Now, the spaces of emergency contact.
Emma story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with vegetables.
It's very easy to help you.
The Venezuelan is like planes that come out of the Los Angeles airport.
Just before launch, a slight line on his trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or Picasso.
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even at the age of 29, a good conversation, a good discontinual, a good TED Talk, can have enormous effects in the next few years or even in the next few generations.
Here's my defining idea to spread all the vegetables that you know.
It's as simple as I learned to say to Alex.
This is what I have the privilege of saying to vents like Emma every day: the trees are not the new 20, reflect their adult, they get identity, they use their weaker links, they choose your family.
Don't let define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very smart job in management of a job that was even more exciting: December.
I went to teach you mathematics to seven-year-old students in New York Public schools.
And like any teacher, I applied tests and testing.
I gave them tasks.
When the job came back, I calculated.
What struck me was that the CIA was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have a station of ICE strategies.
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh degrees, secure, are hard, proportions, decisions, the area of a parallel.
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time enough.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivation perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's C. but what happens if you're successful in school and in life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn very quickly and easy to learn?
So I left the classrooms, and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of challenges, and in every study, my question was, who succeeds here and why?
My research team and I went to the Milario West Point.
We tried to predict what chains would remain in military training and who would be retrofitted.
We went to the National National Comparison and we tried to predict what children would move away in the competition.
We study novel teachers working in really hard neighborhoods, asking us what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective to improve the results of the learning of their students.
We partnered with private companies, asking ourselves, what of these marketers are going to keep their point of work?
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts emerged a character as an important prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
Not good appearance, physical health, and it wasn't the IC.
It was determination.
The determination is passion and perseverance.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to their future, day after day not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon, not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in Chicago public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questions of determination and then waited around over a year to see who graduate.
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly more likely to graduate themselves, even when I packed them in every aspect that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized tests, even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point, or at the National National Company in which it care about determination. It's also in school, especially for children at risk of abandoning it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop determining in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a robust ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long term?"
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  I know what I know is that talent doesn't give you deterministion.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, it's commonly not related or wholly related to the measure of talent.
So far, the best idea that I've heard about developing determination in children is something called "movement "Engenium."
This is a developed idea at Stanford University, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, so it can change with the endeavor.
Dr. Down has shown that when children read and learn about the brain and how they grow up in response to challenge, they are much more likely to pursue when they fail, because they don't believe that it is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop determinism.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have in front of that.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger, and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start all again with the lessons that we learn.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more determined.
Thank you.
Growing in Taiwan like the daughter of a catherland, one of my most elaborate memories is my mother showing me the beauty and shape and the figures of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I marveled by this incredible language.
But for an foreigner, it seems to be as widespread as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can throw this wall up, so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academics would understand 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read traffic signals, menus of restaurants, to understand the basic idea of the websites or newspapers.
Today, I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can even be squared.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
Person.
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was screaming in a fragile way, "But I'm getting me up." This symbol is actually originally original in the form of the call, but I like to believe that it's in the other way.
This is a tree.
Tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of door doors in the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks to create many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's for you."
As the old adage says, two are companies, three are crowd.
If a person would stretch your arms, this person is saying it was this big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is stuck.
It's a prisoner as Jonas inside the whale of the whale of the wheel.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the commands.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's an idiot.  Easy to remember, as a parasite tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two fire together, it gets very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two tree, that's burned.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, preparation.
Three together, those are destroyed.
Put the sun and the moon shining, that's the brilliance.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Stand up a table inside the door, is the perimeter of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Torture, played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, escaped, evaded.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing them.
Three women together are adulterable.
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radiologists will allow them to build 22.
The next group of eight characters will build another 22.
So with every little effort, they'll be able to learn a couple hundred characteristics, which is the same thing as an eight-year-old Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create phrase.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain mountain. It's a volume.
We know Japan is the land.
This is a sun in the order, because Japan is east in China.
So one sun along the order, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains piled one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese pregnant would destroy their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the existence has become going out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a gallery.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and underneath the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Daddy is the films that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Opera Magerman together.
The film dominated his imagination for months.
His favorite character was Gline, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magical twist.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of children's fantasy show.
However, the OECD magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took a hundred years later, with curiously another film whose prototypes, a metal boy and a furry boy rescued a girl dress as an enemy guard.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There is a huge difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the OECD magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the OECD magician.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the apples.
But I think if the Oz magician was done today, the magician would say, "Jorional, you're the Open Salvador as the professor predicted it.
You use magical shoes to defeat the army generated computers of evil breakfast.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Magellan magician is that the most heroic characters and even villages are female.
I started to notice this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection, because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had gone down.  So he slid in the room and he was amazed as a mother leg with his potatoes, and I didn't think he would understand what was going on, but inevitably, absorbing everything.
I wonder what it meant.
Would it be themes of value, perfectionist and legal?
Would the sensation that Luke joins an army to defeat the government?
So let's compare this to the Oxford magician.
How do Dorothy win his movie?
By making good ministers with everyone and being a leader.
It's the kind of world where I want my kids to grow OECD, OK?
Why is there so many capital power F, force in films for our kids, and so little about the road of yellow barrels?
There is a lot of literature about the impact of male violence films in girls, and they should read. It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know by experience that the Princess Leader did not provide the right framework that I would have been served to navigate the world of adults, which is mixed.  I think at the time of the first kiss.  I think at the time of the first kiss.  I think that the credit would start to appear because it's the end of the movie, correct?
My search has finished, I have a boyfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the villain and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and defend the Princess of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, although kids, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how to defend the parachute, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the patriarchy.
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our kids, as real as Hermann and Katholins, but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all the time continues to appear in classic after classical after the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who believe a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what the critic said when Valenti?
I can't believe that Pixar has done a film of a primate.
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.
Well, almost none of these films pass the Becket test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
Still hasn't been roots and already spread, but maybe we're going to start a movement.
Alisa Becker is a comic cartoonist, and in the middle of the 80s, I recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend of the evaluation of the films that you saw about.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to do: In the movie, there's more than a female character than you have lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women are talking to each other in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It happens. I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good film of quality, Argentina.
Right? Rumble of Occupy, supply -- a sense of consensus of what is a Hollywood film of quality.
Pretty much is not the Becker test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a pregnant where men and women hide during the crisis of the recipes.
We have a lot of stations of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this school, and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "You come to bed, charge?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at numbers.
In 2011, the 100 more popular films, how many of them believe that they have female prototypes?
Okay. Not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women who have chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a bigger number than this one that is going to disappoint this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had made.
This is what he said.
In the U.S., one of five women says it has been sexually assaulted in their lifetime.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
And I don't think films for children have something to do with it.
Nor I believe that music videos or portrait are closely aligned, but something wrong, and when I listen to that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sex agriculture.
Who are those guys, what are those guys doing?
What do they not do?
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the villain with violence, and then to charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and don't talk?
We're looking at that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our devices like power, and we hope that that will help, but I have to ask, throw it up to protect them if, at the same time, activate or passively -- are we educating our kids to keep their male power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly fathers.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of man.
Malthusiance definition is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that care of home and abandoned.
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite character of Star Wars knew what he respond?
Obamistic.
Obama Kennedy and Glenning.
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just brilliant dress, right?
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anybody; and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories where my child is telling me, "Go and fight and more stories where you see his job is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, help other people to improve and be better people, like the OECD magician.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I most loved was to search for sea cookies.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
There are sand covers, and it's hard to see them.
Yet, over time, I used to search for them.
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love in the past and architecture.
And I finally started studying eco-friendly, I realized that I would see with my own eyes was not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles long.
And my sea vessels had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the infrastructure.
This is a place in the Eastern delta of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, just looks brown, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and processing it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like bright rose.
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Technoratorium, lost for thousands of years.
Stealaton was the capital of the former Egypt for over 400 years in a period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
Place is located in the Fall, Egypt, and it's really important because at the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Egyptians have always known that Stanford was located somewhere close to the parties of the two kings that they built them, indicated inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge plant of rain.
This area is massive, it's about six percent per mile.
Before, the Nile fluid right next to the Titanic side, and as he changed over time, he moved into this one, and he covered the whole city.
So how do you find a sub-Saharan city in an extensive landscape?
To try to find it at random would be the equivalent to search for a needle in a pastor, with the eyes sold and using baseball bats.
So, we used NASA NGOs to make a map, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nile flowers.
But you can see more carefully, and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that you see inside the circle here, which we thought could be the location of Titanic.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing show jobs. You can see it here.
When I say show, it's like the shots of samples in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation.
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer -- we find a dense layer of cerebral objects.
This means in this possible location of Titanic, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years documenting from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is Titanic.
We also find working people, coral and cup and cat, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop.
This might seem to be not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Middle Empire rapper, these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that gives the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop that shows that what was there was a very important city.
We still don't find Technoratoria here, but we'll go back to the place in a near future to localize it.
And more importantly, we have the resources to engage young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform big discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably was written in Twitter 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the vocalts.
There is nothing like that on land.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 BC.
Make ideas happen really started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
So imagine standing outside, front to the door.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that he's made.
Now you visualize a group of obese networks on bicycles.
They are competing in a wedding array of bikes, and they go in direction to their entrance door.
I need to see this really.
They're beating strong -- they're sweating, they go off a lot.
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles, flying all over the place, the wheels that go on its side, rains of the wheels that end up in absurd places.
The lobby, the hallway, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light shining over the Galapagos Month.
It's waving them with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue fur, making them ponds on the nose.
You can smell the air cookie and pass that you're about to get into the mouth.
Go on one side and enter his living room.
In the room, and doing maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney Sprans.
It's very little clothes, dancing on his center of center, singing "Hi Bab Time."
Now follow me to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a road of yellow brick and from the oven, come to you Dorothy, the Hollywood man, the Starshaps and the Lion of Open Of Open March," shake from your hands, jumping out to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the Sys Environment Campfire."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a science journalist, waiting for me, I guess, that this was like the end of a superpower supercomputer.
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different hydrogen habits.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers.
They memorized the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorized entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize more quickly the order of a flock of children.
And I thought, "This is incredible."
These people have to be phenomenal from nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, it's a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best trained memory.
I asked him, "Do, when you realized you were a wise?"
Ed said, "I'm not a wisdom.
Actually, I have a average memory.
They all participate in this competition, they say they have normal memory.
"We have trained to make these miraculous microscopes using some ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used to memorize their speeches and the medieval academics used to memorize entire book."
And my reaction was, "Oh. How did I have not heard of this before?
We were standing outside of the room of competition, and Ed, who is a wonderful and brilliant English English and brilliant English -- although a little bit exciting, he said, "John, you're an American journalist.
You meet Britney Spraws?"
And I said, "What?" No.
"Because I would like to teach Britney Speeds how to memorize order in a living Christmas vessel.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not British Spiebs, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start with something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also researching it, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of people really interesting people.
This is a man called E.S.
He's a mental, very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a memory problem, it's impressive.
Someone incredibly tragic but it was a window that allows you to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim Peace. He was based on the role of Dusty Hoffman in the movie.
We spent a afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorizing phone woods, was centralized.
And by coming back, a number of treaties about memory written over 2,000 years ago, in the Antarctica, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of being trained memory, disciplined and cultivate was not such a strange thing as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made possible our world, but they also have changed.
They have culturally changed us, and I would say that they've changed us as well.
We have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained memory, disciplined and cultivate is this confident competition.
It's not really that single system. There are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated. I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the laboratory.
They wanted to know: Do you have brain brains in some ways, or analogy or analogy from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the rest of it?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control of control of control of control of control with them compared to.
When they put them in a MRI MRI machine, they scanned their brains as they memorized numbers, expensive and shape forms of snow, they found that in the memory championships they illuminate parts of the brain, different from others.
They used to operate, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something we could learn from this?
The force of competitive marketing is driving as an armed career where every year appears somebody with a new way to recall more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must be put a day.
This is my friend Ben Prize, three times a memory.
On his desk in front of him, there are 36 burden charges that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just mastered it.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,400 barrier diabetic digits.
In half an hour. Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these competitions, all the techniques used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call "the "sub-Saharan Conflict."
It illustrates with a paradox called Bakery Parachutt. (Baginal says, two people who remember the same word, I say to you. Remember that there's a man called Baker.
That's his sandwich.
And then I asked them, "Remember that there's a battle "bam!"
And when I go back further, and I asked them, "Do you pray?"
Remember what it was?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is "Baterino."
Same word, different capability. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't mean anything for you. No relationship.
With all the other memories that dance for his head.
But the word "Baby" knows paradox.
They use simple white hats.
They have harmony in their hands.
They smell well when they come home to work.
Probably we know some panda.
And when we hear that word for the first time, we started putting a lot of partnerships to catch them easily at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data from 2,500 years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's known as the palmon of memory."
The story goes: There was a poet called Synesthesia that assisted a banker.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before they wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring to a DJC, they hired a poet.
He stood up his poem, he received his poem of memory, and he died, and as soon as it was, the bank of the bank crashes.
You're killing them all.
But not just killed them all, but destroying the body was reconciled by themselves.
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't bury your bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
So site, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the shoulders, closed the eyes, and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every Indian.
I took the family family to bring them to where their loved ones were.
So what Symphony addressed at that moment is something that we all know about more or less intuitive, and that is that whether we're not good to remember names, or phone numbers or instructions words by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional spatial memory.
If I asked them to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Syndromes, it's very likely to be very likely to do it.
But I would bet that if I asked them to say who was sitting on the horse planted brown in their lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and empower them with the things that you want to recall -- the shorter than wasted, fast, gravity, straight and absurd is the picture, more untapped to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in Latin.
And how does it work?
Let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory in the same way that you had done it to TEDxoven if you had invited it to TEDx 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And identifying some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and invisible image to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely unstable competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you see the Gallery Month on Mister Ed.
And that would remind you that they want to introduce their friend Ed Cook.
And then you'd see Britney Spraws to remind you that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then they would enter the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the Roman speakers memorized their speeches -- not word for words, who will confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the technical term comes from the Greek "the "Web," which means "the place."
It's a district of when people thought about the orange and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase "first place, it would be like the first place in its memory hall.
I saw this was just fascinating. And I got into that.
I went to some of these memory competition, and I had the idea of writing something remarkable about this subculture of competitive membranes.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a pathologically boring event.
Seriously, it's kind of like looking at a lot of people sitting in exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody is mapping the front of it.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to get me back.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem -- or the names of an ancient school child bought in a multiplayer market.
And I discovered that this was incredibly entertaining.
I had never expected it to be.
It was entertainment, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What's really about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, cartoons, protection, insulin, assaults and inevitable waves, in the eye of the mind.
I got very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard equipment for memory competition.
It's a couple of ears and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two holes, because the distribution is the worst enemy of a memory of memory.
I ended up back to the same contest that I had covered a year earlier. I had the idea that I could find, in a kind of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this could be good for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition, something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers.
These are just tricks. Bats that work work.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the palace, or memorize bars of canaries. To benefit with a little bit of expertise about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift but it's not the case.
Great memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remembered when we pay attention.
We remember when we concentrate deeply.
The palace, these memory techniques, are just strains.
In fact, they're not even real areas.
They work because they make we work.
They force a kind of profound processing -- a complete attention that most of them don't go through there.
But reality is not shortcuts.
That's how things are meritocratic.
And if there's something I want to leave you today is what E.S. -- the announcement I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much we are willing to lose from what is already our short existence in the Blackberries or the iPhone, not paying attention to us in front of us, who walks on our side. Are we so helium that we don't even bother into processing in deep?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person you remember to remember.
Thank you.
Today, I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we're going to take a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from N, Jeremi, I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a town called Livingularity, and this was my bedroom radio.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that was going to the living room.
And there was everybody looking at the cloth. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, they would all see me, and every time I was going back into a towel, they all saw me.
And I was like this.
It was bombarding, insecure, and hated it.
He hated that car, hated that battle, hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Listen.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not division of areas, but of those visceral connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we occupy in.
And it's not surprising that we sit in that way, because according to the EPA Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice us.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what it evolves to you, "self-confidence and democracy."
And I know that they think about it and based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a disconnected that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in America, we use it to build houses.
Look at these stable, stable, solid soldiers, in front of the sea, far from the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who build. The planners and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know are going to work.
So we find buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Live Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a computer -- it has this round thing, columns red, and let them go through what the Livestronum is trying to communicate with this building -- children, property values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it was another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we used the media in digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and sharing.
So, how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two dictionaries are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the prison.
On one side is innovation -- the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new hypotheses, new solutions for current forms of life.
We drive, we drive and we drive so much that we completely get out of people.
All black of black, this stops us. You believe that we feel very good, but we're dead inside because we have no choice.
We have to go on the other side and reconnect with those appreciated symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like translators, so we started to experiment again -- we make the power back forward, over and over again, and again -- we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, we walked out of the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called Brutalism."
It has to do with the ant.
You can guess.
Small windows on scale.
Something really hard.
So we approached to the 80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We push the command again in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know and we update them.
We added together and we added pastor and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it anything.
We took Chicago armed and turned them into skyscrapers that can be market marketplaces made of glass.
The forms were gone, they won in audacity and colorful, cold.
The elders became columns.
The cones grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial hubs, we moved to the slums, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own architectural fantasies.
These fantasies could be to the meditator, to the French or Italian.
Probably with a symphony of bread sticks.
This is what happens to the post-conflict.
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we prescribe memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the Toyota.
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we started making the output again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called driver driver.
We downloaded the historical symbols." We now have new techniques of consumed design techniques, and we find new compositions.
This is academic and embarrassing, and it's super popularized -- you're totally excluded.
Normally, the public puller again in the opposite direction.
But then something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Guardian Guardian, by Frank Gehry.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Goldie said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public and public in general were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times made this miraculous construction newspaper.
The tourism in Bilbao increased by 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those buildings. Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Spirali.
Everyone wanted one, and George was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical ways, how is it possible that they become pre-private around the world?
And it happened, because the media was galvanized around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the top climbers in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had cultures and tourism culture.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium happened with other star architects.
He happened to Zahai and Liberia, and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go through the entire architecture, and the digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption of information.
Think for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
Shipping is accelerating: you can take a ship -- an airplane, can be tourists.
The technology crashes. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and ultimately, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before you knew if you had designed four years ago or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The British was not a two-year motion.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they were.
That's never going to happen, I think, because we're in the threshold of the greatest revolution in architecture from the invention of the concrete or steel or the explorer, and it's the revolution of the media.
My theory is that when the media is applied, it starts to spread faster and faster, to be in both extremes simultaneously, and it is effectively distributed the difference between innovation and symbol between us, architects, and you, the audience.
Now we can do almost instant, almost instant, emotional burden of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that was underlying it.
This is the center of a town called Pines in Pierre Island, in New York State.
It's a community of variations.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished, it was already part of the community, and because drawings looked exactly at the finished product, there was no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped to be a media building, because these are not just images of a building, it's the pictures that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes you correct with the collective memory, and when you charge these symbols.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media not only have changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those libraries of LinkedIn.
If that building was built today, first we would go online to search for new libraries."
We would be bombarded with examples of experimentation.
That's mentalities.
Mendators that can lead to the mayor of Linkarad, to people in Livinggun, and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experimentation.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use grandmother and complicated words, and one is no longer a hapless audience that doesn't accept something that has not seen before.
Architects can listen to you, and you don't let you intimate by architecture.
That means that the opposite slope of one style to another movement is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Sevalis can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what has to be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for ways that are going to happen.
That means that the buildings extend to the whims of nature, rather than the other.
This means that a parking statue in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or for the doctor, or even you can marry there at night.
This means three architects can dream with swimming at the East River in New York, and raise half a million dollars from the community unit around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little bin of laughter, as much as the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow, or a robot who builds our buildings.
No matter how we build, what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more ecological buildings, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
Find an architect, control it, and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the smaller spaces, the local libraries where we shape our kids, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Stanford.
He just turned a year, and he started walking.
And it makes it a great way, typical of the children in a year, taking off, as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that they like to do for the time is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughed and chocolate, and it gives itself those big and sharp kisses itself.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of your friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And it made me think, when I stopped doing this?
How do we suddenly do not do with our appearance?
Because, apparently, we don't like.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google, "Am I a "helicopter?"
This is Face, it's 13 years old and lives in Denebley.
And like any teenage teenager, you just want to be loved and fit.
It's Sunday at night.
It's getting ready for next week in school.
It's a little bit scary, it's a little confused because, despite his mother tells him the whole thing that is beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Between what your mother tells you and what your friends, or your school colleagues say, you don't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of it itself, it posts it on YouTube and asks others to leave a comment -- "Am I beautiful or a happy?"
Well, so far, Faiza has received over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so disgusting, it doesn't even deserve the thought of them.
We talked about a healthy teenager, normal and current that receives these responses in one of the stages of their most emotionally vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving them to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, charge, giving me "I like "the like, shaping, sharing, practicing, publishing it, this is never finished.
We've never been so connected, in a continuous way, in a instant fashion, so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party party every night.
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are unemployed.
This environment, from being connected to our children to automate based on the number of "I like that they have and the kinds of comment that they get.
There is no division between an online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what's digitized digitally.
What's the most wacky thing in somebody's life in front of what's normal in a daily context?
And where are you looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are made from the news of girls now.
Zero models continue to dominate our panels.
The teapot technique is now a routine now.
And trends like, Antonio, Bhitty, Bible and Abbott.
For those of you who unknown, orbit means protection.
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But boys are also immune to this.
Like the superheroes of the superhero stars of sports and shelter singers.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our kids to grow healthy and be well-intentioned individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as contributions to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in class. They avoid participating in classrooms in classrooms because they don't want to attract their physical aspect of it.
One out of five are not attending classes at all, when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the startups season, if you don't think you see enough good enough, especially if you don't believe that you're delighted enough, you will get a smaller note on the average of your peers, who don't care about it of appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, United States and China.
And it gives independence of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, in order to get clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem over his body is decorating academic performance.
And it's also damaging.
The adolescents with little self-esteem perform less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more non-zero-sum diets that can lead them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because of what they make more risky decisions, like alcohol consumption and drugs, decorative diabetes, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and without protection and self-discovery.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pressing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or have no greater rates of understanding.
17th percent of women are not presented to a job interview in one day where they don't feel secure with the way they look like.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that chance?
It frees this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking itself, don't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we have to instill trust in its own body.
We have to help our teens to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many well-intentioned programs -- without realizing the situation.
So, we must make sure that the program that follows our children not only will have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are centered in six key areas. The first is the influence of family and friends and relationships.
These six aspects of crucial departure points for anyone willing to provide an education in body autonomy that works.
An education is fundamental, but facing this problem requires each of us to take the passenger's seat, and we are a better model to follow the women and girls in our own lives.
And challenging the status of the status of women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to rely with the contribution of our politicians in hairs or the size of their fish, or insisting that the determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty of beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as they look like.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility through the kind of images and comment that we publish in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time they did a mirror beat?
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to change truly our culture, so that our kids grow up to value their entire person, value the individual, diversity, the income.
We have to put people who are really marking the difference in a period.
By making a difference in the real world, let's make them look at the big screen, because we will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they believe they can never see the stock of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who has in mind?
Your wife?
He was his sister.
Your son?
Is it your saber? Your friend?
It could just be the woman who is at two seats of distance. What would it mean to her if it was released from that autonomous voice in his interior, which is encouraged by not having long legs -- more deliberate, a more flat, small stage?
What would it mean for it if we knew this and we would be able to put it back into its potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is coming up to us.
But let's teach our kids the truth.
Notice that the way you see is just one part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and why they make us feel.
We include the self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talked and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments -- so that small transistors of a year of age today become agents of safe change of self tomorrow.
Let's do it.
November 5, 1990, a gentleman named Elison Norden entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the Rabbi Kahara, the leader of the Clean Death Act.
And they initially declared it innocent. But being paid for other minor charges, in the company of others, they started planning attacks to about 12 New York City tunnels, including tennis, synagogues and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were frustrated by an FBI informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't help us.
Later, Northeast would be convicted by his involvement in that attention.
Elizabeth Nanopatch is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an Egyptian engineer with a beloved American mother, and amongst the two made all possible for me to give me a happy child.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few -- even most Muslims get to know.
I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in every religion, in every human swarm, there is always a small fraction of people who are terrified so steeply to their convictions that think we have to use all possible means for everybody to live like them.
A few months before the arrest, he sat with me and explained that in the last few weeks, he and some friends, had been going to train training in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the Carrie pole pole that, without knowing our group, was ruled by the FBI.
When I got to throw up, my father helped me hold my knee on the shoulder and explained to me how to point at the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise of all, the whole goal in flames.
My uncle turned to others and in Arabic, he said, "Bring "Abadi Abuse."
So dad, such a son.
At all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
These people later would be convicted by putting a rail with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground location of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hungry to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called it "Mama," which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had already moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood, I was not allowed to do a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable about somebody else was time to spread and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class was often victim victims.
I was preserved secret my identity to avoid being the white, but it was going to be the new of the class, quiet and regular, it was enough.
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say it badly. To grow under fancy, it wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was trained to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race, or their religion.
So, how could I open your eyes?
One of the first experiences that tried to test my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a pre-private program where I participated in National National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of youthful violence, like I had been a marriage victim, almost my whole life, was something that was a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different backgrounds.
One day, towards the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish.
I took several days to go out into the light this detail and realized that there was no anxiety between the two.
I never had a Jewish friend and I was frankly feeling very proud of being able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was unfamiliar.
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush Gardens, a different park park.
I met with people of all kinds of beliefs and culture. That experience was fundamental in development of my character.
The whole life had taught me that homosexuality was a sin and, by extension, all the homosexuals were bad influence.
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with homosexual actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most polite and less critical ones that I had seen in life.
Growing out of a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards suffering from others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is like to be gay, but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the "Give Show David."
Every night, Jon Stewart made me become intellectually honest about my intakerstries, and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my website at a time when I was desperately needed it.
Sometimes the inspiration can come from unexpected, and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, extremist, was not in vain.
And one day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who's suffered enough with intriguing doctors, and he said, "I'm tired of hate.
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is Jack Ebraham.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So, why did I decide to go out and get into a potential risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to bring to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way -- that although I was given to this violent ideology.
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and its loved ones, by the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
Through the victims of terrorism to speak, against those meaningless acts, as I reject my father's actions.
With this simple expose to me here as evidence that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that's projected in your minds.
It's an incredible multi-touch movie.
It's in 3D, and it has sweat sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a shore, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that projects your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is sentient.
We all have an internal film, T, you and you.
There is nothing we know more directly.
So, I know I have a conscience.
I don't have certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't consciously, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal films for?
Why are we not just robots that processes what we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the internal movie?
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is goal.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost every century, I predict that vision.
Psychology studied objectively behavior -- neuroscience was studying the brain objectively -- but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then, 20 years ago, everything started to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pennsylvania said, "Now it's time for science to tackle consciousness."
And since then, there was a real bang, a flourishing of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in recent years was the search for correlation, correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kansas presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces, or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of correlations.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain it by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain about consciousness -- the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscientists.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, not to deal with the true central mystery of this matter? Why all physical processes in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it an underlying movie?
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give them a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like explorators, like hormones, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical developments are all of the cases of emerging behaviors -- how we operate the explorers, how hurricanes work, how they reproduce themselves, they adapt and metabolize living organisms, all questions about objective work.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon, how we walk, how we speak, how we do chess -- all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is that all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the emergency, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a heart scientist.
I want a scientific theory of the self-assembly that works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms, which would work.
But at the end, I concluded the conclusion that it didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we're stuck at this point.
We have a wonderful explanation chain, great. We used this thing -- physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of analogy, something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know yet.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first, before we can deal with awareness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain. And so you study everything that needs to explain.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of perfectly reductionist awareness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me, and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Physics sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental bricks, space, time and dough.
They put fundamental laws that govern them, like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explained in terms of anything else.
On the contrary, they become fundamental, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is launched.
In the 19th century, Mahatma found out that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, masses, New York Then I put the basic laws of the electrode, and the electrical burden as a fundamental concept that those laws govern government.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, timing, mass, load -- so you have to clear the list.
The most natural thing would be to postulate awareness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to manipulate it scientifically.
So what we need to do is to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the mass, mass, physical processes.
Physics sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we could stretch them on a remain.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can punish them on a shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called paralyzement: "Dan for everyone, psychiatrist per mind, every system is aware -- not only humans, the dogs, the mouses, the mouses, the flies, the fly, even the microbes of Rob Kangberg, the elementary particles.
They even have some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or think.
Not that a photon can be full of angiogenesis when he thinks "Ah, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow and smell the roses."
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some cruel feeling of sensing, subjective sense, some primitive, primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How did anyone think about something so crazy?
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems legal, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more than a continuum with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that maybe the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to the thought with physical process, is linked with information with information.
Whenever there's a process of information, there's awareness.
Process of complex impact, like in a human being, complex awareness.
Information processing simple, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientists -- Billie Tono, took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called philip, which measures the degree of information embedded into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of paper, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of information integration, just like a fairly significant degree of consciousness gradually important.
But when you get to the laboratories, microbes, particles -- the degree of Philip said.
Information level is lower, but it's not zero either.
In Tony theory, there's still going to be a level of direct awareness.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness, high degree of grass, high level of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that paralyzemen can help us integrate awareness to physical world.
physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the equations?"
From the panicky view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find out the physical world as a kind of addict.
It's right there at the center.
This vision I think, packaging package, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical ethical, pretty serious ethical consequences.
Some can be illegal.
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a vegetable.
If you're a package and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hunger.
I think by thinking, this tends to transform your views, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences, it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samaritan in the movie Heroe?"
Is it conscious?
According to the view of pandemic information, she has a complicated information processing procedure, and so the answer is yes, if it's compelling.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of smart computers and the ethics to shut them out.
Finally, you can ask for full collective conscience, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point we have a collective TED conscience, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the parts.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that should be serious.
So this packaging vision is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental than the second, that it is universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the road right towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally go to discovery.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I came together with my friends, I fought my sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community approached my parents, because he wanted to name me for a prize of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She really hasn't done anything.  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother's breath, and spent a lot of time looking at the "Story" "Satish Salmon and Dashonsanes "Conference."
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be remarkable at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we took the disability outside the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching at a high school school in Melcow, just after about 20 minutes at the 11 class of legal studies a boy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when's your discussion?"
And I said, "What a speech?"
Well, I had been talking about the law law for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation speech.
When people in wheelchair, they talk about inspiring things in school?"
"Good, in the classroom.
And that's when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we're not. And it's not the fault of the kid; I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our masters or our doctors.
We're not real people; we're there to inspire.
And, in fact, I'm on this stage like what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to disappoint you.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that we have lied in relation to disability.
Yeah, you've sold us the lie that disability is something Malay, Max, M.C.
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not bad, and it doesn't make it remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social communication.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or another one: "Your excuse is invaded."
Or this one: Before we go away, try."
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the child without hand drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon-neutral legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term deliberately portable, because they rank a group of people for the benefit of other groups of people.
So in this case, we rank the disability into the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these pictures is to inspire them, motivate them, so we can see them and think, "Well, very bad that it is my life, could be worse.
I could be that person.
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that have been strangers to me to express that they believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this happens to before my job had a public profile.
It was like I was happy to wake up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is cooperative.
These images, those images match people with disability in profit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not as bad for you, or to put their concerns.
And life as a person disability is actually something difficult.
We overcome some things.
But the things that we overcome is not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term "missionary people," deliberately because I subscribe to the so-called social model of disability that tells us that we are more disability because of society we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I have learned to take the best of their ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the ordinary.
They're just using their bodies getting the best of their capabilities.
So, is it really fair to encode them in the way that we do it, by sharing those pictures?
When people say to us, "You're an inspiring source as a complicated.
And I know why it happens.
It's because we've sold this lie that disability makes us exceptional.
And, honestly, don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here lobbying the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, Steve, aren't you sometimes inspired by something inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
I learned from other people with disability at all times.
However, I don't learn that I'm more fortunate than them.
I learned that this is a great idea to use some barbecue blocks to collect the things that I fall down.  I learned the naive trick of how to charge the battery of the mobile phone in the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that excepts and confers us.
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest inequality.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad addict, the reason that that's lie, because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a screen of stairs has never done that it becomes a ramp.
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a libertarian and throwing a positive outlook.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching "Butterm" the Save Street" doesn't consider anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we're happy to get out of bed and recall our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the gene of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 degrees at a high school school in Melbourne is not a little surprise that their new teacher is a wheelchair of wheelchair users.
Disability doesn't make us exceptional, but questioning what you believe to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football, with empathy.
And what's the average speed of a goldmay without charge?
Unfortunately, today I only answer one of those questions, so please don't despair.
When people think about incremental reality, they think of "Minority Report" and in Tom Cross ordered the hands in the air, but it's not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the reality is going to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how do we get to augmented reality.
The first step is what I'm wearing, the Google Glass.
I'm sure many of them are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google Glass is a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll let them experience what it is to be a professional department in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run through the game camp at 160 miles -- blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels that a 350-pound man is chasing us, trying to get rid of all its selves.
I've been there and I assure you that it's nothing nice.
I bring some videos to show you what Google Glass is under the hull, and give you a sense of it.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the New Yorker practices -- because the idea of the emerging technology of emerging is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Klaws: Come on.
It's awful to be taped.
A moment. Let's take a little bit.
Ready?
Go!
Chris Klump: As you can see, it's a protection of what is being taped in the football pitch, from the perspective of the taperone.
You may have realized that people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, cortex from the University of Washington.
Marching markets." (Music 54."
Blue eight, Blue 8. Go!
Chris Klump: This is a little bit more likely to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at the NSA.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and on Twitter, "You can see from the angle of a field of field.
Or a rock?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we stop full of us, how do we bring it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called Out Ritt, which surely many of you know about.
The Occupy Rita has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not a cheap word.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep playing. No!
Oh my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain fearing his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we recorded a video of Adrian Peter crossing the line, getting rid of a table with the arm, before rounding and making an analogy? What will be the experience of a fan.
When can Masa be Moscow running down the canopy, throwing the bullet into the bottom of the network? Or Federation making a sheet in Nigerian?"
What will be their experience when it comes up from a mountain to over 100 miles like a Olympic skin?
Maybe they increase the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, R.C.
How do we achieve the augmented reality, R.
We'll get the augmented reality when the coaches, the marshmallows and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win parties?"
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So, here's a quick passage about technology at NSA.
In 1965, the Balinese Potters put a jellyfish into his field to play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NSA put radios into the hull of the markets of field and then in the defenses.
They had more sketches because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2023, imagine that you're a player going back to your group and you see his next player shown in front of you, in a plastic view that you have to put on. Don't have to worry about forgetting a player.
Or memorize strategy.
Just go out into the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate parties.
If you lose parties, you get fired as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual strategy manual.
The augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner in the stadium, having a view from the top of the people who are underneath.
You also get information from the sensors of the hull and the accelerations, something you're working on.
And all that information sends to your players.
The good teams will be able to send it out.
Bad information is going to have an information supply.
This will differentiate to the good equipment.
So, your team of I.T. will be as important as your reconfigurations, and the analysis of data will stop being just for nerds.
It will be also for dispossions. Who would have thought?
What would it be like in the field?
Imagine that they are the field of fields.
You get the bullet and you go back.
You look at an open receptor. Of all of a sudden, a flower on the left part of your bombsight is as a defense behind you, you're going to get wet. Normally, you wouldn't see it, but the RCA system gives you a love system.
Steps to the protection area.
Another flat gives you a colored receptor.
You toss the balloon, but you get thrown down.
And the bullet loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor.
It approaching you, trapping the balloon, running and analogy.
The public audience, and the fans have followed the game from every angle.
This is something to create a massive emotion on the game.
I'll make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
They want to be in the countryside.
They want to be their favorite player.
The augmented reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: Do we want this to be the only use of augmented reality.
Are we going to use it just like bread and circus, like our usual entertainment like our tool?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to promote empathy between human beings, to show somebody what it is, literally, to be in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports literatures.
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a bully how damage is their actions from the perspective of victim?
How much will this technology be worth?
How much is it going for a Commander Commandment or a Neil Derek Tasterory trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than triangles and Karachins?
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, they depend on, as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retire after 23 years of service in the High Pacific Patrincon in California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the straight south of Marine County, which includes the Goldman Gate bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known by its beautiful visions of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Goldman Gate was open in 1973.
Joseph Straughts, engineer chief to build the bridge, he said, "The bridge is essentially to test suicide.
The suicide from the bridge is not practical or prosperous."
But from their openness, more than 1,200 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has identified as such as such as such as such as all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one drop of four to five seconds, the body hit water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which are a vital organ.
Most people die.
The ones that don't, usually they are stuck in independent water, and then they drown down.
I don't think that the ones who are contemplating this method of suicide are aware of the march that they will face.
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel.
This is where most people stop to stay alive.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darker time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an official controlling his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a success that day to bring it back on the bankers.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We struggled to channel the road through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who are contemplating suicide, but officers, too.
We've run a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new offices.
This is Jason Garbara.
I met him on July 22 last year by getting a call from a possible suicide subject sitting on the heart near center.
He said, and when I arrived, I watched Jason talking to a official from the Goldman Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here twice before New Jersey to try suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason, he asked us if we knew if we knew the history of the Panama box.
By remembering Greek mythology, Z created Pandora, and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You will never open that box."
Well, one day, curiosity was more than Panama, and she opened the box.
She came up with plaguercies, sorrows and all kinds of evil against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no hope."
It stopped some instant, it was bent on the right, and it went.
This nice man in New Jersey had just taken away the life.
I talked to the parents in Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family of the family called me to see how it was.
Jason parents had asked it.
The collective damage of suicide affected many people.
I asked you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved was suicide?
What would you do?
You know what to say?
In my experience, you don't just talk about, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't argue, click, or say to the person you know how it feels because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the point of inflection that you need.
If you think somebody's suicide, you're not afraid of tackling them and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: Others in similar circumstances have thought of finishing your life, you've had these thoughts?"
To confront the person in front of it can save life and be the point of influence for them.
Other signs to look for despair, despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to get worse, imperative, believe that there is nothing you can do about it. Recent social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I received an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he was with his permission and blessed that I read it.
"Hi Khinese! Kevin, I imagine you're at TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking, I should go to my bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite unsustainable, but I notice more moments to realize that Mike doesn't go home.
Mike was driving from Petri to San Francisco to see the 14th anniversary with his father on January 19.
He never got there.
I called the Potter police and repeated it as a disappearance that night.
The next morning, two official officials came to my house, and they reported me that Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it from the bridge at 1850 in the late day before.
Thank you very much for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you.
The GGBMary, the Goldman Bridge Gates is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, "Bird."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and take the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I responded to a radio call for a possible subject in the sidewalk of the northern tower.
I drove my two-wheeler. And I looked at this man, Kevin Berry, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed immediately, and he stopped in that little tube around the tower.
For the next hour, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and desperation.
Kevin decided for his account that day going back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came back, he was happy.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did you go back and give the hope and life another opportunity?"
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You listened to me.
You let me talk and just hear."
Shortly after that incident, I received a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read you.
"Dear Brigade, nothing will erase the events of 9/11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was climbing for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly medicine.
I adapted Kevin when I was only six months, completely unaware of all those hardworking traits -- but thanks to God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We thanked God for you.
Simple in debt with you, New Berlin Berry."
And at the end, she wrote, "PI -- when I visited San Francisco General Hospital that night, you would sign like the patient.
"I was going to fix it."
Today, Kevin is a loving father and an active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that his story will inspire others.
The suicide is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing its own pain, steals the opportunity to meet him.
This is what the suicide does.
For most people, suicide people, or those who considered suicide, they wouldn't think about beating another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Typically, this is just three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suits of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other one was a man who talked about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand on three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, "Leither, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And he jumps.
Horrible, absolutely horrifying.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people who come to contact on that bridge are not sustainable.
In addition, those few who have jumped out of the bridge, and lived and you can talk about it, that one or two, most of those people have said that the second person left from the railing they realized they had committed a mistake, and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connected Mario with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us must be striving to do.
The suicide can prevent.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inside, you know what you are, and one question: How did you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had achieved the dream that I had ever had since the girl.
My foreign finally matched my inner truth, with me.
For complicated reasons, I will be referring to later when I look at this picture, I think, "Great Generation, you get it, you got it.
But the past October, I discovered that I'm just starting.
We all crave our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the courage to release themselves, to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent, my own story.
I think this enemy is called revelation.
This is mine.
They signed me as a child at birth because of the appearance of my geneticists.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always wear that shirt in your head."
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl!
I knew how to self-assemble.
The gender has always been considered an incurable fact, but now we know that, really, it's something more complex and mysterious, actually.
Because of my success, I never dared to share my story, not because I thought it will be what I'm wrong, but because of how the world is trying to liberate yourself.
Every day I'm grateful to be female.
I have mom, dad, and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There is a long tradition in Asia culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There is a Hindu goddess goddess of the ships.
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines.
I was standing in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something was hitting me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I was still wearing this woman called T.
It's the director of a brain beauty pageant.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the balloonists behavior?"
He told me that if he participated she was going to be plucked out of the belts of description and the ventilation, and that night, he won on the bathroom suit, won in a golf suit, and he was a third ending amongst over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty releases.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was the reason for beauty of transparent women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of the devices, especially when we were traveling to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly than all, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was resistant.
I said to my mother, "Mom, I'm divided.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty reader."
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you move to America you can change the name and the identity of generation?"
It was all I needed to listen.
My mom suggested me to put it to my name.
She also accompanies me when I oppose in Thailand.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to make surgery before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name Gene and the Fennor Gore Foundation."
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means they could drive or power to get a ship, but for me it was the license to live, to feel me.
Suddenly, my fears were moved.
I felt like I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, Alice Networks.
A young woman in New York who passionately lived his truth.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rate is eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November, we do a global surveillance by the Confirmer Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who fought and stood up to the infrastructure.
These are Marshall P. Johnson and Sylvia Riverside.
Today, right now, I'm leaving the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, exposing me, for some day no longer any 23-year-old stone anymore.
My deeper truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Kathine Schropenity: Gene, a quick question.
Beau Rocket: Sure. You see, first, thank you all my blessings.
My support network, my parents, my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I have attended young women who are transplanted, and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents couldn't accept it. I was going to take my mom, and he said, "Mom, you can call this woman?"
Sometimes it worked -- others. It's just gender identity, that's what we are, right?
I mean, we're all assigned by a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that assigned not block, and there should be a space that would enable people to self-confident and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
Shipping movement is increasing compared to gay movement.
There are still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter's daughter, and I'm proud of it.
"Bad started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007, and when his efforts had been deployed in 2011, when he saw the National Peace Prize of peace, he became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice, of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when the birth of a girl, his birth doesn't celebrate.
It's not good, not by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes to your mother and nobody congratulate the father.
And one mother is overwhelmed by having a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, it concerts, and with the hope of a child, when he lays his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother is, but the daughter, the newly born daughter -- when it grows, it suffers as well.
When I was five years old, when I should go to school, stay home and school admitted to his brothers.
Until age 12 years, in some ways, has a good life.
You can have fun.
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, it opens out of his house without a male shock.
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family and her family, and if you take the code.
And it's interesting that this so-called honor code, not just the life of a girl, also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, he sacrificed the joy of his life and the happiness of his sisters on behalf of the honor.
And there's a norm more than patriarchal societies called obesity.
It's supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very subtle.
It's the critic.
The model of a good girl must be quiet.
It's supposed to be quiet and accepts the decisions of her father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly -- even if you don't want to.
If you marry a man who doesn't like or if you marry it with an old man, you have to accept it, because it doesn't want to be a lot of disconnect.
You have to accept it.
Otherwise, call it disconnected.
And what happens at the end?"
In words of a poetry, "The house, the course, and then it gives birth to more child."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, instill the same lesson of obesity to his daughter and the same request of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues.
Dead brothers and sisters, when I was born Malawa, and for the first time, believe me, I didn't like the New New Nations, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely honored.
And a lot before I was born, I thought about his name, and he was fascinated with a Freedom of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malawi, and he called my daughter's daughter.
But when I looked at me, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, "Man.
And when she grew up, when she was growing up, I admitted it in my school.
You wonder, why should I mention the adoption of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to mention it.
You can give it for granted in Canada sitting in Canada in many countries, developed countries, but in poorer countries in patriarchal societies in the tribal societies -- it's a great event for life's life.
In a school, it means the recognition of his identity and his name.
An admissions to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks ago, when I was looking at the Canadian search form, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the slopes of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters in any document.
That's the reason I value my daughter.
My father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and joy of my daughter.
I encouraged them to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The animal to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to instill you in your personality.
And this was not just for her, just for Malaysia.
I've been impacting all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for empowerment.
I taught my daughters, teaching students, forget the lesson of obesity.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called healthy call.
Dead brothers and sisters, we were fighting for more rights for women, and we struggled to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and particularly for women's rights.
It's called talking.
That means a complete denial of involvement in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use the veil, and they stopped going to the markets.
Musicians were silent, flogged girls and singing singers.
They were men, but few they talked about, and it was scary to have around those people who kill and relax when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
When I was 10 years old, Malaysia.
He wrote a daily for the BBC blog, offered herself for the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It spreads like a climate around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban was unable to tolerate his campaign and nine percent of October in 2012 and shot it up in his head.
It was a protective day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
While my daughter, I was debating between life and death, whispering to my wife to my wife, "Would I blame myself through what happened to my daughter, your daughter?"
And I fiercely said, "Please, don't blame you.
They defend the fair cause.
You put your life in play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired in you and joined you.
They both were on the right way, and God will protect them."
These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't ask again again.
When Mali was in the hospital and had severe headaches and strong headaches, because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that spread on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained about.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, the entrepreneur in my face.
I'll get right. Please don't worry.
It was a consumption for us, and it consumes us.
Dead brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist at the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women -- it's like any 16 year-old girl.
He cried when he doesn't finish his job.
She fights with his brothers and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my tutor that made so audacious to Malawa so valuable, expression and embodime?"
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operated from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined myself into the Monology group of Google, where I've had a divided to my office, the visualization of Google X, but all the work that I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Now, having said this, there is a stigma, when you commit to an operation of brain.
Are you still just like smart or not?
Of course, you're going to be smart back?
After the neuroscientist, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormone and neurotransmitters.
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much it takes, from over a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have to decide about combinations and mix mixed with chemicals, and try to get them to follow with life.
More than once I've been saved by a little bit.
But, luckily, I have an experimental soul, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the optimal doses because there really doesn't exist a clear map that says it in detail.
I started testing with different mixes and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the dose changed dramatically my share, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case for a few months, I tried dose and typical chemical chemicals for a man of vernal, and I was shocked by seeing how my thoughts changed.
I was always funny, I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've known a number of guys in the past I've known several types of things like this, or maybe some attention to some attacker.
It turned out like an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be a protection.
In fact, I was trying to fix a problem that I had in front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dose.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go through.
So what I was trying to do. When I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to reclaim my intelligence after the illness and the operation, my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those mental pictures that I use to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want new ideas and recreating situations in it.
These kinds of thoughts is not new.
Philosophers like Humberto, Descartes and Hobbes, see things in a similar way.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are now those who are questioning this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works. For me, it's simple: for most of us, mental imagery is fundamental for creative and inventive thinking.
So after several years, I managed to find the right point and I have lots of great mental models, and really lived mentally and well structured menus.
Now, I'm working on how to take right these mental images, from my mind to the screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use his imagination only to steer the world that has the front of the world?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're fairly close to reach this with two recent experiments done by two groups that are laid in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain; you can see the brain scan done by George Gans and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanner of a person who looks at a picture.
The middle of the medium shows the scan of the brain of that same individual, as he imagined seeing that same picture.
The column on the right is created by restoring the contents of the central column on the left, and you see that the difference is almost none.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and figuring out to see that same image is almost none.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is from Jack Gallery laboratory in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into recyclable visual fields.
Put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were scanning their brains to create a great deal of reactions from the brain to video sequence.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while they recorded a new scan.
The computer, using just the brain information of the scanner decided to show what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right, you can see the definitions of the computer, and on the left, the video that showed you.
This leaves us bankers.
We're pretty close to do it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture, and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same map.
This was conducted with the brain scanning systems of the largest resolution of available resolution today, and his resolution was increasing like a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open up the skull and bring electrodes in.
I don't offer myself for that.
Many of them are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me. With the recent result of the MRI -- first we have to ask the following thing, this technology will be the end of the road?
Conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets, but to this point, larger magnets only offer small improvements in resolution -- not increase by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets, let's make better magnets.
We can create more complex structures with slightly different guidelines like making a spirit.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
However, most recent advances in revolution of resourceful, brilliant solutions in coding and deconsion, in translations and FM radio frequencies in the MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, we use the magnetic patterns that are attached to radio FMI frequencies attached to ultraviolet radio.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the FM radio ratios patterns we can increase in a massive form of information that can be extracted in a single stage.
Moreover, we can then divide our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using the IRCC, we should be able to measure not only the fluid of oxygen blood, but the hormones and neurotransmitters that I mention and maybe even direct neural activity that I mentioned. This is sleep.
We're going to be able to move our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the thinking?
What would we be able to do?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is huge.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease.
We have a few options more than open this door.
Anyway, take a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about stepping out of the closet, not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have armed.
Your closet, maybe you say to some person for the first time you love it or tell somebody who's pregnant, or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other conversation that you've gone through in life.
The whole thing is a difficult conversation, and even though our subjects can vary tremendously -- the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side Walter Catherine, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through a number of phases of the intensity of the little little little little little little little little little little little little little bit of liquid military -- I would not take my armpits to quote my armpits to quote the lyrics from Ani di France as
And I'm going to be a slope that by the hot of my shorts, and I had shaved my head a little bit, I would usually ask a small child, "Hey, are you a kid or a girl?"
And it would be an awkward silence at the table.
I would take my jaw a little closer, I would take my coffee with a drop of radio.
Father would immediately inflate the newspaper, and mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and it would be in the inside.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time I would say something.
I would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"Are you a boy or a girl?"
A family silence -- but this time was prepared and was about to enter the female issues at the table.  I had the Betty Friendship quote.
The Gloria Steinhal quote.
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" to show you.
And so I breathed down, and I lowered the eye and my back to my back a four year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at me what's not a challenge for a feminist defeat, just a little girl with a question: "Are you kids or girl?"
So I breathed back up again -- I stood up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and you see a kid clothes, but I'm a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well I'm more than the kind of girl of a comfortable paper."
And that girl was looking at me, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pigeon is purple, and he has a fish.
Can you give me a panch, please."
And that was everything. Only oh. You're a girl.
What about the panch that I had?"
It was the easiest conversation ever ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the pan and I, both of us were honest with one another.
Just like many of us, I've lived in some of us in my life, and yes, often my walls used to be an archive.
But inside, in darkness, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels like a living in a drawer.
It's like my armed is not different to your own or your own or to yours.
And surely, I'll give you 100 reasons why to come out of my closet, was harder than stepping out of it, but this is the thing: the hard thing is not relevant.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to somebody who's been sleeping on a broken bank is harder to tell him that she's been footprint?
Who can tell me that this story that counts is harder than to tell your five-year-old child that you're going to divorce?
There is no more difficult thing -- there's only the difficulty.
We need to stop ranking out what's difficult about what hard for another person to make us feel better or worse, in relation to our arms, and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in arms, and you can make them feel secure, or at least more security than offering the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are, a closet.
Thank you.  Just imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and high heels.
It was not the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old child to enter coffee.
I was frozen by the fear, curled up in a corner of my dark closet.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I spent my entire life trying not to disappoint them, and now the world turned around in purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been following for so long, but if you don't launch that grandma, I'll kill you.
One of my most memorable farmer launch was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests knew that it was gay, and by doing my peanut ladies and my black dress, I walked around the tables and I finally came to one where my parents' friends, people who knew me was years ago.
And after talking a minute, one of the women shouted, "I love Nathan Languy."
And the battle of the gay room had begun.
"Anah, once you were in the Cassini?"
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's fabulous."
"As "As "As "As an Aston antiblocation?
It's very good, and it's never talked about having a browser."
"As a "Assem," what's your favorite TV program?
Our favorite program Will and Grace and Grace.
And you know who loves us? Jack you know.
Jack is our favorite."
And then a woman, disconcerted but waiting for desperately his support, to get me know that he was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink champions."
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you've got all the heavy-duty laundry.
Sure enough, I could have been easy to tell you where they felt threatened.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were effort.
And what else can you ask somebody, but force?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how attractive you get.
That's how hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody to go out with.
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Philip girl.
Now, please look at this through gay perspective, but they understand that what it means out of any harmony is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armor. Be yourself.
That girl in coffee was not armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be generous, others must know that we also suffer as well.
Number two: Be direct. Just give it a lot of this partner.
If you know that you're gay, tell you.
If they say to their parents, maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more importantly,  Leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You never apologize for that.
And some of you can go out loud, forgive me for what you've done, but never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel disappointed, but that's something in them, not you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a armed dark.
And you may feel very lonely, but they're not.
Thank you, Buddhism. Enjoy the vehicle.
Intelligence, what is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has seen, a productive example has been the famous quote of Eden Discovery that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as if a sub can swim anywhere."
When Edison Dickensear wrote this as a critique to the pioneers of I.T. as Alan Turing as Alan Turing as Alan Turing as Alan Turing Alaska.
And so some years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take back a steps.
First of all, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race, who don't know anything about the biology of the Earth and the Earth neuroscience or intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know the reason that we're trying to save ourselves ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're an alien race that knows nothing about this, that has no concept about intelligence on Earth, they would be compelled to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some point in time, the asteroids that would unleash the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I announced a variety of themes through science through various disciplines, which were, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally equipped for development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of universal states that maximize the diversity of future possible future.
Finally, in robotic motion, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and putting them together, I asked, for several years: Is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we could extract from all these different questions?
Is there just an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to an E.U. and a half percent for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a strength, F, which acts in order to maximize the future of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping open choices, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future affordable, yes, until an impending future time, tweet.
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to get stuck.
The intelligence tries to maximize the future of action and maintaining open options.
And so in mind this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How pragmatic is it?
Do you predict the level of human intelligence?
Does artificial intelligence do?
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the astonishing apps of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or "English," throughout their life should have trends to more favorable conditions for existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that tangible cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence is a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with low entropy production, but actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called Entropic, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system in which it is inside.
Amazingly, entropy was able to spend multiple amounts of animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even earn money trading actions, all of them without having been told to do that.
Here are some examples of England in action.
Like a human foot of foot, here we see Entropic balancing automatically by using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
It just decided to balance the pole.
This skill of equilibrium will have applications for human robotics and high-tech technologies.
This ability for tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Furthermore, like some other animals can cooperate from extremes of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that entropy can perform a model of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
Entropion is widely applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it very successfully, playing a game against itself, illustrating their potential for play.
Here we see Entrophy orchestration new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly disconnected and maintains the net well-being network.
This same capacity of network of network has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see Entrepreneur to organize the routes of a barcoding float, discovery with success and using the Panama Canal to expand globally.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomy defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see England spontaneously, and running a company strategy -- selling in a simulated series of action negotiation -- hugely increasing the assets under its exponential management.
This skill management skill will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex Wiscomps: So what you've seen is that a variety of marks of smart cognitive human behaviors such as tools, walking upright, and social cooperation -- everybody derived a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony.
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term robot, the work "Ramanue," there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines there would be a cyber rebellion, there would be a cyber rebellion.
Machines would rise against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of cyber rebellion to investment.
Not that machines first become smart and then menals and they try to move out of the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking the control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for target.
They often ask me, "How do you seek goals to get rid of this kind of frame?
My equivalent to that statement to pass the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a point of influence in human history, something between the consuries of stars and losing the planet we call "the home."
Now, in the last few years, we've widened a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth looks like in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Prize of NASA has discovered thousands of planets that orbit around other stars -- which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the luminous intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that we get.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of planets that are in between them and their mother's star.
In ensemble, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, and rock planets like the planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they receive from their sun.
In turn, this gives hints about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this tool of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is falling under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hottest record.
Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia now are disappearing, in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've inflicted global scale have outperformed our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a scientist, no astronomy scientist.
I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I seek alien opportunities in the inefficient sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the planet and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor and Mars.
Mars is small and rock, and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, demonstrated this by a mission like Kevlar.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our rovers like Curitiba trace its surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit it as the MRI mission -- they take samples from the Martian atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their skills.
The private companies now offer not only short spatial flights but also the chance of living on Mars.
But despite all these marine pictures remind us to the deserts.
Let's take the extension of the disasters of our planet who still have to colonize -- really exponential places compared to Mars.
Even in the driest and more lofty places on Earth, the air is cool and extended from oxygen by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets arrested with a big and sad shadow, the implications, and the belief of some that Mars will wait there to save ourselves from this unexplored self-assembly of the only planet that we know is truly habitable Earth.
For a lot of I like intergalactic exploration, I'm deeply upset with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment to us that the party is really going to be later on the living boats.   Thank you.
But the goals for self-expression and land preservation is not contradictor.
No, they're actually faces of the same coin, the goal to understand, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like alien pandemics.
Only you find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and sustain habitable spaces, in the hostile areas and inevitations of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment -- the Fermi paradox.
A lot of years ago, Enrico Fermi asked him, considering that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become technological advanced technology to consider to continue to continue to live between stars, lose the notion of how important planets that propelled this development.
It's arrogant to think that just intergalactic colonization will save us of ourselves, but planetary preservation and intergalactic exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the skill on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I looked at my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window they were on the dining table, where I had left them.
So quickly, I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty well closed.
I thought I would call a clothes, at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a chariot could take a long time to go, and I was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I thought about my passport and the suitcase of me.
It would be expensive, but surely it was not more expensive than a half a night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, I went on to stop.
I'm a professional neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
Cortisol Liberia increases heart rhythm, modulated the levels of adrenaline and cloudy thinking.
And when I got to the roughness counter on the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in place, that prevent bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, that minimize the probability of a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't crystallize.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahner won from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that he broke the window, and he had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prototyping reservation.
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary Kleiner, who had written from this a few years ago, known as the prize.
You all know what the post-conflict is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what was wrong, right?
In the printer, as Danny explained, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could be wrong, and then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk to you is some things that we can do in the form of a printer.
Some of them are evidence, others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
In the house, fulfilling a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds with common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis -- based on how our spatial memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hypothesis, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the fish, where the fish are the fish, that encode frugal trees, where tribes live and enemy.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the textbooks in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the cars to find their nuts.
And if you wonder if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the flexible sense of the cars and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move very good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, glasses of reading and passports.
So at home, they have a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For his passport, a particular coat.
For their reading glasses, a particular message.
If you get a place and you're shared with it your things to be there when you look at it.
What about the trips?
Take a picture of his credit card cards license, lead to drive, passenger, send them by email to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or steal them, this can be easier for sustainability.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
The cortex is toxic and entropy thinking.
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress, we're not going to be at the best time, and we have to put the systems in its site.
And there's perhaps no more interesting situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved selves, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very specific medical condition.
But this is confronted as a prospect for all decision-making, and in fact for the decision of financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take from one of the rational assessment of the facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little high."
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, heart strips.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best thing, then the doctor says, "I'd like to acknowledge a drug that will help you reduce the colony, a station."
And maybe you've heard about the stations, and it knows that it's one of the most knowledgeable drugs in the world today. It's even likely to be known to people who take them.
So you think, "Yes, I remember the station."
But there's a question that should be done then, a statistic that has to be asked for most doctors don't want to talk; and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the NIH, the number is necessary to treat.
And what is this, the NASA?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you have to think what kind of statistic described is that?
Number must be one.
My doctor wouldn't get me to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the medical thing, and if it's guilty of somebody, it's scientists like me.
We didn't understand the underlying mechanisms.
But the estimates of the Clapic that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number requiring the most widely received, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help?
300.
This is based on the research of cynical researchers and Pamela Harvard, confirmed independently by Bloomburgh.
I myself explored the numbers.
300.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 to lower my cholesterol.
Why not? Doctor? Give me the recipe of all."
But then you have to ask yourself for a statistic statistics, and it's "Hello" of high school effects. Yeah?
For this particular medicine, secondary effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things: debating muscle and articulate pain, satisfying pain, but now you think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the medicine."
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you take this over time, so you don't have to fabricate the chain of reasoning in the act.
300.
You have 15 times more likely to go out through the drug that you help you help you.
I don't say they had to take the statue or not.
I just say they must have this conversation with their doctor.
The doctor ethic requires, is part of informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air because of the value of the crash, but actually this number is necessary to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that most of it is done in the top of 50, extracting from prostate cancer, the number is necessary to treat is '94.
So 49 surgeries by one person who's helped me.
And the secondary effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or excruting error, underlying income, remarkable filmmaker, fecal incontinent.
And if you're lucky and you're one of that 50 percent of the effects just lasted a year or two.
So the idea of the predator is to think before the questions you can think about that will drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to fabricate all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change you in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that a lot of systems come in.
There is an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator -- it doesn't need the digestive system, or the liberty or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very fast. They could become the lunch of lions -- so none of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window for those moments of stress is rational logic, like Danny Kahn and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to train ourselves to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all defective.
We're all going to fail occasionally.
The idea is to think about the future how those failures, to put the systems in the place that will help minimize the damage or to prevent bad things to happen in the first place.
By reconciling at night in Montreal when I came back from my trip, my contractor installed a combination of combination alongside the door, with one key door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Piameter, "Poo is my favorite musical symbol of me.
It means playing great.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a pH in the score, you need to play more smoothly.
Two percent, even more gentle.
Four. Extremely smooth supermarket.
This is my drawing from a tree tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of people can have never come to a full silence.
That's my definition of silence: a very dark sound sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the ATMs, plus a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came up during the 1930s, and over time, it was mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we know as AAPA.
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a deaf person who lives in a world of sounds, it's as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules and costs, behaviors and norms without questioning them.
So how do I understand sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my alternatives and amplify sound.
I learned and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people respond to.
So I learned, for example.
"Don't throw the door."
"Don't do a lot of noise, when you eat the bag of chips.
"Don't burn, and when you're eating it, "Make sure you can't raise the covers on the plate."
This is all called "Story" stuff."
Maybe I think of sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super superior of sound.
And I'm always waiting for nerves the sound, which is to come next.
From there, this drawing.
ADHD.
TBB, of course.
TED, for announcement.
You can see that the preservation has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle and stamp bars.
In deaf culture, the movement is equal to sound.
This is the sign for "the Asperger's presence."
A typical press has five lines.
However, to me, make it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin Germany, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painter.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries -- and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that struck me.
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to distance more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a tactile way, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and integrate it into my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in sound, I decided to leave it and unveil it.
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was amazed with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
On the bottom of my mind, I always felt like the sound was anger, was a little bit of a person.
And sound is so powerful that I could be diagnosed with myself and my artistic work, or I could empower.
I chose that I would empower.
There is a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me equally and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant to current society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with many different interpretations of Alaska.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be listening.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking her voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high rate.
If I wasn't going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could vanish myself into oblivion.
So with sound as my new artistic medium, I deepening in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and ATLS.
For example, a musical note can't capture and express the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept at ATLS.
The two are very specific and highly modeled, meaning that subtle changes can affect all the meaning of signs and sound signals.
I'd like to share you with a meteorite of the piano to understand better how the ATLS works.
So, imagine a piano.
The ASHA is divided in many different grammar parameters.
If you take a different wall for each finger as the piano is playing, like facial expression -- the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while you're touching the piano, English is a linear language, as if you just suck up just one key at a time.
However, ALS is more like an account, you need the 10 fingers in a similar form to express a clear concept or an idea at ATLS.
If only a headline would change the cord, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, bomb and volume.
At ATLS, by using these different grammar parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal filter in that."
This is the sign filter in that."
I'm looking at you.
Look at me.
Oh, I was hooked.
E: Oh.
What are you looking at?
Oh, good."
So I started thinking, and if I look at the ASHA through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of "do "stand," the sun comes out and you get it.
This is all day."
If you repeat it and reduce the speed, it looks like a musical artifact.
Every day.
I feel the same thing can say from all."
"All night.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different types of nights -- night, "For the night -- "for the night."
I feel the third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed at ATLS, and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one hero. One hand, two hands, is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So, the first example is a lot of time."
Then, pastalized."
"World time." It's a musical term with a specific rate of four times by companies.
However, when I see the word "compelling word "men" I automatically think at the same time."
Look at MD: Hand right, M, left hand.
We have the pressure through the head and the chest.
Man: MR: DM: "For "Four Common Facebook -- "The Facebook -- I'm going to show you a form of the hand called "flatting" "flattoon."
Can you do it with me?
All of you with your hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like the chest.
Yeah, great.
That means "more than the international system.
The international system, as notice, is a visual tool to help communicate in every culture and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means "controllability at the ATL.
Now, third, please. Please follow me again.
And again, again.
It's "Limberland at ALS.
We're going to do the three together.
"Well, "In "Jamaican," "colored and Ligumena."
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest, but they transmit very different meanings.
It's incredible to see how the ALS is alive and thriving, just like music.
Yet nowadays, we live in a very organic world.
And just because the ATLS has no sounds, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the ATLS to develop its own value, without sound.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that they don't have to be deaf to learn ALS.
The ATLS is a rich test and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Denner Katzzka! Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents told me, "You can put it all, but then you've got to clean it."
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful locations, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or a group of ignorance I should say, because adults lie to protect us from the awful truth.
By getting older, I learned that adults are also underlying and they're not very good to clean the others.
Time shifted, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention at the Burger school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk along the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we clean the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I didn't give it all.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's creepy.
And over the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big drawings and networks, and collecting those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those enormous boat.
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream with invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny little classroom in Hong Kong.
We started building this mess of work with assault height so that kids too low can participate.
And I'll tell you, children who manipulate electrical tools are great and safe.
Exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragmentation.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine them into something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting bits of plastic, we just collect information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this plastic -- children are excited with robots.
Then we create quickly what we call "a prototype."
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we end before lunch.
And we transform cams and web cameras, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic bits hovering slowly through the sensor while the computer in order to process this image and measure the size of every particle to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We documented this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called "Ashramons," with hope that somebody else even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and boom, they're trying to fix it immediately.
I can research my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very informed, relative.
You see the news, you see the Internet, and they came up with this picture.
A child maybe, maybe 10 years old, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands, in Sunnaches, the largest mangrove forest in the world in Bangladesh.
There were very surprising because this is the water that drink, it's the water that is based, the water where they fish, the place where they live.
You can see as well as the water is brown, the mud and oil are also a brown color, and when everything combined, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called spirit, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectrum that can fly through all kinds of substances that produce different species, which can help identify what's in the water.
We take this prototyping with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help raise other children.
I can research a problem at a distance -- I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to tackle a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that there were several giant waves, called the tsunami called the tsunami and those tsunami destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fuller, a nuclear headquarters in the water.
And today, according to reports a 300 tons are still leaking from nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution.
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure Fukushima radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it looks safe. It's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I returned to Fukushima every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course, we didn't take them, the parents weren't allowed it.
But every night we informed the center center, here you see the use of different mask.
It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with radiology their entire life.
Together with them we discussed the data collected that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the entire and so forth.
And to do this, we created a rudimentary topographic map of the region around nuclear power.
We created the rise map, we introduced pigment to represent real-time data from radioactivity, and we hammered water to simulate rain.
With this, we were able to notice that the radioactive powder leaking from the top of the mountain towards the stolen system and deflecting in the ocean.
It was a rough estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear headquarters to date.
We approached to 1.5 miles away from nuclear ceremony, and with the help of the fishermen of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a sharp of sediment as we invented and build.
Here's a progress: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the jump, and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong, and we turned it into the greatest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong, and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, optics, basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality, and where adults can be children again.
Students: Acceleration: Acceleration. </s> Ark.
Step Harriet: We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help the mobility of the advanced age of advanced age transforming its standard wheelchair chairs into new electrical vehicles.
The plastic, oil and radiology are terrible, but the worst legacy that we can leave to our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators, sources, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin domes -- two radically opposite design culture.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of one silk of silk.
One of them is synthetic, the other organism.
One is implemented on the environment, the other thing created it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel Minister said that when he looked at the marble in his office, he saw a figure that struggles for being free.
The film was only an Angeline Michelle tool.
But living creatures are not centigrade.
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we take all the information required by every cell to work and to replicate it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by risks of manufacturing manufacturing and mass production."
The polling lines have documented a world made of parts, expressing the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects as self-discoveries of discrete parts with different functions.
But you don't find any human-controlled materials in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are blessed with slides like this.
The skin skins are more thick with small stunts.
You act mostly as a filter, the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same skin, there are no parts, there are no shifts.
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through variation variability.
Here's a divided display that represents my view of the world, the double personality of every designer and architect by working on the bottom and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the self-assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right, analysis and synthesis, shows up on the two screens after me.
My job, in his simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, leaving the salesman and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why was it possible for 10 or five years ago?
We live at a very specific moment in history, a rare time, where they connect four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four camps, my team and I created.
Please, meet the minds and my students' hands.
We designed objects, products and structures and tools across scale, large scale, like this robotic arm, with a slide of 24 meters in diameter with a vertical basis that someday not very distant to print the entire buildings in terms of genetically modified microfinance.
Here's the slide, an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each openness is size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility to create a layer and a filter. This was for a fashion advocate from Paris with Ariels van Hertz. It's like a second skin made from one piece, ridiculous in the control, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and forged 3D flowering with the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 microseconds.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CAD scan.
That designers have access to this high-tech, high resolution and synthetic instruments allow us to design products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the structural, comfortable and also that absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, we came back to nature to inspire us, and by designing this pattern of supernormal surface, it becomes substantial.
We print this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in redesigning, opportunity and color, correspond to the dots of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies their functionality not through the addition of another material or another stability, but varies continually.
But is the ideal nature of nature?
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible, and one of them came up with me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the creation, God sends the Earth to grow a fruit tree loaded by fruit."
For that first fractal tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and fruit.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, land made trees grow up trees with weapons, cortex, workshops and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often wonder, "What would the design would be if the objects were made from one piece alone?
Will we go back to a better state of creativity?
So we looked for the biblical material, the kind of material of the fruit tree with fruit fruits and we found it.
The second-largest biofabrication on the planet is called the clothes, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs and wrinkles and butterflies and marriages.
We thought that if we could synthesize their properties, we could produce multicellular structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal marker --  We asked a bunch of sharps of shrimp, we hurt them and we produced the sandwich pastor.
By leveraging chemical concentration, we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and operation, to light, soft and transparent.
To print large-scale structures built a system with multiple amounts of extractive controlled extraction.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material three millimeters long, 100 percent recyclable.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural shape to contact with air.
So why do we continue to design plastic?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain photosynthetic microprocessors that first appeared.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard, and MIT, we embedded genetically designed bacteria to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition with no trouble problems to mesh, and if it broadens even more, to windows.
A frugal tree charged of fruit.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first life forms on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made from shrimp husks into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade.
The fit for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We seek the possibility to create clothes to keep life for intergalactic travel.
To do that, we should dominate bacteria and control its inflow.
So as the periodic table, we did our own table of elements: new forms of life created computerized formally engineered and embedded in biological form.
I like to think about synthetic biology like liquid alchemy -- only that instead of transparent precious metal, they synthesize new biological officials within very small channels.
This field is called metabolism.
We print our own 3D channel to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothing, they combined two microscopes.
The first is the correction.
It lives in our oceans, and in the waters of fresh water.
And the second, E. Colorid, the bacteria that dwell in the human intestine.
One converts the light in sugar, the other sugar consumes and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never meet.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To connect these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help them flow these bacteria and to alter their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, preserving the properties of the material according to desirable functionality.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we designed more transparent channels.
This portable digestive system, when you stretch one end to another end to another, 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football pitch, and 10 times more than our thin gut.
And here it is, as a primate at TED, our first portable, programmable liquid channels in the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shelley said, "We're heavy-duty creatures. Only half is made."
What if design would provide the other half.
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, they would repair the damaged tissue, and they sustain our bodies.
Think about this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
Now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
It grows. Addition with sophistication.
This cockroach of the worm -- for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which is metabolized.
It's not additive to this level of sophistication.
It does it through combination not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different
An act as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, bringing those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first is learned in the environment, creates a stress structure, and then it starts to roll a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the commitment, the two forces of life, manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we pasted a small magnet to the head of a silk worm.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cap of silk worm.
However, by putting the silk worm on a flat, not inside a box, we realized that there was a flat cocoon and still meritocratic sandwich.
So we started designing different environments, different analysis, and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the cap, is directly transmitted by the environment.
Often they get rid of silk worms to death inside their knees, their silk releases and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these platforms we could shape the silk string without incurring a single cap.
You'd become strongly metabolized, and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a cleft robot making silk platforms, and we put in our site.
We knew silk worms towards darker and cold regions, so we used a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or openness, to block the rays of light and heat, distributes the silk worms about structure.
We were prepared to get to the organs.
We asked 65,000 worms of silk to an online silk farm.
And after feeding them four weeks, they were prepared to helice with us.
We put it carefully on the bottom edge of the scaffolding edge, and as they were helicing, they criter, they were starting, they put eggs, and life starts again like us, but much, much lower.
Buckminster Fuller said the tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By spinneret biological silk on silk raining robotically, they give all this pavilion their intelligence.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, 5,000 worms of silk have 65,000 miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of silk route.
The hills, after the elixination, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional balls in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk silk through a robotic arm, the other full void.
If the last frontier of design is to provide products and buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must unite these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that led us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature in the design that demands of us, for the first time, to make us charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be out?"
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can show it with your toes.
Three. Five. Three, five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be out?"
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be out?"
The problem was not that I didn't have any interests, but I had too much.
In school I liked English, the matters and art and developing websites, and besides, I was playing the guitar on a band called Telephone Frankenstein.
Maybe you've heard of us.
And I generally like to test and persist anyway, because I'd spend a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of abuse, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it gets to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested in something else, something totally different, and I dive into it, and let me absorb and I'm "Yes." I found this point where I start to get bored.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and distinct, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, I would deny all my other passions and resist to me.
Another reason why I caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not defining for anything.
I was concerned to have fear of commitment, or to be disposed, or to extract my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I'd like to ask myself that I have been raised then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it, they learned it from culture.
We asked ourselves what you want to be older?"
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you answer at that age.
It's considered an naive question to provide nice answers in children like, "Be a "Dance or "Well, "I want to be paradox."
They insert Hallel disapprovement here.
This question is done again and again as we grow up in different ways, per sea, high school students are asked they're going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be older?"
It turns out to be the cute exercise of before the dreams of the dream.
Why?
Although this question inspired kids to dream with what they could be, they weren't inspired to dream with everything they could be.
In fact, it does just the opposite of it, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things -- although well-intentioned adults maybe laugh and say, "Oh, what nice but you can't be a violation of violence and psychology.
You've got to choice."
This is Dr. Bob Chiles  and he is an army of violin and psychiatrist.
And this Amy Nairo, publisher publisher in an illustrator, company, teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very identified in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real vocalist, the idea that each of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who's not connected to this way?
What if there are many different themes that wake up your curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for somebody in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with one.
There is nothing wrong with you.
You're a multituse.
A crowd is somebody with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a cockroach to say.
I could help if you divide into three parts: multiple, potential and dance.
You can also use other terms that connect the same idea, as a resort, reconciliation.
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was fine in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Shermer refers to us as "Sterious."
Use any term you like or invent yourself.
It seems to me as a species of adapting to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see multi-form as limitation or association that you have to sell.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three multi-formal superheroes.
One: Seconds of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
Theo Hawaii and Rachel Bicock voiced their interests shared in cartilage, visualization of data, travel, math and design as I was founding Mello.
Member is a company that creates black jewelry geographically inspired.
And Sharon and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his ecosystem blending of skills and experience.
Innovation happens in intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And the multi-built people, with all their backgrounds, can access a lot of these points of interaction.
The second multi-conscious superpower is the rapid learning.
When we're interested by something, we go to it.
We observe everything we can have in our hands.
We're willing to be printed, for having been so many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort areas.
Many abilities are transferred to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we pursue -- so we rarely started from scratch.
No Dune is a full time journey.
As a pianist child a personal ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest machine known.
Before becoming a writer, I was not financial planning.
He had to learn the most final selling mechanics when he started his practice, and this skill helps him write compelling launch for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers for publishers
It's rarely a waste of time dedicated to what you're attracted to do, even if you finally leave it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have anticipated.
The third multinational superpower is adaptability. That is, the ability to become anything you need in a given situation.
Abe Capitle is sometimes director of videos, other websites, web pages.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because he can take diverse roles depending on the needs of his customers.
The Economist magazine defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and amazingly, which are the individuals and organizations that can pivot to fulfill the needs of the market, which really will thrive.
So seconds of ideas, quick learning and adaptable, three abilities where the fundamentalists are very habitable, and three abilities that could be lost if they're prepared to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in feeding the multi-built ones to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multi-formal problems, and we need creative creative thinkers.
Say they are, in their heart, specialists.
They came out of the train, knowing they wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeon.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a multi-conscious manufacturer.
The acoustician can dive deep and put in practice ideas, and the crowd offers a knowledge of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that replace how we are connected.
And unfortunately, multi-built people largely are given to them to be more like their specialized partners.
Once it said that, if there's one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope it's this: Recognizing with the internal wire, whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist, then especially for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of yes.
But for the multi-built variables in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, reconcile with their many passions.
Follow your curiosity.
Exploring the interactions.
Embracing our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy lives.
And perhaps most importantly, multi-conflict, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In 1991, a woman named Austria took it to a psychiatric in Francisco.
It was slowing up and couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alpha.
Allende didn't know how to help And And I was looking for her until, unfortunately, he passed in 1906.
After his death, Allands did an autonomy and found weird plates and overseas in the brain of Austria, of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more startling.
If you were alive today, we couldn't give it more aid than Alliance gave him 111 years ago.
Alpha was Dr. Allison Alexander.
And Austen Determan, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1901, medicine has advanced a lot.
There are antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infection, many treatments for cancer, anthropologists for HIV, stations for the cartoons and so much more.
But little has been moved in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alexis now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million people, by the way, including many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the chance of contracting Alzheimer's.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their golden years with Alzheimer's or helping take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's.
Only in America, the Al-Qaeda care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today, it's the most expensive illness, and its costs yield an increase five times in 2050, as it enhances the generation of the baby boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't prevent.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's cancer despite the fact that it costs us more than Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know about, but everybody should say, "Allegory is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, everybody, even scientists, confuse Alzheimer's.
We think it's going to be senior in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only a picture of a healthy aging brain compared to the patient of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to declining a severe memory of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's survival, and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alexander found plates and outbreaks in the brain of August a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like a origami.
There are places on paper that are peak.
And when it folds okay, these sticky dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots stay on the outside.
This makes protein molecules paste each other, forming groups that can form large plates and objects.
That's what we see in the patient brain with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and identifying what happened to block is complex.
Course a wire could do nothing.
mowing the others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that block it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, mostly they have reduced the cables and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, genes, chemicals, physicists, engineers and math.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now piloting a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside of our laboratory has seen it yet.
So let's look at some videos of what happened by testing these drugs in worms in worms of it.
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, they have molecules of protein that stick together within them, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 114 years of hope, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope to beat Alzheimer's. We need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to know that Alzheimer's is a disease, and that if we try it, we can see it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have invaded more research and exercise on governments, pragmatic industry, about scientists and legislators.
That was essential to move on the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today, we see that same unit to sell cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too far to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
The Al-Qaeda is not most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risks.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Austin, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
Help me talk about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in New York Modern column in January this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when I tried it myself.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are turned to be 36 questions more and more personal questions and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number 12, if you could wake up with a quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 28, when was the last time you cried to somebody else?
And alone?
As it advances, these are more and more personality.
Number 10: This really likes me -- "Tell your partner what you get from him, or she -- I know very hard this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever met.
When I hit this study, a few years ago, a detail was really called me the attention, the joke that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the laboratory to the ceremony.
So, I was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also intrigued.
And when I had the time to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to love myself.
However, we fell in love, and  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the column Amory Modern a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already aggregated, so I guess some of you probably are wondering, are you still together?
And the reason I think they're questioning this is because they've asked me this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before it was published, the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I was forced to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can reach up to a few hundred views, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends and imagining that my article in the New York Times was probably reaching a few thousand views.
And that was a good attention burden in a relatively new relationship.
But as he went, I had no idea.
The article posted on a Friday at night, and already Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, they already called me the Soon Show and the Good Morgan America.
Within a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with silence about loving experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or writing, what they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question: Are they still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the basket of my email with the phrase, "Are you still together?"
Multiple messages popped up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and remarkable citizens like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and asked it.
I even gave a talk, and a woman cried up to the stage, "Hey, Mandela where is your navigation?"
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship on an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the research of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have covered life.
In fact, the New York Times published a comprehensive article for San Valley, who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse in this whole attention was to be very restructured with my own relationship.
I said "no" to every request that we both did a public approach together.
He recruited TV interviews, and rejected the orders of us two of us.
I think I was afraid to become the unintended icons of the process of beginness. A range for which I didn't feel at the absolute climate.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: I mean, if I was able to produce enduring love, not just an adventure, but real love, real love, but real love, real love.
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer myself.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going together or not, and also say to me?
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of asking these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the goal of researchers was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, it was looking for me to promote interpersonal approach between college students, using what Armstrong was called sustainably sustainable, progressive and recovery.
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
Participants felt closer to do it. Multiple studies were also used as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of police and community, and they've used it among people of opposite political ideology.
The original version of history, which I tested last summer -- which combined personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this paper, but unfortunately, it never happened.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small university of liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and told me with size: I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed disconcerted about it.
And I said, Do you mean that you fall in love with the person who did it?
Well he paused a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
Did you feel you knew better after testing the study?
The assistant.
So, works," I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when you go to love.
I came up with the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was basically my whole adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or she could live without him.
So I came up in science.
I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could sort of vaccinate the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought only researching for the book I wrote, but in hindsight, it looks really obvious.
I thought if I was armed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I sat back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I look for.
But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can help me.
So what I'm looking for love is a garage, not just being loved today and being loved to be loved by being loved by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that media said about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to love.
There may be a way to mitigate some way to mitigate some of the impossible risk, and this is a very backward story, because love makes us feel wonderful, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that asks, still follow together?
And your content with a yes or not.
So more than a question, I would argue that we ask more difficult, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are complicated, and how do you know when to cut and distort it?
How do you live with uncertainty.
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love to love.
So, if you want the quick version of my relationship, it is this: a year ago, a meeting and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we love, we are still together, and I'm very happy.
But love is not the same thing to remain love.
Formation is the easy part.
So at the end of my article I wrote, the love didn't happen.
We stayed in love because we take the choice of it.
And I am a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was going to be that choice.
Not to consider how many times we would have that decision, and how many times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before it will always choose me.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody so generous and kind, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest day in America.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't really think.
And what I find, and what maybe spending my life searching is that that myth is true.
I want the fine happy happiness in the title of my paper, which is the only part of the article that I didn't really write.
But what I have in change is the chance of choosing to love somebody, and the hope that he will love me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian lesbians in full mountain, and in a way, I came up with a geometry of the forest.
New York City a while; something that really affected me but more detail forward.
I'll start with eight years old.
I took a wood box, and buried a one-dollar bill, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat spaggers.
I had no idea.
However, it has grace. Because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment when I was in Hawaii -- I like to go from exceptional and make surface and all these weird things -- and I was making a chocolate for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I screamed up all the pages and I did a kind of calculated celebration to the dissertation Agnes Martin Martin, he covered it from resin, and a bee was stuck.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's allergic to them, so I added more resiliency in the canvas, thinking that I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite happened: Somehow it seemed to increase as if it was to look at the text with a magnifying lap.
So I did that? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was going on on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate to them and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my gosh, I can draw in space.
I can flow traces, draw the same way around a card on the crime scene.
And I took the objects, and I created my own temperature of invented specimens.
First, the bookstores.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the resil caps.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, to go to Silicon.
I was great, man.
At some point I'm interested in human form, sculpture sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was dead.
I didn't know what to do, because the retina was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing in a window window, then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition.
And this really works, so I could stop using the resin.
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big, which I call "the "Tripod."
For the tragedy inspired me largely in "The Darwina Dragon Dragon Dragon," which is a painting at the Museum of Princeton in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the tragedy." I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Fifty meters long.
It has two faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little odd.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, there is Jesus and the lands.
There is a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of performance, this inflational mesh infrared where they hide.
This is where creatures with animals of animals are going to the end, ready to kill them in mass controlling in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised with thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a stroke.
Billy Graham is in the sea, the Horserier -- the oil platform of the street -- Walter -- the Obama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Of all, it's also a kind of crowd.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits oil in one hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like balances, and it looks like a mythological being that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the tragedy."
It's a little bit of a storyteller.
That's the hand that I hit.
And then when you go on the other side, you have a trap, like a bird peak, and you spit up clouds of this trap.
It also has a 5,000-year tail of a snake tail that joins the tragedy."
Of all, your tail starts fire when you stand on a volcano.
I don't know why I happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in an ocean balloon made of terrorist cards.
Have you seen them?
They did in the 1980's, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very late at its time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, one is called psychiatrists."
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive.
But each act as a kind of file in a way of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they split.
And you can walk between them. It's taken me.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the head -- it's the chest. You can get the ticket.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or not, or whatever it is, a kind of anger thing.
It's a quick passage of these work because I can't explain them for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a broken body in half.
This has two head, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that go out and enter the head of this strange statue street.
There is a little forest scene inside the triplet of the triplet.
Can you see it?
However, this talk is about these boxes, like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick coat. It's called Pixing World.
Within this box there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio scan -- a museum, a school, an editorial arm that broadcasts all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We put the box and all the people inside of them with others like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're redefining who is and the box is alive.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same material and the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with dulling and usually we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take an aspiration.
But so that this pill has access against grief, first passes through the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective system and the pink system so that any specific medication is in the body.
The disappearance, though, is that when we swallow it any medication is diluted.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take anti-comparison drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in blood and increase the CD cell.
But they're also known by their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time they take away the blood current, they dilate, and worse even for the time they take into their destination, which is where it's more important, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like lymph nodes -- the nervous system, lungs, where the virus is incompassionate, and not easily into the bloodstream.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of the treatment of HIV with current drugs that is a lifelong treatment that is administered by oral life.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Could we get the treatment directly into the deposition of the virus, without the risk of dilemma diligning?"
As an expert in laser, the answer was in front of me: Lass, of course.
If they're used in dentistry, for wounded and surgery of diabetes, they can be used for any unimaginable thing, including the interrogative transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
Maybe they say, "How is that possible?"
We sent a small and powerful ray of laser on the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser penetrates the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microscopes.
Before I even notice, the hole is immediately represented.
We're now testing this technology in vitro or Petri dishes, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that possible?" You can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three-stranded device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make an incision at the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an impulse that distributes the drug, releases it directly at the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem very long.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the HIV research in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not states: armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or military.
I documented what groups do when they're not shooting up.
My goal is to understand better to these generation generators of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition of violent involvement to nonviolent confrontation, not violent.
I do field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
No.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, from the 216 peace peace agreements between 1957 and 2011, 1960 was signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these groups -- we can even engage them or defeat them in any problem-solving process.
But how do we do that?
We have to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they fight, how they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and policies are not armed by armed arranged.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less defeat them, without a global vision.
Coltan groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the Lebanese Liberty, known by his violent facility against Israel.
From his creation in the 1980's, Henry has also established a political, a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, Palestinians Hamles, known by its suicide attacks against Israel, also manages the Gaza Bay since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking.
They set up a complex machinery, relational machinery, radio stations, TV websites and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the IED, printed in English and published.
The armed groups also invest in a complex reconfiguration of funding without salts, but by reconfiguring reconcilerations, for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups do something else: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they manage hospitals -- they put together a professional training program or microscope programs.
Helbows offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state is not developing, security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban talents in a standard Afghanistan by war, or even the beginning of the ISIS station, can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But, generally, providing social services, means filling a cow, a gap left by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 of Palestinians Paris can't understand without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at the armed groups -- we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or vision in the long term.
These groups are hybrid bones.
They grow because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge like armed and political groups participate in violent struggle and govern governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are, we can categorize them as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like Hebrew?
They dominate part of a territory -- they manage all their functions, collect the trash, manage the sewers system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebellion group?
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is IDEO?
The lines are distributed.
We live in a world of states, of nation-state and hybrids, and the weaker.
This is important for governments because to counteract these groups they will have to invest more than military tools.
To fill that glass of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and conquer peace.
If we understand the armed groups better, we will understand better how incentives to promote the transition of violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can earn some battle, but not give peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of safety, to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are very straightforward, but I fear that embracing the label of Fennosion would be unfair for pheromones.
I'm a feminist but pretty bad.
And therefore, I am pleased as a bad feminist feminine.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The Bad Feminist" and then in interviews, people started calling me the Fellow Feminism.
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a deliberate development, has become bigger something bigger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had weird ideas about feminists -- these furry women angry with men and they hated sex, as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how they treat women all over the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people as I could be feminist.
Being tagged as a feminist was an accusation.
I was thrown up like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is too high, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that rebelling woman, until you realize that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
Eventually, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are refragile: women are equal to men.
We deserve the same soup by the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we will, free of touch, or violence.
We have right to use easily and accessible the contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, with no need for legislative control or evolutionary medications.
We have the right to respect.
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to take into account our other identities.
We're not just women.
We're people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality condition, social condition, skills and so much more.
We have to take into account these differences, and how we affect, the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of include, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are apparent.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad feminist for me.
I have another conference.
When I drive, I listened to the job, I listened to a rap music gang at all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and forgets me deeply, the classic "Salmon Shark of English Twitter is unbelievable.
"Make it reality with your clothes.
Perfect, dance, move until you get the cockpit."
Think about it.
Pure poetry, right?
I'm completely mortified by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  -- all the household tasks but also kill insects, the salt of trash, the care of the lawns, and the nest maintenance of machinery.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazine and beautiful things.
I can see "The Balcon and the Romantic communities, and I have an absurd fantasies of the stories that make them happen.
Some of my offenses are more described.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I accept that choice, too.
The problem is not economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confused in ways that makes women economically vulnerable when they choose choice.
We solved this problem.
Remind the conventional feminist that has ignored or devastated historically the needs of color women, workers and hostile and transgendered women, in favor of white, heterosexual women, headlines of middle class and tall.
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist female.
The following question: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put discarded feminists into a period.
We hope they are going to be driven.
When we're disconnected, we remove them very much like the same portrait where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster -- I already consider myself from that presence before they try to get there.
Many women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as feminists.
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a feminist for fear of what that tag is, for fear of not being able to fulfill with a little realistic expectation.
Take Beijing, or as I call it, the God.
Over the past few years is a declined feminist feminine.
In the video Museum Adams in 2014, on MTV on the word "Former Feminist word Feminist."
It was a magnificent show, to see this star star openly embracing the feminism and the young men who will be female is something to be proud of.
By the time, cultural critics started unthinkable debates if Beijing was or not exactly feminist.
They were rating their feminist, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and a half.
We demand perfection, because we're still fighting for much, we want a lot, we need so deeply so much.
We go far beyond the feeling of sensible and constructive criticism to design the femining of any woman, destroying it until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminist, or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point.
But what happens next?
We move from recognizing our imperfections.
If I hear degraded music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be happier by providing a open-ended supply.
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until we eliminate change effectively affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has its music to be so smashed?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my niece, three and four years.
These are two magnificent girls and decisions and shiny and also very brave -- I want you to grow up in a world.
You are appreciated by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, suddenly, the best option is visualized as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sports one, via Tree Jung.
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women as dramatic objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers like bars of bag.
In any case, men, especially the white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until you don't have enough numbers of women, so much to participate how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your advertising, or your organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are super-exponentially but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also refuse to be included to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome barriers to the decision-making period.
Since we're not mere penis. Without these efforts, without embracing these positions -- our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top, to people in power directors and movie products and music, CEO, the legislatures -- people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and significant change.
We can also claim our feminism, good, bad, or anything.
The last line of my book "Wow, "Man Feminist," he says, "I'd rather be a bad feminist not to be at all."
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because my voice was stolen and feminism helped me to get it.
There was an incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids advised me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
They took my voice, and after all, I didn't dare to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I came back to me.
I grew up in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is more powerful than you can measure.
Through writing and feminist, I also discovered that if I was a little bit dangerous, another woman could see me and realize that none of us is the thing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humble reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist female, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same.
I hope you can all be a little bit brave, when you need such a value.
Just after Christmas last year, 132 children in California, they had a measles in California, or to be exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infect over 100 children in Hebrew.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century, but many of the kids involved in the Disney Brown had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly even worse, autism.
But a moment was not the article that sparked the police about autism and decomposed vaccines, declared and slaughtered by being a fragmentation by the British Medical Journal British?
Do you don't believe the majority of intelligent scientists that the vaccine is causing autism is a stupid?
I think most of you know, but millions of fathers around the world are still afraid that vaccines put their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the rise of autism over time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pedagogy that I had heard of them create their entire career life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence remained stable only three or four children per 10,000 boys.
But then, in the 1970s, the numbers started to melt.
Organizations of financial fundraising like Australia Spielberg is automatically referred to autism as an epidemic as if I could tell you about another child in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Atlantic Disease Center, what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like "compromise diagnosis and a better detection of cases to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't dissipate a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks at the face of his three-year-old child -- visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and caregiver of science than with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be false, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here, and where we have to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist Leo, Leo Kneel, from the hospital Johns Hopkins Hospital, in 1973, Kander published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds -- people around him, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their hands before their faces, but they were prisoners of the panic by mentalities like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of patients treated in their clinic, Kanzi speculated that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the topic, I declare that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his lander while harvesting the references of places as far as South Africa.
This is not really surprising, because the Krison criteria for the diagnosis of autism was very restrictive to diagnosing autism.
For example, I was going to give that diagnosis to children with conversations, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had been taxed that he had turned nine out of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his comfort for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kanne was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not accurate.
I classify autism as a form of child psychotic psychotics caused by cold and disconcerted parents.
These kids, he said, have been carefully kept on a fridge, not disconcerting.
At the same time, Kennedy noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that go in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in his clinic could distinguish between 18 synapses before they were two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite discussions, he correctly said, "Benevolence.
But Kneen had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were just regurgitating what they had heard their parents, desperate to earn their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the Knee theory that autism was weird.
Long Nigerian, cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mother New Kennedy was quite stupid.
She and his husband, John was warm and affected, and they had a profound autistic daughter called Susan.
Lorent and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Susia without services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Lord and his colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism protection in general population.
They pioneered a suburb in London called Cambridge to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the Kangar model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some children couldn't talk at all, whereas others were rooted in their fascination by astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or the genealogy of it.
Otherwise these kids didn't fit in beautiful and sharper squares as Judaism, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Monologue model in Kenya would have predicted.
Early on, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had no percentage of these children before?
But then Lorraine found a reference to an article published in German in 1949, the year after the Kansas article. And then forgot, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kant knew about this article of competition, but he avoided deliberately to mention it in his own work.
There was not even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of Latin spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Apple, who ran an integrated clinic with an internal school in Vienna.
The ideas of Apple for teaching children with learning differences were progressive even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with kinds of exercise with music, and children follow their games in the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Apple described it as a psychological disability of life that required compassionate forms of support and spaces for the course of the entire life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Abolt called her little teachers, and he was dedicated to help the development of methods of education that were especially suitable for them.
Crucially, Apple saw autism as a diverse continuum that was going through a staggering variety of donations and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in known architects as the awkward social scientist and the distracted teacher.
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, an audience of autism is essential.
Lorent and Judith discovered that Kanzi was wrong when autism was incredible, as well as parents were.
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the U.S. Association to expand the criteria criteria that would reflect the diversity of what they called "artist" astronaut."
By the end of the 1990s, the changes in the '90s, his change came into virgin, replace the limited model of Kanzi by a wide and an even Apple Apple.
These changes were not skydiving.
Carefully, when Lorraine and Judith worked between baseball to reform these criteria, people from all over the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out in 1988, only a little circle, excavated by experts knew what autism was for; but after the indomitable act of Dusty Hoffman as Raga Babbage's and the recognition of "Mary Man" with four awards of the Academy, pediatrists, psychologists, professors and fathers around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, the first clinical trials were introduced to diagnose autism.
No longer had a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
"The combination of "Dance Man" changes changes in the criteria and introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism awareness.
The number of diagnosis started to rise up, just like they predicted Lord and Judaism, they were actually expecting that to be, making people with autism and their families finally got the support and services that were deserved.
So Andrew Whitman came to blame the vaccine of vaccines for the income in diagnosis. A simple, powerful history of a credible history as the Kansan theory that autism was incredible.
If the current estimate of preventing that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzle is to solve by new medical advances, acting the term neuroscientists to celebrate the variation of human cognition.
One way to understand neurosurgery is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows, doesn't mean it's cracked.
According to the authoritarian standards, the normal human brain is easily distributional, obsoletely social, and it suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Apple -- who believed that "cure for the most exciting aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, Googlers with complexity, support, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Zoels Zakes once said, "We need all the hands on covered to address the boat of humanity."
As we navigate towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
