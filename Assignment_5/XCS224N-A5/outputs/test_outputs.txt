You know that what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the car for children, more read in the United States.
And I always say to the people I don't want to look like a scientific science.
I can see it as a artist, or with the room, and I never had a correction.
I'm here today to talk about crazy and college.
And you know that a great control is something that you put up in some place.
You just have to go back to the mountain to see it as a control.
That's the piece of a career.
A friend did that -- Richard Bangladesh.
This is the kind of complex care of which I'm going to talk about.
My school started in the middle of the middle school in the middle school -- North Wall where I was the room of the car.
So they were going to go back to every week in the base of the girls -- until a teacher took me life.
She came up my life to allow me to go into the back of the programmers of space.
I was doing it in society.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a particular, and it ended up in San Francisco -- California -- I found a love -- and in the 1980s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were going to work against the AIDS
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call of that show, the San Park who said, "I need to see it.
I'm designed that we have never been able to meet it.
You could come to Angeles, and please go to that man I know you've already found it.
And I have to tell you that I have cancer cancer, and I would like you to tell you about this for family."
Well, the next day we were in Congress.
We were going to see, we came up, and we realized that she needed to be hospital.
We found it a place, and we found it, and we can take it out of his family, because it was necessary to us.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to know as a action came to me, it became a box box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the care had been concerned, it had become a crazy -- and that control that I talked to you about itself was done in itself.
The control is that death is part of life.
She took my life, my father and I take the one of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs real and beauty and I'm very happy that today is a lot of this.
It also needs -- I need digital -- love and plant. And it's our work to protect those things.
Thank you.
As an artist is very important to me.
And through my work, I'm trying to explore that humans are not sitting from nature and that everything is interested.
I went for the first time about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first food.
I was assumed.
My heart heart, I was right, trying to understand what was behind me.
The food to me around the water almost 60 meters -- and I couldn't more than to think that it was about a network of nine dollars a year after year.
The electrons are born when it comes out of the galaxies or they get up the ice shoes.
Every child has their own individual perspective.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experience.
Some of them are going to get up to the end of the end, while others can't be able to put it more and they get in a distribution of a digital space.
It is easy to think about it, by looking at a collection, which are sensitive sensitive and sun -- in a big disease as we see us sometimes as humans as well.
But the reality.
As you go up with a contract, I'm going to tell you their own attention to it.
As you go up with a little bit of a little bottom water on the market that feed a lot of life.
I'm going to ask you to photograph these elements as if you were trying to try to make my antibiotics, you know that in these only single moments there are that way and they will not get out of that again.
It's not the death when they disappear, it's not an end, but a control of his way in the middle of life.
So part of the ice of the ice that photograph is very young -- it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you are a show that photograph in Kenya, Gallery.
It's a little bit to get a lot to be able to get a really high environment.
Here you go.
You can see the left a little book.
It was about five feet.
And I would like you to pay attention to the form of the electron and their favorite line line.
You can see here, it starts to reach here, the battery has moved into the other side and the man is there.
This is a stage of Galand, in a average size of it.
You get out of the water about a few feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so you know, the body shows a different side of their perspective.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two times in 1998, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single monkey is a baby book.
So, two times every one with a book.
I don't want you to make it too much in the development of it, because if you have to think about the concept in yes, they don't be able to pay attention to me.
We think about that for a moment.
And in this room I want you to imagine that, in a case, the collection and the species is going to take the 1980s of the cloud.
And in the other case, the 19th percent of the hope is going to take the 1980s of the world.
They are both trying to understand the life.
We're going to talk about them.
And in my solar activity to make two reasons.
In one of my rules, I work with the story of the attack.
I am a story for the world and what I study in this case is the way that people are going to be able to say, of human bodies and animals -- how they have been able to think of the collective forces -- the idea of the body, what have thought about the body.
The other robot that I wish in my work is the action, as a process of patients or as I say sometimes -- designers of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical conditions are provided the social notes.
I've been working for example, for example, two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with antibodies, people much better than the middle of it.
And I've worked with a lot of kinds of people with sexual sex -- individuals whose physical image is not in the male markets and construction metaphors.
In general lines we can call it.
The international advanced many ways.
I'm going to put you some examples in ways of ways to have a sex that doesn't get in the form of market or metal common or metal.
For example, it's the case of the individual car with the core collection of the collection -- and he says to the programs, that we all have in the perfect life, which is going to be transformed.
And then, in the front life, the tools can produce them.
But because this individual happens to be able to be able to resolve the same.
It is the interview of interviews to the antibiotics.
And so there are a little bit of terrorists -- but yet not relationship.
As a control, the body is developed to keep a little bit of a complete car.
And when you know, the baby has a little bit of girl.
It's a little girl -- it's creating like a girl as a girl one.
And often it is not even to the poll, when it's growing up and develop the senses, but it doesn't have a mental period when someone is realized that something is going on.
And then you can make sure that instead of having events and this, it actually has terrorists and a crime and a career.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men -- we have in the body something called survival galaxies.
They're in the body part of the body.
The subject protecting architecture, the rate of market.
Most women like I -- I know a typical woman -- I don't know how to be a criminal structure -- I think it will be a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to the antibiotics.
We produce antibiotics and we respond to the antibiotics.
As a control, someone like me have the most successful brain to the antibiotics that the woman who was born with terrorists that have the influence of interviews to the antibiotics.
So the sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the interfaces are in the middle of the space, in some way can be everywhere.
Another example -- a few years ago, I got a call of a 18 years ago, I was born and creating as a work, and I had a sense of sex resources with it, he took a life as a daughter and I was just trying to figure out that he had forests and there.
It had an extreme form of a disease known as a control surgery as a control surgery.
I had a cloud of the 21st and the thing the surgery was so active that they were so active that, in fact, they created a dark environmental environment.
As a control, their genes were marketing, their brain was successful to the moral companies in the dark computer.
I was born with a child -- no one spending anything.
And it was at the age of 12 years when I started having medical problems that were protected by the Internet, when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman in the way.
Well, another example of an extra case of infection.
Some people with climate crisis to develop what you know as a subject, is to say, they have an old thing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We don't know why it happens.
So, there are a lot of sex sides.
The reason why children with this kind of body -- are a bottom, the single bears, or interviews, you get up to the neurons that are not to be able to walk from a better physical health.
In many cases the people are particularly healthy.
The reason why you get up to a lot of subjects is that they are a threat for our social center.
The system is based on the idea that a particular approach is going to be able to get a particular idea.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a former identity to be able to have a black identity, and it will be black to say to have Africa in terms of history.
A simple idea.
And when you ask a body that shows something pretty different -- we have problems with carbon.
So we have very radical ideas in our culture in our culture.
Our nation is based in a very relative institution.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children who are born as two people inside the same body.
The other recent case is the last year with the South African Country Carl Santa, and he put up in the stage of his sex in the international Internets of Berlin.
A lot of particles call to ask me, "What are you going to be able to be able to do in order to figure out if Carl Sea is man or women."
And I had to explain to you to the particles that there is no example.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that nature is so complicated that nature is not a whole line between men and women or women or women and women and women and women, we are us who we take that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more advanced science -- the more we have to deal with that these cars -- we think of these cars -- and we thought that they were straightforward collective care careers that are disappearing with self-assembly institutions -- they're much more difficult than we think.
And not just in terms of sex terms of sex ...
It's also in terms of reason, something that it turns out much more complicated than the control allows it.
As we see, we're going to take it in a strange terror.
Let's look at it, for example, the fact that we share at least 90 percent of DNA with children.
What are we going to think about the fact of them in just a few neurons?
And as we protect in science we give us more and more in an amazing area in which we have to recognize that the simple conditions that we're going to do is probably too simple.
And we're looking at this in all of the human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the faces at the end of the life.
It's hard to look at a moment of which a body gets human and it has different rights to the pictures of the picture.
There are a very expensive device today -- it's not in public -- but I know inside the medicine -- it is going to when someone would be dead.
Our ancestors had never got to fly with this question of if someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a piece of the night and if you move it still they didn't work.
If I stopped moving it out.
But we can today, for example, to give you a video organs of a body and put them into another body.
And as a conversation -- we have to focus on the way to actually do the death of someone -- and this brings us into a difficult situation where we don't have the simple cars of the past.
And maybe you think that this collective exploration could come to someone like me.
In particular, I am protecting the people with unique bodies -- but I have to act that I would make it news.
And I will tell you that these creatures are much more amazing than we thought about what we think about.
You have the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this figure out that I have to deal with that I'm a little limitation of the Palestinian Palestine.
I know they were religions, I know they were simple, but they were big.
I mean, they were so valuable and some of them and so rate in what they did -- that I found me every single bit of looking at that machine -- and not for the music -- which is completely fascinating.
That's why I happened in 1874 with the Palestinian Pathernity.
The Palestine parents were for me, the first access of the atmosphere and explain for you.
And what they were able to do was I was a collective concept and they would take it up with another thing that was real and beautiful and it took for 200 years.
And as all of you remember, what our Palestinian parents was the idea of the movie. The movie was based in a very simple concept of the audience.
The old models of the old world don't know the DNA -- but they had clear the whole idea of it.
They had the blue concept of blue control.
They were the idea of the idea that they got to the political power for the top of the grandmother to the father and then the son, etc.
The Palestine parents were given that idea, and they would take it up by a new collective concept and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They looked at the field of game and they decided that the attention that I was important was the attack in common and not the distributed differences -- that was something very rich.
And in part they were doing it because they were doing part of a solar system where they were getting two things.
And he was taking democracy and at the same time I was born science.
And it was very clear -- if we look at the story of Paris Patients, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
And they were designed from the solar explanation and because they were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go out of an idea with a really high idea.
They were moving up to a natural control.
And if you look at it, for example, the Decision of the India, talk about nature and the God of nature.
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to say who we are.
And in fact, they were taking us the idea of the anti-consciousness control.
And by doing that, they were sitting the basis of the future of Congress Richards.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years later.
And the women.
Then I came up with the success of the Richard Richard Richard with people in the Caribbean Carteria, who said, "I'm not a woman.
We found men in the middle of the Richard Richard rights saying, "I'm a man.
Again, people of color that went to the autonomous control about the anti-activity difference and again, they were developed.
We see the same with the movement of December.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the controls, we have to start to start asking why we get certain diseases.
But I mean, I want to keep a few of them in our culture in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to tell you that we had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take you into the attack.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years they had to allow them to have sex relationships or care.
There are a few of them antibiotics that for me have sense and I think we should keep it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do you have sense.
Well, let's go back to those two people in the beginning of this talk.
We have two seconds, both of them controlled to 1960 exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mars, was born three months before time, the one percent of poor.
Homo, by the context -- I was born in term, I was born at the age of 1900 percent.
For the only fact of having been born three months before Mars will give you all the right three months before Hell the right -- the right to the security -- the right to the side, the right, the right to the right.
Hambut has to wait for all of that not because I have a different biological age, but because I was born later.
And we found other rules in relationship to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights to their rights
Home, in view of being considered a man -- and I don't tell you if it's 3D, in video of being a man now is possible to be able to be able to be able to worry about it.
Many, by his hand, doesn't have the same rights to the market that Harvard in all the states -- for example.
Hello can happen in all of the state with a woman with a woman, but Mars.
And so they still want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be problems and construction.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science is so much in the field of the atmosphere that we get to the point of having to make to make a based democracy in the audience could be able to deliver?
I don't want to go back to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going on.
Where do we go from?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of protecting activity, "Well, we have to bring the line in some part, so we're going to do it.
But a lot of people are going to happen in a word particular.
For example, Tennalas in a certain time has decided to be able to take a man not to have a man -- and that to reach with a woman you have to have a collection of it.
Now, in the practice they don't make a concept to the people.
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you to the beginning of the intelligence of the institutional institutions.
If you look at one of the most fundamental parents of modern democracy -- Dr. Mars Lady Kan, in his design "Did "The "done and so on.
He says that we should play people who are not in the color of their skin -- but in the context of their career, it will be beyond the attack.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very good.
But in space, how do you do?
How do you play people on the content of their care?
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we had to take them back to the people, because I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that they would probably make more social services that some humans that I know.
I also want to say that maybe some words that I know you can take more international decisions -- smart and markets about their sexual relationship that people from 40 that I know.
So how do you put the size of the control of control?
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me is asked what would happen if the cancer of one person could be moved in the future to be moved with an institution, maybe with a medical resources.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important to be very important that the United States is going to go up with this room of thinking about the size of democracy.
We have done a good job of democracy.
We don't live for example, for example, in a context that a man who feels left by other men is used to be able to be able to be able to get up to a sex change in whose case is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I would tell me that we don't have a context like a control that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give you to light teachers and so on and so on.
But when at the phone asked him the model of the opportunity -- a very relative opportunity, I was told that in that other country these children would be very completely completely and because I had to do it.
And I would say, "Well, have you built the political subject instead of the police season."
The United States, they have a huge possibility to the people to be who are not going to be able to change by the world.
So I think we have to be to the head.
Well, to end up I mean I have been talking a lot about the Patient.
And I want to think about how it would be democracy or as I could have been a lot of more position to Montana.
And I want to tell you something a little bit about a picture, and it is that I think you can have different ideas from different advanced images -- if there are people thinking about group.
From years ago, since I have been interested in influence, I've also been interested in research the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and power in the world.
And what we know about traditional studies is that women -- in average, not all of them -- but in average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationship and access to those who are value within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in the pain, one of my teachers I knew I was interested in the face -- I was very interested in the face -- like now, I made me a strange plant.
"I said, "Well, what is the friends of the financial."
And I thought, "It's the most amazing question I've heard of.
The face has to be able to get up with the galaxies -- so there is nothing foreign in the film."
But the more I have thought about his question, more has seen me to me that there is something wrong in the factory.
I mean, that there could be something -- in average, something different between the fundamental brain and the market that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most valuable.
So if the parents were very proud to find the way to protect people around the state of the state -- it's possible that there will be more likely to have more media to this concept -- maybe we would have gone up with the concept of the price with the right support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take the democracy beyond the audience, thinking less in the individual body, in terms of the identity -- and think more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect financial, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to recognize how we think about economic development
Our new goal should be that when every family has to be that when every family is going to go to live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a different city of different cities that are being able to go back to new results.
Well, at this moment we are far from that object.
There are thousands of people in developing developing countries that don't think of a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they get a lot more than their cost of building it.
So we could easily put it to the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can be able to make sure if you've never thought about new cities.
But you just take them up by building buildings on it.
Imagine that half of those who want to live in all of them and they were provided to the other half of the other half to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make sure in all of the successful building.
But you know that the problem that you would find is that those buildings and the areas that are going to get together in order to deal with the markets and the distributions of building it.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those relationships.
But you could go to a completely new place, building a whole new building building again, always and when the norms of that place will make the building instead of putting them out.
So it turns out that governments are going to be able to create new areas of research to get cities and I gave them a name -- cities under state.
More later I want to understand that more or less at the same time, James and California were thinking of the challenge of representative Hollywood.
They knew that every year about 75 hours are going to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could be able to get and do those same things in Hollywood.
And in the summer of the summer of 2008, I spent by a control conservation control.
And in the next few religion controls, Paris Palestinian has been used with a platform in which you produce resources and at the same time.
I asked Angeles that it was his head of gallery.
As so much, I was trying to give me a talk at TED.
And through a process of private, I think and a great amount of test and a great amount of test with users, trying to reduce this complicated community of cities under their most exciting ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those things that they say you can't go and put it to all of the activity of advances.
We put a lot of attention to new technology, but you need a lot of technologies as we need to protect -- and they are actually the ones that are going to be able to get up.
In the middle of 2010, a friend of Galax sent him to A correct with the TED.
I showed him to Japan.
They called me.
They said to me, "We put this to the leaders of our country."
So in fact, we got in Michael, in a room, in a horizontal room.
So I tried to explain this point about the values that are the cities -- much more valuable than their moral cost of it.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York -- Letter, terrorists that, in some cases, there are thousands of dollars per day.
But it was a pretty high discovery and at some point, when there was a place, Allin said, "Paper, maybe we could see the video of the TED Talk.
And the talk developed in a very simple city that a very simple city is a place where it starts with the discovery careers, a state that shows the rules that are going to come up there and an opportunity for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of Hollywood called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important -- this could be the way to be the way that our own country.
I asked me to go to Termology and I would talk about nine and five of them.
So I put another talk full of data, which including an image like this, which was trying to explain that to get a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of the Line and the white line is the new approach that is built in the Times.
It only goes up over 100 miles away to over 100 miles away.
So I was trying to convince the hospitals that to build a new city -- you have to start with a site that looks at the less than only one thousand miles away.
That's more than 100 humans.
The whole world is able to be able to come down.
The paradigms of the audience were very serious and advances.
The language of the control was going to the paper and said, "We were a long Robot, so thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TED Talk.
I have this in my computer."
So I sat and showed the TED.
And this is what it looks like is that a new city can offer new opportunities for people.
There would be a city of a city that you could be in Hollywood, instead of hundreds of thousands of dollars to the North North.
And it's also going to make new opportunities for the leaders too.
Because the leaders of the American government would need to help around countries -- they could benefit from the countries that are going to help them go and make the norms of the state -- so that they could all be able to trust them in which the state is actually wrong.
We went and we saw a century.
This picture is from there.
It could be able to add about a thousand miles away.
And a little bit later, 1960 percent of English, they were going on in the Congress to take their Conservation and open a computer device that allows us to create these special reports of developing it.
In a country that I was just going to go through this particular crisis -- the value in the College of this computer control was 12 to one.
And all of the particles, all the factors in society -- they did it.
In order to get in the Conservation, you have to try two times in the Congress.
The 17 percent of French came over again in another room, from 12 to one.
And it was able to go back after the value -- about 24 percent of us -- a distribution of about 30 hours went to the two places in the world that are more interested in being able to put in the building of cities.
One of them is Caring of the South.
This is a picture of a whole new part of the city that is built in North County, is bigger than the center of Bangladesh.
All you see there is built in four years, after they spent four years to get the personalities.
The other country in the building of cities is Santa.
In fact, you've already built two cities in China and they are putting for a third one.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a site -- and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are putting a legal system that allow the advances to come in, and at the time you allow to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put up
A country has already been built to allow her to allow her to be the last thing for this new control system.
There are college and companies of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get a little bit.
But the only thing we know is that they have a good number of surgery.
There are a lot of companies that would want to deal with the Africa, especially in a place with a place with a collective book, and there are a lot of people who would like to go out there.
In the world there are 500 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There are a million dollars a year that comes from America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents that have to leave their family to go back to your family to get a work, sometimes there are solar mothers that have to take the money for so just to eat or buy a role.
Like, sometimes there are even children who are trying to focus with their parents that have not seen -- in some cases, in a decade in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about the building of a new city in Hollywood?
Or to build a piece of these, or a control of these around the world?
What do you seem to think about to be able to do so that the families can choose between several cities that are connected to bring new resources?
So this is an idea that is going to be able to get it out.
And my favorite friends asked me to say, thank you TED.
I'm Japan, and this is my light.
But before I show you what there is before, I'm going to make a public conference -- and it is that, I live with the translations with the translations.
I love to figure out, selling, and more recently, to photograph and pay in my own transportation books, controlled and different and different things.
But it didn't buy anything again.
All my robot is about a second hand of particles and sense of second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The next hand allows me to reduce the impact of my relationship in the environment and in my biology.
I got to know the interesting people -- for the generation of my money goes to a good cause -- my point is only one, and building it in my own personal personality.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be my stage?
Do I like the context?
Do you take less than 20 dollars.
If all of the answers are positive -- then I feel that I have given up.
It will go back to the size of my life, I want to tell you what happens for this week in TED.
I mean, what would I do with someone who has all that corn?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm going to do.
I have been a whole bunch of correlation control, and nothing else.
I was interested in exactly a week is everything I've put in my lab.
I imagine that it would be able to find all the other thing that I want to use after you get here to Park Stanford.
And because I don't know as the woman who walked by TED in the interest --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the conditions for this week.
Do you have no interesting?
As I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lives of life that I would take it or not, I have learned in this advance of not using again.
Let's start with the deception.
This is what I call it back to it.
You don't have to take a lot of money to see good.
You know, you can always look at less than 50 dollars.
All the contract, including the car, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
Lands, the color is energy.
It's almost completely impossible to be a bad human, when you're looking at an red red plant.
If you're happy -- you're going to take other happy people.
Man: The interaction is survival.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the people, you don't just understand you, you will also get to you.
Michael: Give you the child who takes it into it.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I go to the designers, or I remember her little seven years.
I like to tell you and say, thank you.
They the control is the key thing.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it was not until the 30 years that really understood their meaning of it.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interest and experiment, there is no look at you that you can't go down.
So there is no except for any of this environment.
We need to be able to do everything we want to do.
Thank you.
Video: A green universe for you, the bone babies go with everything.
And finally, I forget to develop a personal person and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word for you.
I've tried it over and over again, when people came up with this week simply because of what I was using -- and we had a fantastic conversation.
All of this is not going to go in my little light.
So before I go home to Brazil, I'm going to give you everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave a few things.
I don't need to give you attention to these things, because at the back of the surgery, there will always be another crazy train, controlled and a bit of definition, if there's a little bit of love in my heart and saved.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a responsibility of your brain that we can develop in two parts.
The left side -- which is the legal part and the right side -- which is the international part of it.
So if we use a scale to measure the application of every health, we could design a role of our brain.
So for example, this would be somebody who is completely collaborative.
This would be something that is completely interactive.
So where do you take your brain on this scale.
Some of them would put up for one of these experiments -- but I think for most of the interest of this audience -- their brain is something that -- with a great position in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they are a concept of extraordinary.
You can be a legal and intervention.
I think of one of those people, which as most of the other economic physical physical physical physical physics -- we need a lot of limitation to control these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of innovation to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this interest? Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see as they respond. And then we developed our interest to the point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
And it turns out that you can have developed with the country of the years is the one that says one thing can be just in a place at the time.
I mean, it can be able to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you didn't need to do with this notion -- they developed it.
I remember to look at a child playing in a piece of statistic.
It was a small child and I didn't do it very well, it's always carrying.
But I guess that the playing with that piece of strategy taught a lesson value, and it's that the big things don't allow them to detect them, and they stay in a place.
This is a big model that you can have in the world, except that they are a picture of particles as well.
It would be a terrible model for a picture of particles -- because they don't play with the street streets, play with these little few little particles.
And when you play with their particles -- they found that they do all kinds of things -- as you can actually be able to bring them up, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all of these substances, and they call it the top of the quantum medicine.
And in that point he found the physics a few years ago, you need to be able to describe those little particles to describe those little particles here.
But you don't need to describe the big objects that are going around every day.
That was not a very good thing to me, and maybe it's because I don't play it very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a particular.
But it was not going to go well to my favorite part of me.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles are going to follow the main medical memory -- so I should not be all to follow the beginning of the control market?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel a lot better if I could be a way to show that a common object is also going to be the beginning of the quantum medicine.
That's why some years ago, I can do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it has been in a consciousness of the quantum medicine.
What we see here is a little bit of computer.
And you can try to see the green point right in the environment.
That is the metal point that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to make it a little bit. It's just in the center of it.
And then here we do a good thing to be a good tradition to the little traditional trade.
So what we see is a little piece of metal, with the form of transportation and that you can be able to put on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would make a computer character.
I went to a special room with a new school, and I got to work all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material -- I had to build my own machine -- to make this office with a form of national nation that is going to be under the device of the device that is going on.
So this device has the ability to be in a quantum surface, but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make a particular.
You know how amazing it is going to be in a film full of people.
I mean, when I'm in a street -- I do all sorts of things -- but then when other people are going to be able to do those things, because I don't want to do it, or in reality, I will be able to do it.
The quantum medicine says that the amazing objects are starting in the same way.
The journey of journey of the international objects are not just people -- it's also the light that would take it and the wind that happens to his side and the face of the room.
And so we knew that if we wanted this piece of medicine to be able to go back to the quantum music, we would have to explore all the other steps.
And that's what we did.
Let's take the lights out, then we set up a show and we explain all the air and then we put it up to a temperature of less than a distribution for the right car.
Now, when I was only in the shoes, the little piece of goal is free to act as I want to.
So we measure their movement.
We found that they move in very strange ways.
Instead of being able to get a little bit of perfect, I was looking at it, and the way I saw it was like an answer of this way -- like a force that goes up and get up.
And when I give it a complete subject, we could make it value and it doesn't go back to the same time -- something that only happens with the quantum medicine.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic thing.
What does it mean that one thing is, and it doesn't live at the same time.
So let's think about them.
In a case, all of the translations of us who are taking that piece of medicine that are like, and at the same time those same things are moving up to go up and for down.
It is just in the interviewing devices when they get down.
In the rest of the time they are developed.
It means that every task is in two different places at the same time, which sometimes means that the whole piece of goal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
All right.
I was going to be able to see it in a visual room to do this for all of those years, because you look at this, the difference in the scale between a single size and that piece of medicine is more or less the same thing that the difference between that piece of medicine and you.
So if a single thing can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of medicine can be in two different places, why don't you do it?
I mean, it's my favorite part that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you make your understanding if your body was developed in space space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we put it, and we looked at the lights and we looked inside the box and we saw that the goal went up there in a single point.
And I was able to get to this new infrastructure -- it would be able to be all the objects in the shoes in fact, are just objects that are just made in a little space.
You hear a lot about a lot about that the current market is entertainment that everything is interested.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more likely to do that.
And that's that those connections to all of the things you get down, literally define who you are. And that is the right program of the quantum medicine.
Thank you.
My name is All.
And I was 18 months ago, another work in Google -- until I took the idea of doing something relationship with machines and art to my journey that is here and I allow me to take it to the way.
I took me 18 months and me.
A lot of business and stories -- you know, with 18 very interesting machines in new countries.
But I'm going to focus on the side.
There are a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is just explain in this slide and this is the action.
I grew up in India.
You get a great education of a big education -- but I didn't have access to many of these machines and artists of art.
And so when I started to go back and go to music, I started to learn a lot.
And working in Google -- I try to do the desire to do more access to technology.
So we put a team -- a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than shows the love for you to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have taken up from his particular.
So, let's just go to George.
Look around all the machines that you have.
This is the face of the Philip, the Monterey, the Palestinian, the Vietnam, the Green Google.
In fact, I'm going to go in one of my favorite family, the Martin map of New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We make it close and spoken, we are in the machine.
It doesn't matter where they are, Bangladesh or Mars, that actually doesn't matter.
You move through there and they get away.
Do you want to take the machine?
We open up the back of the back, and with a single class, we go into the back.
They're inside that they want to go at the end of the screen.
They are going to go down.
They experience.
Thank you, but I haven't come to the better.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite particles, "The College Parks in the Mars.
I see the sea sea.
If the machine shows us the image -- we make it close there.
You see, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information information.
For those of you who are really interested in the art -- you can make it clearly there, but I'm going to make sure right now.
And this is one of the images that we've taken in what we call the digital technology.
So this image is, for example, you know, I think, about 10 million dollars.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 million streets?
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10 million dollars.
It can make a very simple way.
You see different things that are going on.
I love this girl -- your experience doesn't have any price of it.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started playing it, and I found something that happens there.
And I said to me, "You know, this looks like interest."
And I found out that children were actually playing something.
I invented a little bit, I talked to some people from the Martin, and I actually discovered that this is a game called the crime -- which is going to take a car with a place with a paradigm with a paradigm of California.
And it was a very popular thing.
I don't know why they do, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to make them even more in protection and you'll see that you can actually get even to the grandmothers.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective -- I'm going to get the image -- so you will see what there is really what you do.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come on, a second.
So now we're going to go back to the Montan in New York.
So here's another of my favorite names."
The example I showed was to find discovery.
But what if you want to see the fish?
And if you want to look at how they are going to actually create this word speed?
And it turns out it and truth that I do.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this short, and I'm really going to get to the grandmothers.
This is "The night?
I'm going to show you one of my favorite work.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part called "The "Caradol."
All of you, absolutely all of you, doesn't matter if it's rich or poverty, or if you have a market, that gives you the same.
You can be able to create their own museum to create their own color from all these images.
It's very simple -- we got -- I've created this function that I call "The power of the character: -- we just just made a guy around it.
It's about "The "West "The National Bank of London in London in London, in the National Galand.
You can add things, to send them to their friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at the order to control these amazing works.
And so I believe that for me, the main thing is, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google anymore.
No, in my mind, I even don't come from the machine.
Maybe I should not say this.
In reality, they come from those art.
And that has been my own experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media makes it a distribution of art and that is represented in the line.
And the big question that you do today is, you did this to answer the experience of going to a machine?
And the answer is not.
It's to share the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good to all.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a paradigm, a flower stage.
In our lab we call it a sense of sensitive.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am in this picture, all of the children in Earth grow with this picture in the wall of their correction, but the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the French cars in the last two decades in the last two decades here.
A few time ago, if you wanted to take a course of France one, he took a presentation and I had a good paradigm and a good car.
And if the car and the car was the good thing -- you put the career.
This is what it is, in English is called the control system in real time.
It is a system that is a system that has two companies -- a sense and a action.
Now what's interesting today is that the control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered from networks and effective.
They are getting computers at the air.
And as you know, they're starting to answer different and they can be designed and activity.
The cities is a big thing.
As I didn't want to imagine that cities are only two percent of the planet of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the global population.
75 percent of the energy, and even 80 percent of the CO2 exploration.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
More than the cities, all of these choices and adults are going to be in our own collective.
This is a presentation of Park Park for year of year in the Moral, during the second.
This is called "The "The "The "The "Hollywood "Honey!
Well, our object.
In a certain way it's as if almost all of us are going to be sense and actions.
And that is changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a certain sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michael Nigeria.
You know, when Bill National wrote the Monaphamic, you say that at the end I took the machine, and you get it to the Midsters -- you can still see a little mile -- and he said to me, "Well, he said, "We are a particular partner -- and what don't you talk about.
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk about.
And I'm going to show you just just a few examples -- you get in the idea of taking the environment and open something.
Let's start with the design.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago.
It was a sense with the 2007 in the way.
It was the year in which Einstein won the North County of the world.
And maybe some of you remember it, they would play Earth and Frank, and at the end of the Bill gave the head.
And all of all, at the end of the Earth walks.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the College in the middle and the North Trade.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is in the right part of time.
On the face there are people over here, and there are doing it called me -- moved.
It starts the part, solar.
Good from France.
Even though people make a quick call and go to the battery.
Second time.
First of all, a second.
Bob, and in a moment, the head.
Garden Elevation, yeah.
That night they were all going to take it into the center of it.
There you see the big thing.
The next day all of them went to the center of the worker and the first mission of then.
And then the whole world.
You see the picture of the place called Singapore Mandar -- from the time -- people are going to grow -- it's a great financial, you can see the skin at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the city of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of design, it's not about people, but of things that we use and control.
Today, we know all about the product of our objects today.
So this is a map that shows all of the kids that make a Martin, how you get them.
But we know very little about where things.
And so in this project we developed a few small steps to develop the based in their face for the system.
We started with a few of us who helped us in six more than a year ago, to figure out what they were going on, different kinds of things -- as you can see, things that are all going to be able to see.
And then we put them a little bit of a short, a stage, and then we started to make it.
These are the results of it.
So I put out of Seaten.
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of individuals in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that you don't exist.
They're going to be able to be complicated and there is a lot of transformation and there's a lot of transformation.
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at all the days that the rate that we're going to do is not designed, it's still in some place in the planet.
And if the plastic flow that we put up a day still goes there.
So if we show that to people, then we can make some change of control.
That was the reason in the project.
My colleagues of MIT College, I could tell you a lot more about design and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we looked at the beginning, which is to get on the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the city of the city of the city, which came and told us that Park and the South Europe have a beautiful treatment of the water of the water in public spaces in the audience.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, to get to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed in MIT -- in a talk, it was imagine that they have a horizontal and values, stress stages, generations that are open up and go down.
It creates like a water, with water.
If you come up with them, you can write in them, showing patterns -- images -- teachers.
And when you look at it, the color is going to be able to get up, as you see in the picture.
We asked this to the Berner Bank.
I liked a lot.
And I took a company to design the building to the end of the experience.
We call it Pakistan Park.
All the building is made of water.
There are no parents, but when you go up with you to get open to you so that you can happen.
The car is also covered of water.
And if there is a little bit of wind -- if you want to deal with the surgery, it goes down.
Or you can close the building and all of the audience despite this case, like this case.
Those days always there would be someone in the Internet, when you go down the car, someone who was there and he said, "You get the building building.
No, it's not that they have it, but that when it comes down almost all of the audience it goes down.
Here it is.
You see the people who are going to be inside what happens in.
And here I am me trying to try to try to test the feelings that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all the feelings were going to work.
That night was actually even more fun.
All children of San came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would be used to leave it, but a building that was going to be able to be able to be able to go up and you had to save it for not better.
(Another people." And for us that was very interesting because as an article -- engineers, designers are always thinking about use that people will give our design.
But then the reality.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use it.
This is a picture of the building with the physical effects of water, the water of water.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those scientists could start to fly back.
Imagine that they could have little eggs in the air and that each one had a little stage that changes of color as if it was a robot that move in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a health, like that we saw before, which is moving with others in sea.
We could be able to form this room.
A kind of physical screen like this with a normal control in two dimensions.
Or again, but in three minutes, where what it changes is the light, not the position of the surfaces.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen.
And then all of that could be a piece of oil short in which you can be able to get up, and you can see it, and you can see from very different organs.
This is the real Congress control, going down to form to form a Vilence, like before.
When you look at the light, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them control for a person.
We can have every show that comes out of people who come from people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with Robert Bang -- and the best back of the back of this today -- the star of the New York in New York and the Saturn State of Michael, to capture their movements in 3D and use them as the English for the Francisco.
So here we can see Robert control.
On the left look at the surfaces, the common in different solutions.
This is so much 3D distribution in real time as a movement of movement.
It can recognize all the movement.
You can remember all the way.
And once we have the specialists we can play with them, with the color and the movement and the relationship and the relationship.
We want to use this as a possible power for the Francisco.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
This is something for the New York Earths of London in London in London,
It's called the War.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could be able to send people to do something and change our environment -- as a crisis crisis, like the grandmother control, but with a grand.
Imagine that we could be able to make it a little bit for a special.
And I think the thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world to the digital world.
We have developed all, like knowledge and it's access to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the field of Obama showed us -- we can get out of the digital world, from the power of the networks -- the physical world.
In our case, this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a signal.
That means something built in a city.
But it can be to take the challenges of today, think about climate change or the Christmas experiences -- how will the digital world get the digital world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the physical world to the
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The robot is a business, again, again, made out of the same way that the real robot is a particular business.
And those particles are water, while in our business are supported.
This is a physical structure in London, but it goes out of specialist.
You can move through it, having different experience.
You can see from the bottom -- to be able to share the main moment of the Earth Earth Earth and even more, and it can use as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical boat of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new time of London.
You can go out there.
And as if it was a new piece of digital paradigm in night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the air.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are you?
They know that I would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes -- they could improve the memory -- for a more likely and more quickly.
Or maybe I would like to be in the better way, to be more likely to have more resources.
Would you like to be more advanced and seconds of themselves.
What about living more health health?
Or maybe they're all of those people who always wanted to be more creative to me.
What else would you like to love it?
So what would you like to do if you could get something for it?

How many people are going to make the creativity?
Let me look at the hand. Let me see.
Perhaps. You probably had a number of people who are creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you get the medication?
A few more.
And the state state state?
A little bit less.
What about the language?
Oh, most of them makes me feel very well as a medical thing.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible.
The evolution has been a picture here in the TED Congress, but today I want to give you the view of a doctor about the system.
The great generation of the 20th century, TV, the Stage College, which has been able to break in the National National Audience: I wrote an anti-consciousness state in biology has sense to the light.
But if you finally open the biological evolution to consider this, it's just about the past, or the future?
Is the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this rain, well in a example, it is, of course, the most interesting.
We describe from a common ancestor with the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
In the innovation has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of humans.
Some of them have gone back and go back.
We have been here a few years old.
It could seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in their most basic machine of our cells is more or less the same thing.
Do you realize that we can add and control the machine of a common bacteria to produce the product of human industry that is used to treat the dialogue?
This is not like the human institution, but it is the same project, which is completely investigating, which comes out of the professor.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all get in the most bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body.
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, you think of -- when Andrew Darwin gives you the anti-relationship -- think about the bacteria?
The interaction is a wonderful environment for those bacteria back.
It's clearly, healthy, healthy, it's very adversity.
And we're going to ask you all the numbers that you can want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to do with their parts.
It really is like a quick thing for the bacteria with the extra interview of some of them in front of the subject in the room.
But then we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help us make the social neurons, and they protect us from certain disease.
But what does the future?
Are we in a kind of evolution as a species?
Or designed to become something different, something maybe better access to the environment?
In this room survival of the universe -- life in Earth is like a big one, the animal one, as a single one, and only a single human life, and the human life, a little amount of thank you.
That was us.
And it was also the main part of this talk so I hope that they have been destroyed.
When I came back to the universe I had my first kind of biology as well.
I was familiar by the biology and the beauty of biology of biology
I love from the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the college organisms -- every single cell of the life, and all the genetic energy of that cell is brought to the two young cells.
But when you look at the traditional organisms that things start to change.
It was going to be in the sex resource.
And something very important -- with the survival of the sex resource that happens the genome -- the rest of the body is going to become present.
In fact, you could say that the influence of the death of the body is in evolution in the same moment of sexual environment.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student I thought, well, sex, sex by sex -- it seemed pretty much reason at that time, but with every year that I was going on, every time I had more positions.
I came to understand the feelings of George Bang, which still happened in the lives well in their 90 years.
And one night, somebody goes up to his own horizon.
He open the door up.
And I found it to him a bit of a radio short shoes of robot.
I looked at it, and he says, "You see a sense of sex sea.
"It's good, he says Google, I put the surgery."
I realized as a doctor -- that I was working by a different goal at the goal of evolution -- not necessarily control, just different.
I was trying to present the body.
I wanted us to make us help.
I wanted to reduce the health in disease.
I wanted we to live more and more health and more health.
The evolution is going to take the genome to the next generation to the next generation to the next generation of generation after generation
From a single point of green view and I are like the resources of resources that are designed to send the genetic cell to the next level of the original level and then let me go back to the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Arthur Arts Walk when he said, "I don't want to make the information through my work.
I want to make it down.
The evolution doesn't necessarily need to the language.
It doesn't necessarily need to the biggest or the biggest or the faster and the faster and not even to the more intelligence.
The favorite evolution to the best access to their environment.
That's the only test of solar and success.
In the bottom of the ocean in the ocean of the ocean that you can survive to the care of the families that will produce -- if there were fish there -- I found it up to the value, yet have been able to do that a subject environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what is happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular -- if we look at it, to the face next next next -- I would say there's a lot of possible.
The first is that we don't evolved it.
We've got a kind of balloon.
And the result of it would be that it was in the first place, in the first place, in the first place, we have been able to show a lot of genes that in another way would have been developed and freedom of the population.
And in second place, as a species -- we have connected our environment for us to get up to us as we get to him.
And by the way, we die -- we carry, and we're going to get so much that it's already not possible to have the entire needs for the evolution to happen.
A second possibility is that it made an evolution of the traditional kind of traditional type of nature, and it goes through the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the business of the evolution of the evolution is survival, but they're experience.
And in the end, when I kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a species we are going to have the air and changes that can produce the evolution in natural ways.
But there is a third possibility -- an amazing possibility and antibiotics and the stage.
The neuron called the neurons -- the new evolution -- which is not just natural -- but he was going up and started for us as individuals in the decisions that we will do.
Now, how could it happen this?
How could we be able to do this?
We first consider the reality that a lot of people today, in some culture -- are taking decisions about their development.
In some culture in some culture -- they're starting to have more valuable than women.
It's not really good for society but it's what it takes to the individual and family level.
You think that if you were able to be able to choose not just the sex of their development, but in their own body to do the genetic stages to face or predict disease.
And if we could do the genetic changes to feed the data or the Arab or reduce the risk of cancer or to engage the collection?
Do you want to do those changes in their genes?
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more possible.
The human genome project started in 99 and a half years old.
It was 24 million dollars.
At the next year of there will be first, in 2008, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three million dollars of the human genome of the human genome to the side of the 20 and a week.
I'm not going to take a lot to do a lot of the human genome for 1,000 and it will be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
You get those change.
The same technology that has produced the human industry in bacteria can be able to make sure that they are not just going to protect them from them but they are going to send it against other viruses against them.
You know, there's no experiment in the course with the value against the college against the cells of a street cell.
Can you imagine something good than the back?
That's actually today and in the future is going to be more possible.
So imagine then only two small change.
Can you change the cells of their bodies but if you could change the cells of their development?
And if you could change the species and the volunteers, or to change the volunteer and take your children a better opportunity of a more sophisticated life of a more sophisticated life -- to take the degrees, to take the democracy, to reduce the relationship of cancer control?
Who doesn't want a little bit more store?
And then that same social technology, that same death of science that can produce the changes to predict diseases that are going to allow us to be able to allow us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a better medical search.
Why don't you have the engineering of a Kenya Kenya about all if you could do it with the next generation of the World War?
Why don't you have a more fast concept that allows us to get faster and more distributed?
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be antibiotics.
And when we are in conditions to spend this to the next generation and we can apply the attacks that we wanted to have to be able to have become the evolution of before the neuroscience.
We're going to take a process that could be able to take 100 years and we can share it to 1,000 years and maybe it happens within the next 100 years.
These are exploration that their neighborhoods, or the numbers of their networks, are going to have to get to them.
Are we going to use these choices in a better society of a better society.
Or we're going to make a lot of different attacks that we want to do for some of us but not for the other?
Are we going to build a society that will be faster and more relative or more relationships and more relationships?
This is the kind of question that we're going to have to get in.
And the most profound thing about all, are we going to be able to develop the sound and survive the sound need to take these decisions out of it?
In order to do that, and before I could think about what I could think, these choices are going to stop from us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great experiment when you are about 300 feet old.
Imagine a world full of human.
Imagine a mountain doing a little bit of it, simple, simple.
So it turns out, clear, clear, something sure.
Well, I had a single thing that day. I was sitting on the 19th.
It was the only one that I could talk to you with the blood surgery.
So I looked at them, and they said, "You know, there is no problem.
The pain had seen the plane and we were not so far.
You could see Mars.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The paradigm is the worker with the Hollywood room.
So that's not the robot.
I went up with the mountains.
Imagine to be in a plane and no robots.
And then he said three words.
The three words.
He said, "We would present for the picture."
I did not have to talk more about the bottom of the back.
I could see it in your eyes.
It was true. The life was eating.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an institution.
We have this list of things to make before I showed before we wanted to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come and I didn't do it, all the close that I wanted to replace, all the experiences I've wanted to have and never had to have never had to have had never had to have had never had to have had never
And as I thought about that, I was looking at it -- I got a financial -- which is "Carnery Vilestine."
Because if the view is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to take anything in life.
And that effect, that purpose has actually changed my life.
So the second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we went up with the God George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about a lot of -- I thought I really feel a great thing.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and I have been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives me a place to me.
And I took the time that I did in things that they didn't matter with people who are important.
And I thought of my relationship with my wife with my friends, with the people.
And then as a measure in that, I decided to feed the national energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a role with my wife with me.
It's kind of wonderful.
And I don't try to have reason -- I love to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental record is going to say, "Art, 12, 12.
You see the water.
I'm saying, "Why do I go back back."
I don't want this to go up in 20 pieces as you see in those decades.
And as we went back, I had the sense of it, and I was going to die not fear of it.
It's almost as we have been prepared for it all our life.
But it was very slow.
I didn't want to go. I love my life.
And that space was made in a single thinking, which is, I just want one thing.
I was able to see my kids going to grow up.
A month later, I was in an action of my daughter -- first of all, not a lot of art artist -- still --       -- and a little bit like a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason to be the world.
In that point I understood those two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father of it.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
And I was able to get a million, not to die that day.
And I got another record, which was the possibility to look at the future and live in another way.
And you are living today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing is going on in their plane -- and please not be -- but imagine -- and how do you change it?
What is what they would do, that they still want to do because they think they're going to live for it?
How do you change their relationship and the national energy in them?
And the most important thing -- are the best parents that you know?
Thank you.
I clearly have been based in the life with many amazing projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called TED.
TED was one of the most important phones in the 1990s.
One day I came back to his house after I went back and said, "Please, I feel a bottom in the legs."
And that was the interview of the Earth.
And today TED has a total particular.
It can only use the eyes.
His work inspired in me.
I have a design of design and animals so of course, the graph is something that we look at and respond in the world of art.
And so we decided that we were going to pay Tony To Tanzania, TED, and his cause of it.
So I went up with his brother and his father and I said, "We will give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?
And his brother said, "I want to talk to anything again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he was able to communicate with me.
And I said to him, "You know, it's not that I have seen Steve Harvard, not that all of the people are going to communicate through those corrects?
And he said, "No, unless you have someone important and you have a very good sure you can't actually do it.
These devices are not accelerating for people.
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate it?
Does anybody look at the film and the market and the market?
They communicate in that way, they are taking it up with it.
I said, "That's a religion. How can it be?
So I was asked with the only desire to put a contraction and instead of that I took a contract that I didn't have the idea of how it was going to happen.
I grew up with his brother and with his father there at that point and with his father there in that point -- well, this is going to talk about, we're going to tell you a machine -- we're going to build a way, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it is risk that someone who has so much in your interest can't be able to buy it.
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called GDP "The "World Research Rockett: Which you have a technology that allows them to protect a light in any surface and then with a particular point -- they draw about that and represent the national space.
So they're going to be able to make an art like this.
All of the things that they are, they say, they're part of a collection of life.
First of all, they start with the sexual oceans -- then with the bad words, then with the bases to Bangladesh and at the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a collection of life in their own.
And so I started the journey here.
And about two years later, close to a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things on one side to another side we had done a couple of things.
One one, we took the parents of safe companies and we have a machine so that TV could communicate -- a machine like the San Harvard.
Which was great.
And in sense, it's the most fun -- I call it the Earth because I talk to the guy you get a control corner of it, and you say, "I don't know. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programs around the world literally from all the rocks of the planet, to our house.
My wife -- the children and I, we moved to the back of the fish and those hackers and programs and control and the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we did something completely specific and when we would have been able to have the cars of the walls and in their place would have been present.
But for two weeks later, we went to the top of Valley, my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called Seattle School, and you can see the development.
They are a couple of balls of subject that we built in the top of Virginia Santa Seattle -- something of collaboration and things from Hambut Department and Rose Santanish.
We took a PMS camera, we put it up on a light of LED, and now there's a device that is great -- and now there is a device that is great -- we put the graphic code -- the software is based in a big way.
And we created a device that has no limitation at the same thing.
There is no sure that he says no.
There is no hospital that I can say no.
And any person who has access today has access to design and communicate just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the TED room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that is his room.
And there were all this baby and subject during the big institution.
And after more than a year of private, two weeks of production -- two weeks of the night -- Tanzanian came back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the solar system of their life, and it's looking through the system of their life.
We put up the face so that I could see.
And we put a project on a part of the street of the hospital of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the sense is in the state.
So what we had to do was we had to break on the structure so we feel like if we were being able to deal with the graph as well.
And at the end of this he gave us an effective car, and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was going to put in seven years.
I felt like I would have been under the water and someone finally came to me and get out of there so that I could respond."
Isn't it wonderful?
In a certain way that's our war.
That's what it tells us in movement -- developed by developed.
And we have a long way to remember with this.
It's a great device -- but it's the equivalent of a Mars Marine.
Somebody with this artificial potential is a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and do it more quickly and right.
And since then we've had all kinds of record.
We've won a lot of principles.
remember, it's great, none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own.
The printers were the like, "Oh, this is fantastic."
And I went up with something about us and then, in the middle of us and then in design, the Terraine Terried us as one of the 50 percent of the 19th years of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what I ended up looking at the crazy, is that in the top of this year in the middle of the Man in the center of the Angeles is going to be a exploration called "The "Conservation in the Rockets."
And "The "seat in the "Same camps is going to have the best exploration of the Brain art article, Christians Frank, Christians, all of them are going to be there.
TED is going to be in the sound which is quite impressive.
So basically this is my idea, if you see something that is not possible to be able to make it possible.
No one of what there was in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the computer, the Mars, nothing was possible.
Do it possible -- anything in this room.
I am not programmed, I had never done anything with the collective technology, just I just found something and I used with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do all the day when we find it with something that we feel to do something that we have to do -- if it's not now, when I am not me, who is not me, who I'm not me, who I'm not me, who I'm not me, who I'm not me, who I'm not me, who I'm not me, who
Thank you.
I have spent the last few years to move in a very difficult situation and at the same time a long time.
I went to crime, hard.
I was working on a piece of care, dangerous me.
Final in terms of war and hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to start just this, fun at the beginning, something hard in the environment, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been putting in a lot of my career with the only goal of trying to try to figure out how to be able to be able to be able to be able to find out, interesting things, and with a lot of a way to be able to look at a way that you can see and access to the audience
So when I knew that I would come up here to make a TED about the world in the world and the pattern wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you can have heard -- or not, a couple of weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago at Park.
I sent some message in Facebook -- some of them in Twitter -- I went back to the rights of the name of my TED Talk.
And what was the next thing that was the next thing, "The Stage Park Prize, my TED Prize that you have no idea what it is about and continued to be able to explain in the face -- especially if I put it into the room to you or their company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good matter of medical opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDsters?
A lot.
It's a program at the way, by the way.
And so I still knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have been asked a year ago, I would not have been able to be able to be able to be able to tell you.
But in the new phenomenon that I'm working on, we looked at the world of the marketing, of the particular.
And as I said to me, I have been able to put up in amazing situation in the last few years but nothing could be able to present it, nothing as hard as something as hard or as dangerous as going to the streets with these guys with them.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Mars Park, I want to make a film that comes from the production of products -- the market and the particular, and that all of the film is financial with products of products and marketing and particular.
The film is going to call "The largest film even something."
What happens in the largest film -- is that all of them on the end of the end, in the end of the end -- it has images of market, all the time, from the environment that comes before the terror, the 19th percent.
Now this market, I call Stage State Congress.
These people are going to get up to the surface to a position to always.
And so the film is all this idea -- the story -- is the resource."
I am a responsible point -- DNA, I just say it -- it was more than factors.
It was "The position.
But we are not just going to have the face of the market in the terror but that we're going to make sure that we can make all the care that we could in the line.
Maybe we can be able to look at a shoes and become the most cool thing that you have used on.
The most cool car that you have built in the largest film that you never see in the largest field -- the best project that you have been being driven, the largest film of the largest field ever see."
Kart Katterns, the idea is then to show the markets as part of the life, to make them lose the film forest."
The goal of the whole level is transformation.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the film, in the end of the end.
And I would love the Christian to help make it happen.
Robert Final -- you know, it's because it's the first time I hear that, it's the most answer for the environment.
Rome, I don't know how far it is going to be the people to that.
KB: You have a perspective -- I don't know if "No one is a lot -- but you know how it is going to spend --  -- Did you know how to say -- Dickin Congo, how much money do you do this?
MR: A million and a half million and a half -- John Kates, I think it's going to be hard to be difficult with them but that no longer is going to be able to convince a couple of big markets.
BG: Who you know, maybe for the moment that comes out of the film we look at as a lot of language.
MR: What do you think it's going to be the answer.
State Rome" most of the answers will be not."
MR: But it will be hard to sell it, by the end or to be me?
JS: All of things.
MR: -- it means you're not quite absolutely.
So help me help me. I need help.
MK: I can help you.
MR: All right. DNA, OK.
MK: We have to think about how you make it free.
MR: Yeah, that's the challenge.
MK: We have some places where to go.
MR: I thought that "Control the cameras means we have a conversation out of microbes.
And the camera means the camera means we don't want to know anything about your film."
MR: And so it was, one for one of these companies of the suddenly developed survival.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film to it.
I was surprised me.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very excited -- I thought that the concept of particular, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible.
especially in the world today that we have in the world of new media and old media and the speed of security media -- is not the idea to tell that new version of attention that is going to take the message to the machines?
No, that's what I thought about.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a short room and that robot was this.
I didn't really have a risk.
There was no risk at all.
This would have been good.
But the problem was what this picture.
You see, when you take images of "The "The generation in Google --       This is one of the first images that they are.
I like your way to reach it, Sea Beather. No.
This was the problem -- the transformation, the background of simple or the pollution, and it was essentially destroyed or see, especially construction, which is concerned by vision or activity of information -- about all of the programmers of business -- being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about traditional in these days.
Our politicians the name -- the principle of the name -- even the Christians of the name.
But suddenly when it comes to make it really something that is really changed to it.
But why is it? Well, the traditional day --  -- like that war that still goes down.
It's a presentation.         -- like this room right now.
And it is also very straightforward.
What other things is architecture?
It takes a sense of College Congress.
That is very straightforward.
When I started talking to the companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to get a bit of a story.
We want you to get a story, but you want to tell us our story.
You see, when I was a little child and my father took me in some message -- and there is him looking at me as I used to do that, said, "Man: There are three side in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this phenomenon we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company -- a antibody who is going to help to help me -- and that's just because I met John Bang and Richard Kenya of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my body, I would have to go to the interest and go to the companies of my team with all my team.
So what I started to look at the suddenly -- that I began to realize -- is that when you start to control with companies the idea of understanding your market is a universal problem.
MR: I have friends that make big film, huge pictures and others who make small film, individuals, like me.
And my friends that make some big Harvards, graphics, they say that the reason why their films have so much success to the markets that they have.
And then my friends who make an amazing film film say, "Well, how do we be supposed to share with these big films, graphics of Hollywood?
And the film is called "The largest film never solve."
How are we going to see especially in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my battle, you see the British British.
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "It's good for this intervention?
Are you ready to see you a little bit.
I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you have a little bit of a little bit of this before I was affected."
And there would be one of these great factors.
The Philip "Every Park as "Step of Parka, are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man as a woman to work, sometimes, back to back, as it is.
That's the general view of it.
Now I can tell you their questions and give you a particular view of it.
Chris Anderson: We are a small market.
So similar to the kind of smaller fish that you said, we are more well a really good market.
And so we don't have the teacher that they have other markets.
So do things like this, you know, to remember it to people is the reason that we are interested in.
MR: What words would you use to describe Brazil?
Basically it is in bacteria.
KB: That's a big question.
Woman: technology.
MR: technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put on the surgery.
Man: Let's talk about something about it, front of it.
I think that "The "dense is a great word that actually put this car in positive pollution and the surgery."
You get front of you.
How do you take a little bit more time with the better frequency, more frustration, three times more frustration.
So things like those who are going to take the benefits out there.
MR: And that is a marketing company.
What about me? What about a guy company?
I need to talk to the man in the street -- people like me, to the computers of the communities.
They have to talk about my market.
MR: How do you design your market?
Man: My market?
I don't know.
I like the good.
woman, to go to the 1950s, particular particles at least that it is day to listen.
MR: So what is the Mars Galaxy?
George, something only -- "Oh, I guess the kind of gentleman, I guess the kind of genome, the stage that I have would be like a heart care.
I like a lot of the dark colors -- many grandmothers and things like this.
And so you can get access to access as a surgery of sun or I like the criminals and similar and simple.
Woman: If God was a market could be a class company, Mars Berkeley.
Man: The market that I am -- I call it called "a class call.
Woman two, in a point, in part of the street, in part of Brazil, I don't know.
Man: I'm the kind of markets.
It will be able to be able to move in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my market.
In my little secret -- that's my market.
Man: My market is France because I found the market.
Man: Man written from fishermen.
Is it that?
Audience: I'm a market market.
That's Tim. I'm Tanzie.
MR: Well, we don't all be able to be able to be Mars, but at least I got in the interaction of the "digital "digital and come up."
I realized I needed a experience.
I needed somebody who could get in my head, someone who could help us understand what they call the "police person."
And I found a company called "The Olice Bank in Parks.
They told them to companies like one, Palestinian, Harvard to figure out that matter of market.
If you could do it for them, they could just do it for me.
Audience: So I tried the picture, right?
MR: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
E: So when a little bit of how you relationship with your thoughts and feel your way to be.
MR: These people model my way to see the world.
E: How about that world.
MR: That world? I think your world is the world in which you live -- as people who go down, your family, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
And all of those things come together and start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family.
E: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MR: The next is the best day of my life?
E: How do you relationship this with your thinking, feel and your way to be?
MR: It's like who I want to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the warming things. I like the water things.
E: How do you get to do that?
What is the machine? What does it mean to you now?
Why is it important to figure out what the right?
So when a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you are.
So what else have you come from?
It doesn't have to be afraid of it. What kind of mountain are you?
MR: Okay.
E: Thank you for your patient -- Big work."
MR: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come from this.
There was a lot of light in all this.
Law Bank, the first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different side, but you know, in your mathematicians -- the Mars Mars San Park is a conscious market.
They get very good together.
And I think there is almost a paradigm in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong dots or in the other instead of getting in both of them.
A lot of companies understand -- and it is the human nature -- and it's the human nature -- to take the fear of the fear -- they get the fear -- and you actually give you a collaboration and you make you see something positive for you, and it is a thing to see that.
So what else is that?
The first here is the class, Australia.
And you can see also here to Tasmania, Wall, Michael Medical and Jernaland.
Now there are climate markets and markets constructed, those things that have been and come out and come out and come up with a very powerful market.
MR: A climate market. What's your market?
So if someone asked you to develop your identity of market, your personal perspective, what would be going to be?
Are you a street artist? You're somebody who makes the flow flow for the flow for the flower?
Or are you more well a strange stage?
A little bit more carefully, survival, control?
The adventure architects are kind of like being used to be a plant like the Prize, control, and advanced or authority like Europe Bank, fast or grade, profit, marketing, marketing or market like Galama.
Or are you more a strange of architecture desperate?
Are you connected as a 21st percent?
You're started, transportation, program, protected with Alexanders?
You are controlled, strange, family, short, seriously, seriously, or know, like the Lady Lake or Earth?
In the treatment of this film we had more than 500 companies and survival, that they said, "No, they didn't want to form part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, particularly because they wouldn't have control of the final product of the end.
They allowed us to tell us the story of the national story, and we got to tell the story in this film of how it is now using the magic result to identify the center of the wish in the brain so much for the collective market as a character.
And we went to San Park where they have given the ability to the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there are no care, there is no cars, no values.
And we went to the school distances that companies are doing in the schools with the school problems in the United States.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or that I've had more success are those where I've interact with things right now.
And that is what they did these markets.
They went to the infrastructure, they went to the individuals, and they said, maybe these bees don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat it directly with the art.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have it? They had something?
Well, since the film is going to be in the State of Steven Steven, we have a video.
I know the film is going to be in English, and since then -- and this is not all -- we've had 100 million companies in the media for this line.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half weeks old.
That's just on the line -- no present, no TV.
The film is still not distributed.
It's still not at all. It's not at all.
It has not even been presented in other countries.
In the last time, this film has already been starting to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make sure that it has been starting to make surface.
And it's not bad because almost all the effects that we talk to is to get them to their colleagues not to be true.
I've always believed that if you go up, if you take risks, if you take risk -- that in those risk there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people from that is getting to the factory.
I think when you go into your sharks in the risk of the risk is to spread all their company to be able to be able to be able to get out of resources.
I feel what it has to happen to do is that we have to feed people to restreace them.
We have to feed the people that I don't have fear of the opportunities that you can do it.
In the last instrument, I think, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We have to put it to that thing in a room.
We open the fear. We open the risk out.
On a face at the time, we have to get the risk out.
And in fact, we have to be able to deal with transformation.
Today, more than never a little bit, it's going to remember a long way.
And he said this, with horrible and transformative, all my talk to the Trade -- it has been presented by my good friends of Palestinian who were for 1874 who were the rights of the name in Park.
PM: It becomes big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
And I provided the "Every Trade "The Trade."
Thank you very much.
Steve Collen: So, Mars, in the name of transportation, which happened exactly with those 750.
MR: It's a extraordinary question.
And in my boat I have a computer at the name of the TED organization of TED, the Francisco French, a control for 1850 to be able to be able to my attention for the next year.
The idea behind the South American galaxy is actually very simple.
We don't want them to get the nuclear back.
Her biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the private plan of the British in North National.
The black box that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were able to make these systems that control lessons and values, we can use a lot of problems with the control.
The grandmother box are not using South States of Angeles, are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective version of Arabic in a particular office used by an engineering in order to control this black box -- then we are ready to.
This is the plan behind Steve.
We started with a Leader installation.
And the old industry to the black box -- day the control, and the nuclear program would be a market, mind meaning.
Is it easy.
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research about Steve six months ago, the purpose was completely destroyed.
The only thing that he knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the Arthur, the installation used to be a complete very clean marketing market.
It seemed to be able to do something with these black boxes, these control systems.
That was called the attention and we started an experiment where we interact our environment with Steve and we saw what it was with this.
So they had very strange things.
Steve was started like a lot of lab that I didn't like our subjects, I don't want to eat it.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experience with different subjects of sound, I realized and I thought, and I thought, this is a distributed attack.
It's completely designer."
And the infrastructure is looking at the base of the giant box if you find a specific control, and even if the program that is trying to figure out is essentially working on that place.
If not, Steve doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention -- and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what the goal is.
It could be to be -- let's say for example, an energy of the United States, or a chemical plant in Mars.
So better than we would find out the goal in the point.
And so we went up and we set out the collection of artist, and we found that I was structure in two different balls, a little bit and a big one.
And we also saw that they were very excited for people who obviously had the entire information.
You know all the points that I will take up.
I probably even know how much of the control coming out.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the Stanford in Steve is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the car is very complex ...
It's very much of all we have seen before.
So here you see a show of this collection of advance.
We are talking about about 15 billion line.
It looks pretty much to the old language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code here.
What we looked at at the beginning was called the systems of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were going to look at terrorists and terms of data and we tried to control them with the real world with the real world in the real world.
We need theory on designers that we can try or developed.
In order to get to the teachers about objects -- we remember that it is completely a living book, and it's just a value book, and it is surprised in Iraq.
You don't find several thousands of objects in that area.
It basically turned up to the nuclear power of Barry and the beginning of National Project.
And so I said to my air, "I'm going to be a list of all the experts of all the experts and energy plants between our cars."
I call them and put them into a effort to put their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it works pretty well.
So we were able to make the little digital innovation with the control of the robot.
The role is that mobile part within the control, that black object you see.
If you take the speed of this robot, it certainly can do it and even make the exploration experience.
What we also saw is that the goal of the car was to make it feel and develop in a force to come back to the engineers of the management and so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital industry looking very close to the data and their structure.
So for example, the number 18 degrees in that code -- you can't hear it.
I started to send a science of science about how these conservations are built in name and found that they are structures in what it is called a size, and every single size is a single side of the side of the side.
That had sense, there was a control.
And it was better yet.
These conservations in Iraq are discovered in 15 parts called the stages.
And guess what we found in the collection of art?
And a whole bunch of antibiotics.
So again, that was a good control.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
So there's no market, it wasn't like that.
The results have been connected after several weeks of work.
We certainly ended up in the streets and we had to go back to begin to begin with.
Even so, we found that these digital eyes were going to get a single and same object, but from different children.
The small goal is taking a size, and making the roles and transparent them, and the big electronic colleague is communicate with six sites and making values.
We are very aware about that we have figured out what it is.
It's National, and it's just National.
We don't have to make sure that other objects are coming through Steve.
So here I show you a few very interesting things that we saw -- I really got me.
There is the black box -- and you see the controls.
So what this thing is doing is to increase the values of energy for example, from the senses of private senses and the sense of violence and it would be able to, which is still coming down during the car -- with fantastic data in the airplane.
And you know, you know, or not, these pictures of flowers are presented by Steve.
It's kind of like the Hills of Hollywood where, during the robot.
Is it great.
So the idea here is obviously not just going to help the controls in the course of control of control in the control of control.
It's really much more dangerous and artificial.
The idea is to make a digital system.
We need the digital security systems where a human control could not be able to act quickly.
For example, in an energy, when the great rate of value is going to be able to give you a scale of school in a million.
And obviously this can't make a human supply.
That's where we need a digital security system.
And when they are constructed, then you can get bad things.
The plant can explore it.
And not the experiments or the solar system.
That's how it starts.
But it can be worse of it.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is general.
It doesn't have anything to see, especially with conservation, with control control.
I could work as well, for example, in an energy, or in a collective forest.
It's great.
And you don't have -- and you don't have -- which is going to design this song with a 3D train, as we saw in the case of Steve.
And you could also use cancer technology to do it.
It's the most possible.
And if you do that, with what you're going to end up with is with a mass of a mass device.
That's the conversation that we have to get in.
Unfortunately, the largest number of objects for the adventures is not in the Middle States.
It's in the United States and in Japan
All of the green areas are space with a large number of objects in it.
We have to face the consequences and better than we start to pay now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Robot, has been public in a lot of side that people who are used to be the beginning in front of this.
What is your operation?
Rome Laster, OK, really want to hear this?
Yeah. Okay.
My point is that Montana is involved, but the mouse is not India.
And the mountain behind this is the control surface.
There is a sun -- and that's the United States -- and that's the United States.
Because in the other way, our problems would be even bigger as well.
CA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to bring it up and that I give them human skills -- or another thing that makes sure that you can make it free and come back and go back to walk down.
In Benjamin Benjamin: We call these robots -- successful.
They are nothing different from something that gets on the morning, and it gives you a great force -- which is also inspired by their speed -- and he helped it, for example, to make the balloon.
It's actually the real interaction of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can be able to put it up with the universe and with some other experiments.
This is not an amazing idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on is what we're working on to talk about the American soldiers that, in average, has to take about their own paradigm of 25 miles -- and it's being able to bring it even more team.
Of course, this leads to some important creatures -- reading in the paper, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with the solid control data.
We decided to control this challenge and create a super that could help us make the thing.
Let me show you the HIV -- or Park Human Human Human.
So so with South South HIV I can spend 90 miles by a few hours.
His favorite design allows us to put them on the short and coming up with a lot of moral movements.
I think I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go up, and then I put my force and my resource.
Steve Benjamin: We are ready with our industrial space, to produce this architecture, this new exploration, this year.
Or it's a reality.
So let's go back to the sea sea states, about what I really feel at the same time.
There are 14 million people on the streets of risks, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really short care.
So we talk about something that happens with frequent, people in the global color that when they started their life -- at the age of 20 or 40 years or 40 years -- they put up against a wall and the room of robots it turns out to be their only choice.
And we also talk about the population that you see that it is very quickly.
His only question, a lot of times -- for a brain ready or some other creatures -- is the street of the risk.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their own exploration -- as I have to recognize it.
So we decided to start to write a new care about moving a whole new thing.
Let me show you the GPS that is using San Barry who has been using 1984 -- I had a ready in the global population, and as a result couldn't be able to walk for 10 years, until now.
Lady Bangladesh, thank you.
E: Let's look at our GPS, which was going on.
It has a few seconds ...
It is completely not involved in the mountains that are going to be able to see the computer in the back, here in the paper.
So here are a few bacteria that give you energy in the mountains, and in the robots, and they do it with this wind and a very natural thing.
AB: It was 24 years in the top of my life when I was a street stage in the air.
In a second, I lost all sense and all of the movement of the pillar into the down.
A long time later, a doctor will go to my room in the hospital -- and he said, "Oh, I never come back to walk."
That happened about 12 years ago.
So I went up to the last piece of hope of my be.
The technology technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to deliver it right down in some of them, and it will be able to be able to move in a hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk up, until now.
Thank you.
E: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the particles to feel and talk to you.
It's in our hands -- and we have all the potential here to change the life to the genetic future -- not just solutions, but at the way, and all of the use of the risks of risks, all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human solution.
This is a place where women have the balloon, sex sex to tell you, and the game is the order of the day, where the diversity is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the private man, or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their first.
This is the world of the street books of Congo Carrocks.
The bacteria are, together with the children, their own living living parts.
That means that we all share a common atmosphere -- an evolutionary open -- that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the kids are known by their attention.
But unfortunately, we have done too much.
But babies show us the other side of the movie.
And as the kids are discovered by big kinds of large technologies, the social society is a car of men with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very expensive society where the moral violence is still not seen.
But unfortunately, babies are the less understanding of the big ones.
They live in the devices of the control surgery, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox, a little bit of biological extraordinary and beauty -- but also the heart of the solar same virus that has been protected by decades and cause almost as many death as the first World War War work.
It is not to figure out that this device is also being able to put the surface of the bank.
And the control of care of care and the design do that you can't be able to get out and a study with the banks that are in the world, and home, we are not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence.
Who are these fish?
We know them like the simple "Seates "Come -- not the war, because they have sex and distributed and digital and discovery and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of the bank is more than the Kara Santa.
On the banks, like humans like humans, I love to play the whole whole life.
Palestinian is not just a game.
So for us and for them the game is fundamental to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the collection.
With him we learn to trust it, and we learn the rules of play.
And the game is about the creativity and the relationship and it has to do with the diversity of the diversity of interactions, diversity diversity -- diversity of behavior -- different devices.
And when you look at the blue game look at the right game same of the risk, the dance and human risk.
The game is the price that you get to us.
I don't know how you play you -- but I want to show you a couple of video videos that are just taken out of the solar environment.
First of all, it is a back game book, and I don't talk about energy.
So here we have a man and a young man in the middle of a perspective.
Look at what is doing it.
It could be the evolution of the financial or "The film of the films."
I just think that in this case, he love it, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as much as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the investment to bring the interaction to the game -- and also how the game is actually considered and present the control, and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the play.
The game is political -- you can add a lot of ways -- some of which are more transparency, imaginations, matter, maybe the place where the anti-relationship is.
And I want you to look at it, this is Fisher, a young book, which is playing with water.
I think that, as it is, sometimes we put on them, and we explore the limits of our entire world and experiment.
And this is that particular culture that makes us explain to us, to interact -- and then the experiments that we lose are the real security of creativity of creativity in creativity of it.
These are just a little show of the understanding that babies give us from our past.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to deal with a world every time more difficult than more creative and more consciousness.
The secret is that the game is the key of these care.
In other words, the game is our community of addition.
In order to act to a world that changes we have to play.
But we're going to go to the top of our brain care?
The game is not free.
The play.
For banks and humans, life is not just cross and destroy.
When it looks like the less likely to play -- you can be the moment that it is the most exciting.
And so you know, you know, we take this religion of evolution and we play together as we find the creativity and the anti-relationship and the amazing.
Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible to develop from an organization without film from the car called Rome House.
When I am not changing the poverty -- I grew up as a collection of color in a body body body.
And in our city, where the values are going to make a very complicated person -- you have to get to the site of the very hard interview to get in action.
I remember my first investment.
I was the second fly in the site -- so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But still there was a car on the other time to get to the car and figure out what our task was.
When I found the colleague, I was involved in a conversation with the program that no one of the worst days of their life.
We were at the end of a night, she was standing out on the room, under a paradigm, in the wall, developed as his house was in call it at all.
The other version that I was just going to get before I was -- we call Leonardo Lengus,  I got first to the colleague, and this asked him to go and save the pattern of the house.
The parent." I was a control stage."
So there was a show or a subject of money that for the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that in a building in a building in a building to save a living living only because I get it for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The color made me a advance.
He said, "You need to go into the house.
I need to go back, and I brought it to this woman a couple of corners."
And I play it.
It was not exactly what I would expect but I went up with the films, at the end of the screen -- I went to the real resources that that car or less they had been able to get up the fire and go into the main part of a couple of careers.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a horse.
I took my head back back to the scale where I met my Arabs and the public price in the main door in the main door in the main door in the main door in the private door in the private door in the private door in the private door in the private door in the private door in the private door in the private door in the private door
We went out of the house for the house of house where I was going to wait -- his theory got a lot more attention than the me.
A few weeks later, I got a letter of the decade of the house of the house to be able to take to save their house.
The assistant that she looked at over the other thing was that someone had had a couple of careers.
And so so much in my value in Robert Hollywood like my value as a value of generations -- I am terrified with generations of generation and marketing in a mental scale but also of the action of a control and collaboration to the individual level.
And you know what I've learning.
It all has its important.
So when I look at this room to people who have gone up, or they're going to be able to be able to tell you about this, I don't want to tell you this: I don't expect it.
They don't want to take the first million to make the difference in the life.
If you have something to give it right now.
They see food in a company, and you take a part of the science.
They are mental.
Not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to be able to interact the life of somebody else.
So you get into the game -- you get the cars.
Thank you.
Bill God, Mars, Mars, go back.
Mars Lensers, thank you.
And this can look like this, but I'm a big legal flag of the control.
The first set of color was made in 187 with a very simple idea with a very simple idea of a half of a life that you find between each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building in the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things than us, as buildings or gentlemen, a ball at the time.
In fact, these bacteria have become the pills of our time.
It's almost a control of years later, in 1988, to LED was going on.
It was called a complete advanced stage.
And in a few years, the Bander boats came to every home.
It is supposed to be made more than 400 billion or 75 miles per person in the planet.
You don't have to be an engineering to build beautiful body, buildings or home.
LED made it possible.
LED was just able to take the college of the control, the family in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our picture.
As so much, exactly that same year, in the Babbal lab -- the next revolution was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
The traditional was a small amount of plastic that would take us from a world of strange stress states a few to a world where everything was interesting.
And as the control of control, the transportation allows us to create a lot of more and more complex and more complex -- a ball at the time.
But there is a major difference -- the transportation was just for experience.
I don't care about it, that the growth of building our time are responded to the experience, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was in the Middle East, I started to explore the idea of taking the power to the hands of the anti-consumers and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop Linkers.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Like Lindolla are expensive millions of each one with a specific work.
They are present to be light, sounds and sensors.
And the best thing about all of you is that they are going to go up with manufacturing.
So you can't be able to be able to put it up.
The bacteria have a kind of collective.
The green is the surgery, the blue is the room, the robot is the inside and the collective color is the food.
So you just have to take a blue base with a green and very quickly you can start to make a little bit of a little bit.
A blue thing with you can see light.
We can put a battery in the middle and so on.
If we change the boat for a piece of particles, which is here, and now we have an interesting light.
We took this system to create more impact and we have a radio machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game -- Liberia are actually very powerful reality.
Instead of having to protect and solve and soldier, Linds allow us to program using very simple interactions.
In order to make more fast or more light, you just take this bacteria that makes it faster or more light.
The idea behind Library is that it is a growing collection.
So we want all of the institutions in the world to get down to the streets to use.
Like, sure, sounds, surgery, surgery, everything must be access to it.
We have given the children to see them with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electricity of every day you don't learn in school.
For example, how it works a light of night, or why the door of a subject gets open -- or how a control answer to the top.
We also have been taken to the design.
So for example, the designers without experience some of them are starting to play with Library as a material thing.
So here you can see, with paper backs and school, we have George to create it.
(Music:     A few weeks ago, we took Linds to the designers of the December of Republic School School, which you don't have any experience in English -- it's just a course and painting and we said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done -- a lot of an active control for movement.
But hope, here is my favorite project.
This is a long thing that has fear of the heart.
So for these non-stage, Library became another material -- the electricity became another matter.
And we want this material to be the stage of all.
So Leanness has an open concept.
You can be able to be able to be able to be able to bring all the design resources and make them.
We want to take a world of creativity, research and colleagues because this world in which we live -- this world in which we live -- this is us.
So I went back and invented.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the defense development.
I work in the industry of solar technology.
And my little company is looking to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to send it into the medical media.
It was designed by discussion.
This is a little video of what we do.
Man.
You can take a little bit of a control.
We can be able to get a better look at the video to one side.
No.
This is not it.
All right.
The solar technology is.
Oh, you know, I took the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
So a couple of years ago, a couple of years ago I had a couple of years ago to get the best designers and work for a year and work in an environment that represents almost all of the thing that you supposed to do, we asked them to work in the government.
The industry is called "The "Even "for American and it would be like a few of Pakistan Canada for techniques.
We had a few members every year, and we put them to work with the markets.
Instead of giving them to the third world we put them into the global world.
They did big applications, they worked with the marketing control.
His task is going to show the possibility of the current technology.
You know about it.
It's a market of the city of Bangladesh.
So here it looks like if I would look at a day, but what you really look at is that somebody else is when it comes up with the network because you know that it's not very good going to be able to be able to be able to go up by a million dollars.
How did I have to ask it to help this way so strange?
The last year in Brazil we had a team of "Path for America.
They were there in fish and at that time I was a long last year.
And they realized that the city would never have the city to never care about.
But one of the members called Earth Michael noticed something else -- that the citizens are coming up with paradigms right in front of them.
So it did like any good program, developed a application.
It is an amazing line where you can be able to make a market.
And you also have to figure out when it comes in.
In fact, you put a name on this case in this case I put it.
If you don't do it, someone can go down.
Or it has a global company.
It is a modern application.
Maybe it is the most small thing in the last year.
But it does something that any other technology of the government.
And it goes up in a living way.
And a responsibility of systems in the city of Hollywood to see this application was realized that I could use it -- not to be able to use it, but so that the citizens are going to be survival seasons.
It is very important that they work these stages of terrorism, but people go through the batteries.
So I asked the citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens go through the colleagues of the devices.
And China was just going to put it to do that to make people grow up to make sure when it comes in.
So now we know about new cities that plan to use it.
And this has been discussing with no African and natural way.
If you know a little bit about a bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software of software is a couple of years old.
Last year, we had a team working on a project that requires three people for two months and a half months for two months and a half months for a half months and a half months ago.
It was a tool so that parents could get the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that I would have done for the normal streets would have taken at least two years and a few million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in the collective power of California that until the moment has taken 200 million dollars and not work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
And so an approach that was program in a couple of days, and it is discussing in life is a kind of risk of architecture to the government.
It sounds to the better ways of working -- not like the private companies like a lot of people think it should be.
It's not like a technology, but more like the Internet.
I mean, without responsibility, you can be able to open and generation.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this approach is that it represents the way to deal with the question of the government that has the new generation -- not like a problem of an amazing information, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools so we work together with effective.
And it's not just "for American for America, but there are hundreds of people all over the country that they control with collective applications every day in their own community.
They have not been given with the government.
They feel a great fraction to that, but they don't get up, you get it.
And this people know something that we have lost of view.
And that is that if we look at the feeling of policy, the film in the Phosphere -- and all of those other things that put us, the government is, in fact, in special words in Mars Oliver, and what we do together because we are only not completely."
Now, a lot of people have taken the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to recognize it, because things are changing it.
It doesn't change the government -- the government is.
And because the government in the last one of us, they remember that of "The "the people -- the world of thinking about the way to make the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government is going to take people in order to make sure that it was controlled.
Well, after two years I've come to the concept that the government is, about all, a lot of careers.
This is the center of services and information.
This is the place that you take the call if you take 32 in the United States.
I used this called this.
I start in the back of the original knowledge.
I didn't find anything. I started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Oh, you can open the door out of the house -- put a good thing and see if you get it?
And it works. So it works.
But that wasn't the end of the careers.
Bob doesn't have a call of called called.
It has a application, and it has a motivation, called "The Consequence Congress."
We don't make that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the New York University of New York Medical.
One day, this was really going to be a sense, "Sancell in my shortcut. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it to get it?
The distribution of "The Consequence is different.
Steve was talking about person.
In Consequence Congress everything is public -- so you can all see this.
In this case, I saw it a technology.
The next one said, "I'm going to go up to the place, I found the back in the house.
Audience?
I went back to the course. I went home.
Good nights, she spends a character."
pretty simple.
This is great. It's the control of the digital and the physical thing.
And it is also a great example of the government of the government to the value of the grandmother control.
But it's also a great example of government as a photograph.
And here I don't need to get to me to the technology technology of paper.
I talk about a platform for people to help them and help others.
So, a city helped other but the government had a key paper.
They met the two people.
And I could have been connected with the government services of being necessary but the technology is a better anti-activity and more rather than the government services that the generations are.
When a network helps others, we get the community.
If we call an animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about government is that it's not the same thing that the policy is.
A lot of people understand it, but you think one is the inside of the other.
And that our inside of the government system is the video.
How many times have I led to a political leaders sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political language, and then we hope that the government gets our values and survival our needs.
And that is because the government is like an amazing ocean and the policy is the surface of 15 feet.
That's what we call the control.
And we say that word with a lot of design.
But this is what it means to us that you know that that we think of that as something that happens as something that happens in our against against -- that other thing, and in control we're losing the power.
People believe that politics is great.
If we want this information to have to have to have to make it feel to make sure that the control is sensitive.
Because this is where the real work of government is.
We have to deal with the government machine.
That makes the Mars Monterey.
Have you seen them.
This is a group of cities that have written a very high member of 3D principles in response to the Pole of the TED -- on the program of the financial program.
That is not political activity -- it's activity activity.
And for the ones that we have given up to the government, it's time that we ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to get in.
Do you really believe that we have to go to where we have to go out of the information that can act in the name of all of all of us.
We can't be able to go out of government -- we need to be more effective to be more effective to be.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to reduce the function of the government so that I can explore to the civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and know that it's not so hard to open down, you just have to open the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 24 years and so I mean, I'm a great generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grew up taking the word and giving that almost by sense.
They're not going to give you that bacteria that we're all going to talk about who is going to talk about, they're all going to talk about.
You can explore their choices in any side at the same time and they do.
So when you face the problem of the government doesn't matter a lot of to get their voices out.
They're using the hands.
They put hands to the work to protect applications that do better than the government.
And those adults allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be controlled by a market, looking at a market, coming up a piece of bank that has a care of it.
From then, we were always able to have taken up those hands and a lot of people do.
But these choices are like digital resources that we are not just construction, not only are we not only aware of government that we put together and we get services to us.
We are more than that, we are city.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the city.
So I want to ask all of the presentations, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us, will we be a market market, or we're also going to be a market molecule?
Thank you.
This is for me a real horse.
I have spent most of the time in crazy, professionals and in the contraction of death.
I've spent most of my life in marketing communities in projects and places where there are a lot of designers.
And I'm going to be here in TED looking at and sent up these students I've given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I have noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity in this.
And the things that are saying here are impact around the world.
And in fact, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that didn't have any other way.
I say this because I think the identity is really important.
So here we have seen a fantastic principle.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you think about sense, you can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things -- if it's collective, it can make a lot more.
And so I want to talk about the power of identity of it.
I didn't actually learned this in the protection of the right, my work.
I learned from my grandmother from it.
I grew up in a traditional house of an American family.
It was hard -- it was a strong thing.
It was the last word in the family.
She started a lot of the doctors in our home.
It was a story of people who had been survival.
Their parents were born in the school in the 1970s.
She was born about 1984 and his experience with the scale is the way you see the world.
She was right, but it was also love.
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she was going to me, and I had a good artist.
I was so strong that I could just be able to answer and then survived me.
One or two hours later, I was going to look at me, and I was told and said, "Well, I still feel my grandmother?
And if I said that no, I was going to take me back back and if I told me that yes, I was going to take it up.
I had this human quality that I did always want to be about it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the less than 10 percent.
And in fact, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to take his time and his attention.
My first ones were running around all the time.
I remember when I was eight  nine years old, I went to a morning, I went to the room, and there were all of my first one.
My grandmother was the other side of the room and I looked at me.
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And so he looked at it, and she was going to look at it, but she was very simple.
After 15 to 20 minutes later, she took up the room, and he took me out of the hand and he said, "You see Britain.
I remember this as if it was going to happen.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and he said to me, "Well, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you anyone."
I said, "It's good, Man."
She said, "You know what I don't do it." I said, "Oh "Arm.
And then I sat up, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I have been seeing.
And I said, "I think you're species.
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I want you to give me three things, Britain.
I said, "You know, Man."
And he said, "You know, the first thing I want you to do is that I would always want you to want your mother."
And I said, "It's my sample, and you have to protect that I would always be able to provide the care."
As I went to my mother, I said, "Yes, Mars, so I would do it."
And then he said, "The second thing I want to ask me is that I would always do the right thing if the right thing is differently.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, Mars.
Then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I would never be a complete character."
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Mars, so I would do it."
I grew up in the field -- in the rural surgery, I have a huge year and a year a year a year.
When I was 14  15 -- one day my brother came home with a piece of six cents -- I don't know where the shoes, I would take me to my brother and to me, and we went to the future.
We just got to be doing the light parts.
He took a serious season, I went back to my sister -- she took a little bit and I got me to me.
I said, "No, no, no, you know, but I'm not going to take control."
My brother said, "I'm going to do it. And you always do the same thing we do.
I took something -- your sister also took a center."
I said, "No, I didn't feel good. You can still."
And then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What do you bring your career a center."
I key the look at the forest and he said, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with Man."
I said, "But what are you talking about.
He said, "Man tells all the neighborhoods that are species.
I was discovered.
I have to add something to you.
I'm going to tell you something you probably shouldn't say.
I know that this is going to be able to disappear.
But I have 14 years and I can tell you that I've never taken a character of care.
I don't say that it is a video -- I say for the power that has the idea.
When we created the right kind of idea, we say things that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think I think my national grandmother believed that all of their girls were special with.
My grandmother had been present during the professional.
And my markets died from heart diseases with the carbon.
And these were the things that the things that we had to do is we had to make them.
Now, trying to talk about our personal system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
And in 2010, there were 300 professors.
There are 12 million dollars.
In the United States we have the biggest rate of the world.
We have seven million people in the control freedom of control.
And this mass company, in my mind, has changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities -- it will find so much designer, so deeply destroyed by these fact.
One of three black neurons between the 18 and 30 years is in the crisis or in the middle of control.
In the urban communities around the country, the Arabs, Bangladesh, Bangladesh, Barry, 200 to 60 to 60 percent of color people are in the crisis or in the middle of control.
Our system is not just designed in front of the heart, it's also about the poverty.
In this country we have a complex system that is a lot better if you're rich and collaboration, that if you're poor and engineering.
It's not concerned, but it turns out what the results.
And it looks like we feel very transformative.
The policy of fear and the future makes us believe that these are not problems.
We're developed.
It looks interesting.
We are looking at our work -- some of them are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at a lot of current.
In my state in Ladi, like in the other state -- you can make you the rights for always if you have a particular contract.
Right now in Ladi, 80 percent of the black population has lost the right at the time.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the average level of rights will be as fast as it was before it was before the law of the right at the time.
So we have this simple security.
I mean children.
Many of my colleagues are very young people.
United States is the only country in the world where they sit to children from 18 years to die in private.
We have in this particular country for children -- no possibility to go out.
Now we're in the process of some lines.
The only country in the world.
It represents people in the middle of death.
This issue of death is interesting.
In a certain sense, have you been taught to think that the final question is, people are able to die through the construction context?
A very simple question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our idea.
There is another way to look at it, it's not about saying if people are going to die to die by the control companies -- but if we are going to kill it.
This is interesting.
The death of death in the United States is destroyed by risk.
In every nine people, it has been identify one which is experience that is experimental and freedom of the death.
And a rate of architecture, a business of every nine percent.
This is interesting.
It was not allowed to be able to be able to be able to be able to make sure if every nine percent of it would be started to write it.
But in some way we take the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our face.
It's not our face.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about reason and from this issue of if we get to kill it.
It's interesting that in my class with students about antibiotics -- I'm talking about the scale.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that I started at the end of the relationship and it goes up to the second World War work.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit.
In many communities people had fear of being listening.
It would be able to be a bit of the basis.
The threat of the theory was what their lives.
Now there are more people who are going to come to me and they say to me, "You know, Steven, you can tell the people who let the people who let me say that in our story we're going to look at the first time, after 1874.
I tell me to say, "No, say that we grew up with that?
It was the terrorist of the terrorist -- obviously, with the service and developing research and self-assembly devices.
In this country we have a distribution why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've been done.
All of the time we put up with each other.
And we created techniques and conservation.
It costs us to talk about reasons. I think it's because we are not willing to communicate with a real real process.
In South Africa, people understand that you could not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put the truth with the truth and resource.
In Robert, even before the genome had this company, but in this country we haven't done it.
And I was in Germany giving them on the death of death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers are going to be after my pressure and said, "You know that it's good likely to listen to what you say.
Audience: We don't have a death of death in Mars.
We will never be able to have this here?
The room was sitting on and a stage said, "You know, there's no way that with our story, we can never help us in the human death of human beings of human people.
It would be a construction that we are, and increased and developed, we would be able to hear people.
Remarkable about this.
So how would we sit in a world where a nation like America, put people, especially if they were in their most black game?
We could not take it.
It would be an increase.
And yet, there is this development.
And I think our identity is in dangerous.
If we don't actually worry about these things so difficult -- the positive things and wonderful things are, yet improvised.
We love innovation.
We took the technology. Let's take the creativity out.
We love the interaction.
But finally, those reality are designed by the surface, the advance, the discussion, the marketing.
In my mind, it is need to get both of those things.
We just talk about the need to have more hope to have more hope.
I think that you want to spend more time to think and talk about the poor -- the ones that will never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our be.
It's true that we have to believe in things that we haven't seen it.
So we are going to be so proud of being so relevant with the interface.
With innovation, the development comes not just about the brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are also coming through the heart of the heart.
This context of the mind with the heart is what it allows us to look at not just at the top and developed, but also in the dark and the hard thing.
Realing Harvard, the great line I talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Europe, we were in the Middle East, we had all sorts of things -- but finally what we needed was hope that we needed to be hope.
Well, that choice for the spirit is particularly in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be able to be able to be able to be able to make them.
There is no relationship with technology and design -- which allows us to be really human if we don't have the profit of the poverty to the poverty, to the exploration, to the installation, to the instrument.
Now I want to tell you that these thought these thought of a much more challenge that if we take these things.
Let's go back to it.
I had the big privilege -- being a very young back, to know Rose Parks.
These women get just just to talk about it.
And the San Carlonda, I would call me, to say, "Well, it comes to the Palestinian Park. We are going to get to talk to you.
Do you want to come and tell you about it?
I said, "I know you." I know.
And so she said, "Well, what do you do when you get them?
I said, "You know, "Stop."
So I was and I just heard them.
It was a very virtual thing.
And in one room I was there, listening to these data, and after a couple of hours -- the Park Palestine, the Palestine Pakistan came to me, and he said, "Oh, Brazil, let me tell me that this idea of the standard news.
And what you're trying to do is, you know?
And I started to give me my design.
I said, "Well, we're trying to get the instrument.
So we try to help those who have been connected to them.
So we try to build the professions and the distribution in the application of the perfect situation.
We tried to end up with the sense of life, without control control for children.
So we try to do something about it.
We try to reduce the population in the crisis.
We tried to go with the market markets.
I gave it all my best design and when I ended up looking at me and he said, "The Man market man."
And he was a really strange stage, very stranger.
At that time, the South Carlas was inspired, I put it up in the face on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very good.
I think in reality, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to find the way to give those resources, those problems -- that surprise.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I have been excited in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is used to the worst thing we have changed.
I think that's true for everybody in the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a message, it's not because it is a message.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't get it, it's not that it is a face.
Even if someone killed others, it's not that it is a man.
And so I think there is a basic diversity in the people who have to be responsible by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and no particular, in many parts of the world, I put it to poverty is not the resource.
That's not it.
I really think that in many parts of the poverty is the statistic.
And finally, I think that even though it's very digital, very beautiful -- very beautiful -- very big -- it's not going to get us to our technology, for our design, for our design or relationship or relationship.
At the end of the end of a society, it's not the way that they treat the rights, powerful and private and private and the way they treat the poor -- the pressures -- the pressures.
Because it is in this context as we started to understand real issues about what we are.
And I really feel designed. I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much.
And I think of it, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasons in a very important way.
I've been telling these kids who have been sitting with a lot of door.
I'm going to go to the crisis and I see my colleagues of 18 and 14 years old, who have been spending to be able to go up as an adults as well.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How do you get a woman to turn someone in what isn't it?
And the play would take it as a artist, but I see a child.
A very long night I was willing to think, by God, if the game can become something that you don't are, you have to have medical power.
Yeah, Brazil, the play has a medical power.
You should ask something about that.
As I was a very long thing, I couldn't think about it, but I started working in a machine.
I had a 14 years old, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
I started working in the material, with a stage that he said to me, "Music so that my black cell of 14 years is treated as a private ball of 75 years old, and I heard a context."
In the machine I had had it had been controlled in the accessible, in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a strange line about how in this country there is no supercomputer, but a whole lot of special.
On the next morning, I was trying to think about that machine that would be a dream or really written the writer?
For my wife, I didn't just have the resource, but I had seen the car.
They spent about two months, I had already heard it.
And I finally decided -- I have to go to the car for this kind of simple.
I went up to the car and I felt really risky, and I felt really risky.
I went on the car to the boat.
I thought this would be very difficult and standard.
I finally went out of the car -- I walked to the body.
I was looking at the schools when I found a black man -- it was the control of the blood.
When I looked at me, I came up and said, "What is it?
I said, "I'm a driver." He said, "It's a complete store." I told him yes.
And so I got it up and I got to me.
And I'm going to show you in the ocean.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was visible.
And that was known with me, with my identity with the capacity that we all have to control the community with a view of hope.
Well, I go into the organization room.
When I got in, the game saw me.
And he said, "Yes." Stephens, you wrote this mass molecule?
I said, "If I said, I was me." And we started designed.
People started to get out. They were all individuals.
I was the one that I had written with those cars.
They came up with the particular films -- the strangers.
As soon as you know how the room was full of people, all of us, because we talked about reasons, because we talked about poverty because we talked about device.
With the eye of the eye I was able to see the control that was and came on.
I was looking at the window and he was going to hear all that control.
I kept walking up for here and for there.
First of all, this old black car, in the room in the room and felt behind me, almost in the table of the batteries.
And about 10 minutes later, the game decided to be a surface.
And during the development of a surgery of the arm is showed up because the content had been in the room.
The airport was based on the old black one.
And he said, "Look, what do you do in the original room.
And the old black came out of it, I looked at the authority, I looked at me and said, "I'm going to look at me and said, "I think this room is to tell this young thing to keep his view in the object with the subject.
I have come back to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral art of the universe is very big -- but it goes into the structure.
So we can't be really human humans if we don't worry about human rights and for the digital.
And that our solution is living to the others.
And that our technologies of technology, design and creative and creativity have to look at the frequencies, compassion and technique.
And by the top of all, those of the questions that share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the goal with finally.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and look at an evidence from the audience of this community, from this community, to help it in your purpose to do something.
Something that is not a contract. What can we do?
BG: There are several different opportunity.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a resource in which you're going to make a force to reduce the forests that are going to be done in political politics today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on the death of death in the next five years.
And despite this, 45 percent of the cases of the hospitals are not controlled in artists.
75 percent of violence don't come to anything.
Here's an opportunity to change.
This resource is going to ask you to make these forces that are going to make the law of the law -- to the security of it.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge design in the U.S. in the United States, in the last three decades.
Some of the experiment, it tells you that it has to do with the biggest rate of control.
What would you tell you what you think is it?
BG: In fact, the rate of creatures with violence has been completely straightforward.
The great growth in this country is not because of violence with violence.
It is for the war of war.
And that's why it happens to be the definition in the collective population.
And we let us be able to convince the record of the car.
We have three basic causes to take people to the personal parents, for a little bit of a bit of the professionals, for small companies to make the programmer, instead of doing those resources to their video.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of crimes and not less.
It seems to me that our current approach is not doing anything for anything.
I think that's the organization that has to change.
CA: Basically, you have been able to put up here today.
You're very interesting.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Romo, they grow the analogies for the death of Brazil Lake.
Letter 2: Hello in Sanda Bob 3: Partian pollution died money.
Let's hear 4, California deserts.
Letter 2: So social destruction.
Letter eight -- San Elizabeth Earth, Carteria.
There are a lot of the stages, walk to the original design -- the Mars to the market.
Remarkable.
Congress.
Oh, my God.
Persion DanielY: These are just some of the cells that I got in the last six months ago, could be in the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that the media media is going to be able to give you new negative news because our minds would tell them attention to them.
And that represents a very good right.
In every second day of every day our sense will get much more data than the brain can probably protect it.
And as nothing important to us, the first part of all of those data is an ancient airplane of the technology called the analogy.
And the food is our anti-consciousness destruction, the diagnosis of the dangerous.
And it turns out all the information looking at something in the environment that I could be able to do.
And so of a tens of stories we would try to look at nature.
That old one of the present, if there is a blood, "It is very true.
And because I because all the digital devices give us national news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's not to figure out that we will be particularly.
It doesn't know that people think that the world is going to be a bad in worst in worst one.
But maybe not like that.
Maybe in change, what it really happens is that we have distributions.
Maybe the huge progress is going on in the last century for a series of forces is considered so that we have the potential to create a world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- the climate change -- the climate change of water, the water of water and energy -- we have them.
As human beings are very good to bring the problems and, at the long time, we just ended up with them.
So let's look at it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than developed, the average industry per definition is being used around the world.
And the individual mortality has been replaced 10 times.
In fact, the cost of the food -- of the electricity and communications, has been about 10 to 1,000 times.
State Park showed us that we're living the time of the history of human history.
And Charles Kenya that the world worked from 25 percent of over 80 percent in the last 150 years.
We are really living a little bit of an extraordinary time.
A lot of people have it.
And we are going to be able to give you a bit more time.
In fact, we need the meaning of poverty.
Think about this today in the United States, a lot of the people who live under the poverty of poverty have electricity -- water, bottles, teachers, medicine, motivations and cars.
The basic markets of the case of the last century, the particles of the planet.
And I'm going to take a lot of this is the technology and finally, their special growth.
My good friend Red Karl showed that any tool that goes into the technology of information in this culture -- the law of Mexico.
And so the cell that you have in the boat is a million times faster and a thousand times faster than a computer of the 1980s.
Now look at this culture.
This is the law of Mexico.
I want you to look at two things in this culture.
First of all, I know that it is, in good and bad time, in the war and in the peace -- in the way, in the destruction and in the air.
It is the result of fast computers used to build the more fast computers to build them.
It doesn't get to any of the big challenges of the big challenges of it.
And even though it's distributed in a law to the left, it goes up to the bottom.
The growth rate of technology is actually more quickly.
And in this case, at the house of Mars, there is a series of extremely powerful technologies that we today.
The computer in the body, that my friends of Australia called an industrial computer and senses and networks, the 3D conservation and their ability to deal with personal production and their ability to deal with personal production at all the planet -- biological biology -- the schools, the discussions and food, the digital medicine.
I mean, how many of you saw the violence in Japan of Wallancy, from Google?
It was painting.
And I'm going to go on the private principles that I would be.
And I love this one, "Wow I look at human organs.
Japan is not a easy game.
It takes up with the mathematicians of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the roof, available for everyone in the mobile level.
four years ago, here in TED, Rome Kate and I, we took a new college called University Carbon.
We teach these technologies to our students -- and in particular, how can you use to solve the big challenge of humanity of humanity of humanity.
And every year we asked them to take a company or a product or service, which can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can share the life of a billion people.
30 years ago, that would have been surprised.
So today we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done that you've already done.
And when I think about creating advances, it doesn't mean to create light life for each subject of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about to take that out and go back into it.
You see, the scale is control and technology is a force that would be related.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Nigeria Millennia at 1960.
He's the kind of the left.
I was invited to get the team of Santa.
The Tasmanian translators started with particles of paper -- and the same National, with college careers.
But the team of Santa, I started with care cars.
You see, the land was the most valuable metal of the planet -- it is more than the body and particular.
And so this is why the piece of the Moran part of the Middle States is food.
You see, even though the land is 86 percent of the Earth of the Earth -- it doesn't come as a paradigm money.
It's looking at the oxygen and seasons.
But then I got the electricity and made it out of the land that we use it as if it was described.
We built this attention to the future.
We think of the energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a based planet.
They come to the Earth.
It is not about school, but of activities.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of the solar energy in India is 50 percent than the generation of the generation for the desire, 185 relationships are going on.
The cost of solar energy is about 50 percent last year.
The last month last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade -- in the United States of the United States, the electricity used to be able to be able to be able to be able to share with the 15 cents of the national half of the national media.
And if we have an energy of energy we also have water.
Let's talk about the war.
Do you remember when California said to the San Space space to the Earth, in 2010, after the San State?
I got a famous picture of it. How do you call it called a factory.
"The part paint players."
Because we live in a water.
We live in a blue planet in about 80 percent water.
Yeah, 99 percent is water, the two percent is ice -- and we went through the age of the water of the world, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes up with the neuron, the nations.
In a conversation with Deliba Katrina this morning, one of the individuals of the crisis, I'd like to share with you -- I was allowed to share with you, and I was allowed to do it -- his technology called Steve -- you know, it's the size of a small shortcut.
It is able to generate a thousand dollars of water the day of any sound water -- water -- water, a leg, for less than two cents the line.
The president of Colora was just able to make a important test of hundreds of these individuals in the developing world.
If that goes out -- and I have a conservation in which it will be, California is going to be able to figure out the world in 200 countries in the planet.
This is an innovation for this technology that today.
And we have seen it in the video.
And my God, we're going to get up to 70 percent of the video in the world in the developing world in the end of India.
Think about it, that dark war has better mobile communities in the middle of Kenya.
And to tell you with a smart cell with Google -- it has access to more knowledge and information that the Colora was 15 years ago.
I live in a world of information of information and computers that no one could have been presented.
So better than that, the things that you and I have put up with tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video videos, images, biologists of books and music -- technology of a medical distribution, now they disappear and part of the market of market with motivations.
Maybe the best thing comes up when you go up with a health in health.
The last month, I had the ability to go with the Facebook Carteria called something called the Prince Prize Community -- from 10 million dollars.
We are designed to the areas of the world so that they share these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has England, you can take it, you can be able to get out of the feet.
In order to win it has to do better drugs than a traditional medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors -- where the market rate is 25 and there are 1,000 percent of health workers in the health.
When this device is a series of AIDS or DNA that I don't know, I call the health of health and in the first place, I will find out that it would happen.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world.
I call it a half billion at all.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the market of seven billion dollars.
By the way, the best practice against the definition is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people on the line -- connected on.
For 2010, it will spend about two billion dollars to five billion use of the Internet.
There are three billion minutes to never before the global conversation.
What do these people?
What would you do? What do you want to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to do it?
And instead of a economic colleague we will have the most economic impact of history.
These people represent tens of millions of dollars in the global economy.
And you get more health because of the Trade, of a better education with the United States, and because of the use of the 3D interviews and the computer in the ground will be more likely than never before.
What can you give us 30 million more members of humanity and health and products?
So what about a few times before you never have ever ever been been?
What if we give them the approaches, because they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time.
What do these 30 million dollars.
And if they are construction that we can't produce?
Something that I learned with the Prince Per is that you have a little bit of a little bit of a couple of particular partnership, you can do extraordinary things -- things that they could only do the big conditions and the governments of the government.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really makes me.
There is a program that maybe some of you already know it.
It's called Paris.
I went in the University of Washington, in Seaten.
This is a game where people can take a science science and figure out the way that it will be able to pay at the way.
The particles will stop the structure and factory.
It's something very important in the medical research.
And so far, it was a problem problem.
They have been playing with this whole college teachers between others.
And then hundreds of thousands of people came together and they started playing it.
And it has been shown that today the machine of human patterns is better than the best computer.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the great challenge of the planet.
We have the tools with this special technology.
We have the population of the biological institution.
We have the collection of the technology.
And we have 300 million new minds that are going to be used to work in the solution of big resources and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The cost of the particular point.
And as the idea can explain in a minutes, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my horses.
He was here, as you know, in 1977.
You may think it would be able to be able to put it up, but it wasn't like that.
I actually remember fish ...
And I discovered one of them as a very clear car.
It was the mind.
It was very much to the decade of 1978.
Now the fish is in the Roman Rolly of the Bang.
But we've heard this story a lot of times, on Galands and other places, so that doesn't have anything of space.
But the case is we still come to the Galands.
We still think they are protection.
You still say they still say they are going on.
So what happens here?
The second story is also another context, the control of the control.
Because I was there in 2010, studying a role in the West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could make it up.
I want a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first experience to the sun.
The paradigm was replaced of paradigms, and as you can see, of a few miles.
And there were a lot of about 20 meters.
And the fish of this relationship was very exciting and I was going through a good moment, so it would be more than the middle of Google.
When I was there 24 years after the amount of fish had gone up to half of them.
They got to the five meters.
They experience a genetic perspective.
There was even fish before.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
Or it is, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was it that I was a start in the interview of the film of the audience in the American surgery.
In the 1950s, I started in the 1990s, Europe is actually a lot of developing project.
The funding development came up to the countries that had already been 100 particles, to imagine the industrial fish form.
And this battery, quite small, it's called the Moritor 4.5 percent.
I was going to go back in it, and we made students in the state of the Mars of China -- and about everything in the Marine Marine.
And what we did is that we used to be an amazing thing.
We call it right now, the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we used to do was particles, other animals that are in the past.
And most of the fish are thousands of times on the rest of the rest of the rest of them that are full of collective control.
In fact, the bottom of the sea came to the career, and then it was wrong.
These images are extraordinary because the treatment is very quickly.
In a year, you make a study and then it starts the commercial fish of it.
And the forest is going to be a force full of collaboration in this case, in this case, to be a light.
This is a death.
They didn't get them out. They found them because they were dead.
Once we take a life.
I was still not going on.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
So this piece of rest is what you remember every time you go to a area in which they have never happened.
But it doesn't have a decade.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We took the particular point to the new level, without remember what was there.
If we got this something like this.
In the environment, we have a good thing to be good -- a lot of organs, the subject of the country, the south of water.
And that changes with time.
Every generation will use the images of their life in the beginning of their life as normal as the normal and it will take it back.
The difference is that they lose the loss of it.
But they don't lose the loss that happened before.
You can be able to look at the surprise of change.
And at the end of them to keep a little bit of it.
And that, in a big thing, is what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they are.
But you should think that this problem affect people when the professional societies will kill animals without knowing what you've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously an animal that is very exciting -- before they want to explain -- it's a little bit.
You don't make an amazing animals here.
You get a little bit of a little bit.
Even if this doesn't stay like a great thing.
With time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea sense of big fish in the time.
They become a little bit, because we found them.
And with time you get a few fish but we think that that's the point.
And the question is, why do we do this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists are very different.
And they will do it because the evidence is in a way in a way that they are not the way they would expect the evidence to do it.
So for example, the ancestor that some of them would say, as you can take a lot of fish in this area can't be used or so you can't use it or because they are not using the scientists of the fish because it's not science."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in international societies because they don't trust the source of the past.
And the huge role that can be able to make a deep market area.
Because with the market markets -- we really remember the past.
And we remember the past that people can't be able to focus because the particular point has gone up and it's just under it.
That's for the people that you can see a massive area and they can benefit from the vision that you can pay -- which allows them to take their point of particular.
And what happens with the people who can't do it because they don't have access to them, like people from the Middle States, for example.
I think there is the art and the car may be able to be able to get the value.
This is a situation of the Bang of China.
A long time ago, there were a lot of time in the back of Charles -- 500 years ago.
And you would have noticed that mathematics and the transportations are like "The "seat."
And if you think about "Steers: if you think about why people were connected with the film -- and talk about the story of Palestinians, why are you going to deal with the images?
Because it takes something that, in a certain sense, it has lost it.
And so my resource, the only one that I will say, is to California, doing "The water.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I am Katton Allend, the Telescope of YouTube Telescope -- and I look at video videos in professional ways.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the video games are doing virtual and how important it has that.
We all want to be stars -- cells, cars, cars, when I was more young -- that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the green video makes any of us, or of our actions, and we were born in a part of our global culture.
And anybody can make a famous in the Internet in a sense.
You get more than 45 hours of video to video for me.
And from that, just a little bit of a little bit of a view is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live and
How does that happen?
Three things.
Well, let's start with.
Ben Vietnames, Oh, my God, my God, my God.
God.
Good."
And I mean, good."
KB: Last year, Ben Vietnam came up with this particular video out of his house in the National National Party.
In 2010, I was seen 24 million times.
So this graph shows the teachers in the population of the world's season.
Benjamin doesn't be able to make a living video of it.
I just wanted to share a spirit three dollars.
That's what you do if it's called London Mandar Mandar.
There were a lot of video of nature.
This video had been published in energy.
So what happened here?
It was Japan Karco.
John Karcis published this guy who would lead to the video to the police.
The consequences of technologies like John Katrina would tell us new things and interesting and they get them to a more complicated public.
Rome Bank,    It's view, you have to start the virus --       You have to start the end of the week --      (Audience: You see the virus.  Chris -- I don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video.
"Listen Research Bang is one of the most popular video.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the forest of use.
At the same time I was going to be a store -- this video.
So what happened this day.
Well, it was virtually, it's true.
And if you ask for those other patients, they are also visible.
But what happened this day, this day in particular?
Well, I took it Johnson, and a lot of babies started writing about it.
Michael January, from Mars Seaten Tennala, was one of the first people in making a group about the video in Twitter at Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of techniques are going to take a point of view and share it with a more completely completely completely profit, to connect the process.
And so this community of people who share this big guy who starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10 percent parts of "The "Life in City.
So just in the first seven days, there was a position for each other days.
As a difference of the 20th century of the 20th century of the 20th century, this community is our way to be part of the phone or doing something new with that.
"The "Control "Sea is a representative animal with a marketing music.
That's what it is.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's risk, you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
So until the groups saw this video.
And there are groups who saw other groups to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I found between the Internet community of the Internet.
There was religions.
Somebody made a version to the environment.
And then it made it interesting.
Of course, I went up with a whole community of resource that did this would happen to be a control of what we all can form part of it.
Because today we don't just enjoy it, we pay.
Who could there be something like this?
Who could have provided "The "Michael "The "discovery or Rome Bank or "The "Control?
So what would you have written to have written to the situation?
In a world where you get two days of video for me, just that only only one of the only thing that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who represents against colleagues in New York -- I guess I don't care too much.
Carl National, I was asked by not controlled by the biology but often there are observations that are going to be able to be able to take it down to the biological.
KB: Thank you very much to the solar effect and his human head, Carl Nigerian has been able to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is going to be all the new thing we do in creative ways.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Ben Vietnames, what does this mean?
Allego."
KB: What does this mean?
Now, the consciousness of technology, creative creative communities -- they are totally experienced by a new kind of media -- in a new culture -- that we all have access and is the audience that you have to do is that we have the police.
As I said before, one of the world's cars in the world, John Beat, started in City.
They don't get allowed to explore their ideas.
Now we are all a little bit of our collective culture.
These are not the top of the old measure of the old media -- they are the models of the current media -- but they're going to develop the future of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a story.
It's a strange that's still going to be able to get up.
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first piece -- a man named the work of a life.
This is a police, a man, a man who was going to be put up in the hope only in the top and freedom of their country.
Imagine it as the communities go into Santa, giving the fact that their life had been completely at all.
The words -- for so many friends, now they did it.
It turned up in the situation.
It died by the story.
He is my group.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our resources.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget your story.
My task was not going to let it have been at all, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to stand up, but we keep it.
The next part of the streets is about a book at the end of the sea to the sea search.
My mother, Man, I had just 18 years when his father died and a concept and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two small girls and two little
For it, life had gone up to a street surgery, the scale of his family and a new life in America.
It was amazing for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a four years of four years that I challenge the film -- a boat is described to the sea developed street.
All the adults knew the risks knew about.
The biggest fear was the particles, violence and death.
As most of the adults, my mother took a short floor.
So if you take it, we first took it my brother and me, and then she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she and my grandmother and so she
My first resources are from that book, the religion control of the mountain, and it was survival in every car, and the sound and value and street.
I don't remember the parts that came back several times -- but that they were involved with the value of men in our ball, or the mountain died and I couldn't be able to save for six hours.
But I would remember the lights of the particular paper in the cost of Mars, and the young man that collects and a young man who was able to take the journey was too much for it, and the first piece that I tried -- because of the men of the paper.
No monkey had after the same know.
And after three months in a field of religions, we were going to do in Michael.
And the next piece of the streets is about four women over three generations giving a new life.
We are going to be able to put in Parks, a kind of kind of kind of kind of collection is full of infrastructure.
In the direction of the middle cars, how much I knew in Parks, there was no sense of the right.
The characters that they came from the rest of the world.
And the engineers of English.
My mother worked in graphics, and then in a piece of cars -- working six days, they were going to be able to be able to work on it.
Even like that, I found time to study English and get a terror in TED -- the information.
We were poverty.
All of the dollars were survey, and I was able to put a strange strategy in English and mathematics -- I didn't matter what it would be, that it was going to be a whole new way, it was always a second hand.
Two hours of media for school, one to hear the holes of the other.
A control control to the top, because I had to stop six years.
And there were high shoes and pains about the "degree "seats, and some phones: "Step them home.
home, what?
So something at me is able to get up.
I was looking at design and a voice that he said, "I'm going to do it."
My mother and my brother and I put on the same home.
My mother was extraordinary every night, but we told us about our day and we heard the movement of our grandmother in the house.
My mother sounds stage, all of the back.
And my task was to be willing until their students were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And she opened a bunch of computers -- then I study to be supermarked and open another business.
And the women come with their stories about men who couldn't do the transportation, engineered and influences, and girls and girls transformed between two world.
They were looking up and factors.
And they were created control.
And I lived in particular world.
In one, it was the collective statistical student that was going on with what it was made of myself.
In the other one, I was involved in presidential lives, transparent by violence -- the advance of drugs and the entire analogy.
But a lot of people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I took me the young audience of the year.
And I went up with a piece of a piece of the street to the other, but their boats didn't work.
And so I said, "I was in the American American network, was now so seriously, recorded and social action, invited to talk to you in places that had never heard of it, and in house how much she had never been done.
I don't know the projects that I don't know about.
I didn't know how to use the cars.
I didn't know how to talk about it.
I didn't know how to talk about nothing.
I wanted to go back to the robots and the content of life in a sub-Saharan surgeon -- a mother and two children ended up the day as they did it for almost 20 years, and you get on the day of each of each one and the short days, the three still in the same house.
And I said to my mom I couldn't do it.
I remember that I had now the same age that she had when she was when we went to the battery.
He had never been a consequence.
"Don't do that, and they don't be what they don't have there."
And so I talked about the galaxies and education and education to the devices and the devices and the devices.
And how much more I talked about, it was more enough to talk about.
I met people from all the walk of life, many of them doing what they love, living in the front of the possible.
And even though I ended up my colleague, I realized that I couldn't be able to be able to go on a correct career.
I had to have another piece of the street.
And I realized at the same time that is good to be a development, a record of the scale -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that's going to be, maybe a record of the battery.
Because it's going to be in the way that it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to apply the presentations of your private.
I gave the countries out of my content in order to know that, yes, that the world goes down, but not the way we do.
You may not have been allowed to be allowed to be analyzed.
There was an energy there, a complete antibody -- a market of humanity and value.
And so I felt my research.
It took a little group of people for who the call can't be able to do it was a research challenge for you.
For a year we didn't have a center.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant street of knew that we all share it.
We were working until the night.
Most of our ideas were light, but some biologists, and we're going to be able to.
I took the decision to make the United States.
After a single journey of it.
My career again.
Three months later I had moved up, and it was the advanced control.
Before I ended up, let me tell you about my grandmother again.
She grew up in a time where the conflict was the social note and the local Mars was the person who was important.
The life had never changed by century.
His father died a little bit after she was born.
The mother came up with it.
At the age of the 17 became a market of a Man whose mother the drug.
No support of his market, I take a record to make it and take the cause of it, and so much more back when you go down.
You can't be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
I was in the day in the course of a hospital at the side of a hospital when she died -- to six miles on Michael.
I looked through the mountain of the daughter and I saw the other side.
I knew that I had come to describe.
My mother called minutes later.
days later, we went to a terrorist terror in Paris and we sit around his side.
We tell them stories and we showed that we were still with it.
On the night a mother came up and told us that I had to close the air.
My mother asked us to take his hand.
I asked her to the monkey, "Why is his hand is careful, and the rest of the body is so fast for the body?
Because you have taken his hand from the morning, he said.
haven't been surprised."
If there is a born in our family, that happens through women.
Dad who we were and how life, we can now see that men who would have come to our lives would be freedom.
The destination would have been able to have done it.
Now I want to have my own children, and I ask me about the battery.
Who could I stop that for you?
However, I'm afraid of the impact of how easy the right.
Can I give them a product in their lives, survey value in each of the shoes, the really constructive control of the mountain, the horizontal value that not they don't want to get it?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and look at it, I would do it.
The New Netro and also the mother in so much here is here in the fourth or the film of the film.
My story starts in Rolly about two years ago.
I was in the desk, under the school school, with the surface of Michael Alexander.
We were understanding of how nothing has changed from the time of the ancient European English "The Middle."
In those days when we wanted to go back to a car and we started the sky.
Now we do it with a little bit.
And in that time when I go up, the great industrial war -- I had a shoes and I had a short and with a street to the ground, it got water.
Now we do the same thing with drugs and machine.
The concept that we knew was that the machine had gone to the machine.
And that makes me a lot.
And every time I felt a little bit more about technology.
I took this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and look at a limit if I didn't have the camera if I couldn't take my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the material, not to kill it.
And I was going to give me my grandmother painting to me in the back of the battery.
And this piece of 50 years of 50 years was for my most medical thing.
It became a particular door to a world full of images and forests and nations in my picture.
I had the sense that the levels and the legs and the camera is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it happen.
And they spend our research.
And so I took it back to me to this technology to see this technology to see how to use it to create a magic instead of doing it instead of doing it.
And I put books.
And so when I saw the audience I saw a national device that was able to connect the regions of the world.
You can know how we take the book.
where we are.
It will take the fear with the image with the picture, the sound and the top.
The nature becomes more and more morality.
But what does that mean?
I'm going to be able to pay Katterhean, an interesting approach for Palestinian.
He says, "You know your challenge about each light."
And so on.  And he says, "This box comes up to me." I wrote my name.
And so I'm going to come back to me a book.
In several times I got a car -- the Palestinian knows where I live to the DNA -- that comes back to me.
My little girl is excited with all of these impossible.
I've talked a lot a lot about it.
And I don't mean to markets and dials but at that map of the industrial -- to those ideas that we open from children.
For some reason, you will get them into a face I always found me.
So over here, we have to be able to be able to be able to deal with the control to get out of it.
And actually, they look at your way in what the book is.
Another idea that I was taken from a girl was that a whole group goes on a book.
So here, every book and every world is transform in a battery that I used to this medical device within the shoes.
And this is a map of it.
All of them have always been markets, but they have been straightforward markets.
This is a map that I grew up and you go through the rest of the book.
In certain parts of the book, it's also released.
Now I'm going to come in.
Another very important thing for me is to create an individual and the control of the time.
These of these are the warming.
And we've all heard of the houses and the neighborhoods, but how many people outside India know their own individuals, the work?
These poor poor have been applied in the cameras of India for millions, in a old and high-power meaning.
So we are trying to go back in a single industrial story.
And in a story that is about a story that is kind of kind of kind of like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environment, one of the problems in the last 10 years, has been that children have been replaced, and they have not gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can get to our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the books of the book is this advance where you have to go to the experience, to take the camera or the partner, and they will reduce images of different natural questions.
And I had a lot of colleagues, and I had a lot of colors, for the partners, shoulders and careers.
For some reason I don't do it.
So in order to reduce this relationship of influence you have to go out and in a care, to take a picture to a film and then take it.
In another room, you have to take a picture of a piece of color and then take it.
And so this is a digital color of pictures of pictures that then you can put in the world.
A child of London put a picture of a boat and says, "Oh, today I saw a character."
A child in India says, today?
And it creates this kind of social network in the face of a digital picture of digital pictures that have been taking up.
In the room of context between the material, the Earth and technology and technology is a lot of possible.
In the next book we're going to have an interaction where you go out with the Palestinian and the video of the vision and the video is actually able to see a group of us that are going to be able to look at the interest plants of the house.
In a moment the screen is full of homes.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and survive them to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are inspired with technology and the technology and technology and technology is going to get one another.
We took the energy of the sun.
We are happening to our children and ourselves to the natural world and the natural world and the natural love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you why a lot of health projects forced.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to the patients.
And one of the things that we did in the United States was to deal with a direction of the heart.
And not in a very scientific way, she took a little piece of carbon or I asked patients and I asked patients and as I knew what happens?
"How can we help it?
And we used to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone is, or maybe not all of us, but most of the health projects -- because we stop listening to it.
This is my British Bank. It's something very simple.
It has a street of understanding and standing out.
And all of the morning, I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put up the challenge to get up to 95 percent.
But it's so simple -- that every time I put up my information to Google Haiti.
And my head of care has access to him. So he can see what my own problem is not at the same time in which it needs care controller or some of that strange, but it will look at it.
But there's another thing.
As a few of you know, I have more than four seconds in Twitter.
So every morning I told me to my bacteria Bang and before I went back to my car, people start to tell you, "Right, I think you need a living street.
That's the best thing that can happen -- because it is present to help the patients used to help the patients -- because it could be used for the products, and also so that the patients are going to stop to take it out.
On the other hand, you can start to move to the people in their streets and together to develop some creative activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week will be available to be available to me.
And this little man connected to an area or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another device or another
And people might be able to be able to take their house, to take their own art, and it will be able to share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients make a position where the patients make a position and to be able to get the control of their own ball, but it can also help us to the health of health because of the challenges that we face -- like the device of the medical attention and the distribution of the market and other things.
It will be able to be able to be able to use and start with this to send the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by creating.
And one of the things we did would like to share with you with a video with a video.
We all have control control in the car.
Maybe we even have them in our cells.
We know exactly where they are the autonomous careers in Mars.
They also are all the galaxies.
And of course, we can find a quick food.
But where is the most close December to help this patient?
We asked but no one.
No one knew where to get the DNA save lives at this time.
And what we did was to do it in the British countries.
We created a World World, and we asked it to the public so you can see a Death, because you can see it, the drivers where and when it is open -- because sometimes they open up in terms of office and others are controlled.
And more than 10 dollars already were presented in the British countries.
The next step was to look at the ability for that.
And we made a application for the partner.
We created a application to Rank, actually, to find these Days.
And every time you are in the city of Mars and someone else -- you can use his iPhone, and the next weeks using their cell of Mars to find the most close TV, which can save lives.
And despite today, I would like to introduce this, not just like Daniel King, which is the name of the product -- but also like AIDS.
And we want to be able to be able to start in the global level.
We are connected to all the colleagues in the world, in other University -- so that we help us find it, working and act as a center for the Arab control around the world.
Every time you go out of rains and somebody collecting, it can be a point or someone behind you, can find it.
I also want to invite companies all over the world that they could help us go back to these DNA.
They could be services of message or people of terrorism, for example, to see if the DNA is still in their place.
For me, you're going to help you in this and not just improve the health -- but take the control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph here.
Or is it the photograph?
Because of course, they are pictures that can't take with their cameras there.
My interest on the photograph was described with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And it took me with my passion in the discovery, but it was a little bit different because when you use the camera the process was in private.
And when you take a picture with a camera the process is when it comes to the particular.
For me the photograph had more to be in the right place in the right moment in the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
And so I wanted to create something different -- a process that would start to be able to be able to put the particular.
Photos like this, a building in a very traditional career.
But it has a standard galaxy.
And despite it, it makes a level of reality.
Or pictures like this, dark and controlled to the common goal to keep the level of reality.
And when I say I really say a lot of personalities.
Because of course, it's not something that I can care about, but I always want it to be able to have been used in some way as a picture.
pictures that you will have to think about a moment to figure out the tradition.
It has more to make an idea that you can take a moment.
But what is the treatment that makes them look like real reality.
Is it the details or the context?
Do you understand the light?
What do you create the control?
Sometimes the installation is the perspective.
But at the end of it is about our way to interact the world and how it can be able to be able to stay in a biological surface.
It's actually not about whether it is real but about what we think it's really true.
And so I think the forests are very simple.
I see it as a result of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and we put them to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three important objects -- something that we all can relationship with the traditional world.
But you change in a certain way you can create something that even looks like transportation, as if there was a transportation.
But at the same time, we know they don't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't get the fact that it really doesn't have sense.
And I see the same process to change the picture.
It's really going to make different reality.
And the things that make a picture look like I think that they are those where we don't even think of the things we don't even think of in our everyday life.
But by building pictures is very important to control it, because somehow something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get real results to do this.
As you can see, these images are not very space.
But you know, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the beginning of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures have been having the same kind of light.
And these two images with these resources, they were taken to the same and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make care of the main and the end of the different images with a perfect performance.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
I could think that this is the image of a paradigm and the bottom part is market.
But this picture is completely connected by pictures of different places.
At the point I think it's more easy to create a place that will find because you don't need to put the ideas that have in the head.
But it requires a lot of private.
And as I thought this idea in send I knew that I had several months to bring it, to find the different profits for the pieces of the streets.
For example, the fish was taken in a piece of food.
The costs are from a different.
The surgery was taken in a piece of stream.
And yes, I even did red the house in the end of the island for it to look more quickly.
So to make a really real result I think that makes a little presentation.
It always starts with a battery, an idea.
Then you have to change the different picture.
And here every piece is very well thinking about it.
If you do a good job to take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful and the very real time.
All of the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination of it.
Thank you.
So I will start by showing a bit about technology, very artist.
And please if you can put it.
This is a drug that I took from a mistake me.
I'm not interested in showing you so much to show you the details but the great thing.
It is about an alternative that we were doing about the power of the GPS markets see the power of the local area.
The interesting thing about this is that, as a lot of others that we used to see, is a kind of light line in the local scale.
In other words, every step of here represents a piece of market in the scale of the resource.
And I'm going to talk about technology with genetic cars is something too.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please take the lights out.
I need more interesting because I was writing about paper.
Why do we give the technology cars in the landscape school?
The answer is that if you would put them into a normal culture in which we say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any of the time, and this would be any half of the technology that I would like to do, the direction was going to see something right.
It would be something like this.
I don't say a lot.
But if you choose -- for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a solar culture would be very excited -- we would see a real line.
But if it happens something like this, it gives a collective change.
If the technology of trying to move as fast as the mistakes -- we could take a task and will be in Tanzanian in 30 seconds.
But they don't go back to that.
There are no presentations in the history of the technology of the technology of a growth growth that every few years ago that every few years ago.
The question I want to figure out is -- looking at these extraordinary cars -- we see that they don't follow it.
It's not possible to take this change as fast as it is.
It will happen one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical typical -- I know like this until it happens something completely different or maybe doing something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I am an ambition, so I think maybe maybe something like this.
It will be like this, now we would be in the middle of a tradition of a treatment.
In this line we are in a treatment of what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask is, and ask me, is, what is that new way that the world?
What new state are the world?
The treatment seems very, very constructed if we are infected in it.
I remember that the future is happening in the year, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year.
This is a conversation where people talk about the future and we see that the future will still be the year.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has gone out, year after year, through my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
It is going to happen to be a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it will all be so different that we are doing what we're doing today is no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it could be, how it could be that treatment that we experience.
But to do that to have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and information.
Because I think the only way to understand is to take a distribution and look at things at the long time.
The time of time when I would like to do it is the time of life in Earth.
I think this picture has sense if we look at each billion years.
So we found a few billion years ago when the Earth was a great robot with a lot of changes that were going around around them.
So if you look at the way that you get in the way that these changes will give us an idea of how things happen.
And I think there are theory to start to understand the order with AIDS. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is that, at that moment, there were a few of them with all kinds of access with all kinds of chemical resources in their environment.
Some of those galaxies of advances would get a particular combination of chemical compassion that they made them make materials from the outside and so on.
And they started to disappear.
In a certain sense, those were the most primary forms of the statement of the subject of the authority.
But those robots were not living -- in the current sense, because every one of them came up with a complete resource of food.
And every time you have to make a little bit out of the challenges of the changes that they are.
And so every day was a little bit different.
In fact, the robots that in some way they would have to be better than the time to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get more change, and they were getting more chemical and they get more.
They usually live more time, they were more responsible.
It was a form of life, and it was a very simple thing, but the things were very interesting when these robots learned the treatment of architecture.
In some way that we don't understand very well these robots learned to make information.
They learned to take information, which was the resource of the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they got in this evolution without sense, a system system that allows them to figure out what they were so that they could be able to reduce it.
The amazing thing is that that school system seems to have been able to be able to be used since it was evolved by a billion years ago.
Our resource, our genes have exactly the same code -- that same system.
In fact, every living will be explored with exactly the same set of read and the same thing.
And one of the things I did only for different, we can write things with this code now.
So here I have 100 billion dollars that I try to get to the security people in the surgery.
But you know, I took this code -- the code has the cells that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this distribution of DNA and I took it 10 to 12 times.
And so if someone wants 100 million colleagues of my personal car, I have a lot for all the presentations, in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a character I would have put it in a virus and would have happened to the room.
What was the next here?
He wrote the DNA was an interesting thing.
This made these cells happy.
But then there was another big step in which things were very different and it was that these cells started to change and communicate information to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can change DNA.
And so for example, for example, I evolved the resource to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid the position and they put them together to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resources to the performance because the bacteria will be community.
This communication gave it to be able to make communities that, in a way, they were together in that, and they had a sense.
In that way they solve or they were working together, or it was that if a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community of that community they were getting more and they were familiar by evolution for evolution
And the point of infection happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they went up and decided to write the whole community of community together in a DNA.
The next step for life took other billion years old.
And in that stage we have traditional communities of many different kinds of different cells working together as a single office.
In fact, we are a marketing community.
We have a lot of cells that are no longer going on.
The cell of the skin is not going to go out with the heart of the heart.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels that the cell -- something we call an office.
The next level happened within these community.
These began to open information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than making information in community.
It's the national structure.
The neurons are the advice that produce the information that those cell communities built together.
In fact, they started to spread inside the community being the responsibility of responsibility, understanding and bring the information.
Those were the brains and the national system of those community.
And that gave them an evolutionary life.
Because at that time as an individual -- the learning was connected to the definition of an organization and not the period of the evolutionary time.
So an organization could -- for example, learn not to eat a certain surface because I knew bad and it would make the last time that I bought it.
And that could happen during the life of an organization because they had built these data of information companies that have learned for hundreds of thousands of years per year in the death of individuals that they started that surface.
And so the fact that the national system will build those information of information to make the global process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual now.
It could happen in time need to learn in time.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the treatment of the community.
So for example, the most recent version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention of it.
I have a very complicated idea a very complicated idea in the head.
I am here sitting up to you to get a few of them and sometimes build a similar idea and controlled and controlled and controlled in their head that has a concept with the me.
But we take something very complicated that we actually turn it into sound -- in social signals and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as an office.
In fact, as a humanity -- we've started to do antibiotics.
Now we go through a similar part of the mathematical organisms -- we will take our measurements of representation, protecting and information of information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The terrorist, the computer, the village of video -- the Rolly, and they are the species that we now built to make that information.
And that leads us into something much bigger and the ability to evolved more than what we did before.
Now the evolution can happen in microbes.
You saw the evolution of the University in which I put some evolution with the Consequence program.
And now we've taken the scale over time again.
The first parts of the story that I would tell you about a billion years ago every one.
The next stages, the national system and the brain, took a few million years old.
The next one, and they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is related, I know that activity is the right word to name something that causes their own risk of change.
The more change, the more quickly it.
And I think that's what we see in this exploration of the culture.
We see that the process is related.
But I give me the life design and I know that the drugs that I think to be able to be able to be able to be able to be possible without the recent individuals of the recent individuals.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to be able to be able to tell you.
I don't know that it makes every transform in that machine.
There are thousands of dollars.
Instead of that, with the designers of Delamin Mars, we think a level of architecture, we put it in the machine and the machine with that makes something that you could not be able to be able to be a lot more and more faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes I don't even understand what we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using is the evolution itself.
We put into the machine a solar process that goes up in the scale of microbes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases we can solve a program to a particular sequence of information.
So we said, "Please compare -- can you get a hundred million dollars of institutions to the street?
You could take these kinds of institutions on the way, to take all of those programs -- and take those people who are able to do?
In other words, I know what I want.
Let's say I want to give you numbers -- to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to be able to be able to get numbers.
Of course, it's a little bit likely to be a little bit more likely to be able to be able to get installations, so no one of them did it.
But one of you may be able to make two numbers in the right ocean.
And I said, "Control, you could take 10 percent of those electricity signals that better did the task?
We're going to take those and we ended up to the rest of it.
And now we represent the ones that make the numbers.
And we're going to be able to give you a process of relationship to the sex."
So let's take two programs -- which is going to be able to make children -- which is going to be an anti-consumers -- and the children are going to have the production of both of these problems.
So we have a new generation of programs of programs that had a little bit more of success.
And we say, "Why do you get the process."
Control again.
And I tried to make some drugs.
And I tried to go back with another generation with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few minutes.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that are going to make numbers in a very perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient than that I could have written to hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to take them to see how they work.
These are dark programs are profits.
But you get the control.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are trying to do it.
One time I was in a 77 percent with Mars Michael and he went up a car and he says, "I look at this.
He says, "This plane has hundreds of thousands of times that work together to get a serious village. You don't make you feel a strange?
We know that the English process doesn't work very well when they get complicated with.
So we started to stop the computers to make a different design process.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things than the normal English.
However, we don't understand from all the choices that we have.
In that sense, it goes from us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot more quickly and so I can take these programs much more quickly.
Or it is, it is related.
The thing goes faster and so I think that it looks like it looks like construction.
Because all of these technologies are related.
We are destroyed.
And we are in a single moment of the college organisms when they became markets.
We are the banks, and we can't understand what we are.
We are in the personal point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very proud of our part to think that we are the end product of evolution in evolution of education.
And I think that all of us are part of the creating of what it comes in.
But now it comes up with the back and I think I'm going to put up here before I got to me.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor -- and that's me.
And I've heard the enough time to allow me to be able to get part of my favorite face in that.
Before I treat the size of my talk, let's talk a little bit about biological.
Why isn't it?
We are close to the end of the end.
We love the biology, right?
The biology is full of amazing statistics of surprise.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to get the "the "the resources, talking about the statistics and to use it to form a great team of biology.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know that a lot of you.
It's called the area of bank.
And we talk about 300 of a bank that is 300 percent.
And that means that the white bank explored -- three of 10 times.
And that means to take the role to the field of game without being a parallel, and that anyone who tried to put it to the first basis -- it doesn't come to time, and the second thing will be saving.
There are three percent.
You know how they call a 30 in the Great Long?
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a billion balloon bank bank back in the box of 400 collection?
By the way, that is somebody who from 10 meters.
Let's take it, like the Telescope Television Bank, the last game of Lindolly Monterey in the most about 400 dollars in a religious terror.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more controlled, or maybe less increased, after what I'll tell you today.
They know that they have antibiotics and they are protected to a character that has also a collection of 400 in advances.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now you know that they live in a place and a little bit of the way that you have two and a little bit of a little bit of the factory and his family medical and his family market is going to be a care of a control whose correct control is 200 percent.
But you know what?
She is making this year.
And their cars have been 21.
This is not work.
But I'll ask you to ask you.
So what do you think is the average of a heart character or a character or a control of a subject or a strange of a magnetic organ?
1,000 very, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the whole medicine knows the parts of a good corner, of a doctor or particular.
What we do, yet is to send them to the world, and I got into the market of being perfect to me.
I would never have a robot and you try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that happens when I was in the middle of medicine.
And I was a complex statistical student of it.
Once a school in the school he said that Bill Gandhi was studying to a bank of blood stage.
Just like that.
I was working in my little design, in the resource of the National hospital of Steven Hollywood -- not far from here.
And I learned all of me.
And in my kind of adult, measurement and the work -- the relationship of each art that comes out of the forest, the digital difference and the distribution of it.
And even I even know the difference difference about how to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the
And as so much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well, I got a lot of horrible with homes.
And it comes out of the medicine of medicine with the question that if you had all of it, then you would know everything -- or the most popular -- it takes me to the whole thing, because so I was going to give me the resources.
And it works for a time, until I met the Delam Santa.
And I was responsible in a college hospital here, in touch when they went to the Delam Death at the service of the effects where I worked on.
At the time I was given to the heart service of care.
And when you get used to be able to be able to be able to be able to take that patient out.
And it will be able to make it to the rest of it.
When I saw the Delam Santa, I was coming down.
I heard a single sound survey.
And when I came up, I heard a solar sound in both of them -- what I was inspired by a heart character control.
And in these conditions the heart stop working and instead of taking the blood back to it, the blood is going to the particles, and so there are a lot of blood, and so there is hard to answer it.
And it wasn't hard to design.
I did it and I asked me to work on the treatment that I would give it.
And I gave him a market and medicine to take the pressure in your heart.
And I gave it distances, so that I could be able to be able to figure out.
And in one hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And there was when I started the first rule, I sent her home.
In fact, I got two more mistakes.
I sent her home without talking to the risk of responsibility.
I didn't take the phone and I did what I should have done, that it was called my head and put it with him to see it.
And if my head would have seen it, it would have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Maybe I did it for a good right.
Maybe I didn't want to be a result that would be a question that would be considered.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to be able to take responsibility -- that I could take from my patients without even going to be able to tell me.
The second thing that I started was worse than it was.
When you look at her house, I don't mean attention to a voice in my understanding that I said, "That's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so surprised that until I asked the performance that I was running to the San Decketro, "I think it's good if you go to your house here."
And the experiment I thought and then he said with natural techniques, "Yes, I think it will be.
I remember that as if it was going to happen.
So it was that I went up with the dark, and the administration together with the particles they took her home.
And I went back to the room.
The rest of that day, that time, I had a bad presentation in the stage.
But I felt with my work.
At the end of the day, it starts to leave the hospital and walk into the structure where my car was my car to go home. At that time I did something that I don't do before.
He went through the service of the way in the house.
And there another one, not the one that was came out of the Delam Death before, but others. I told me three words -- those three words that most of the most energy doctors of the energy markets.
And other teachers are also, but there is a position in energy and is that we look at the positive patients.
The three words are, right?
"I think of the patient that I sent up to your house, he sent up to your house.
I asked the other number of natural total.
And she goes back, with the same time of voice store.
She was good.
But it came back and at the bottom of the death.
And at the end of a hour of having come back to his house, after I was going to his house -- I was a collection and his family called the 30s, the particles were brought to the experiences with an an art price of 50 feet from Mars, which means a sound surgery.
And I was going down and I was wrong.
And the personal person is going to get all of their resources.
They gave him medicine to go up with the art question.
And they put it an artificial response.
I was connected to the microscope.
I had a member of feeling because then they were going to be able to put it up and wait against the entire hope that they would get up.
And in the two or three days, it was an evidence that I would never describe.
I had a brain game of it.
And the family came down.
And in eight or nine days, they got to what was going on.
And at the end of the day, they let me go. The Darwin Death, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say that they will never forget the name of what they want.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I got it through it and experience for it and experience for the first time that there is in our medical culture and I felt just just that sense without feeling that sense because you can't talk to your colleagues with it.
You make the fish and never more access to that.
It is that sense that I left a taught to you.
The market market that I'm talking about is that it makes us feel very bad by inside it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that sense.
And it wasn't for my box, he was a love.
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I used the things and I'm sure that I didn't make me.
And I kept doing those questions.
Why didn't I ask my bottom? Why did I look at her house here?
And in my worst time, why did you make a subject so far as well.
Why does it make a medicine?
It's a little bit of that feeling that was designed.
And I started to feel better.
And in a normal day, it came up with the sky and finally came out the sun and I asked me if I would feel better again.
And I did a treatment with the same one that if you get the forces to be perfect to not make a lot of resources, it would be able to take those times.
And so on.
I went to work.
But I went to happen.
Two years later, it was help in the power of energy in a computer hospital at the North And I got a man from 25 years with a dollar in the battery.
And I was very controlled and a lot.
And he went up here.
I was looking at his grandmother, I was a little bit.
And he took it up and I sent it into his house.
But while he goes up to the door it was going to be able to put his grandmother.
Two days later, when I came to do my character change, my father asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I did the three words, right?
Do I remember the patient that I saw by a dollar in the back?
And he came back and I didn't have a social factory.
I had a very dark approach called the collection.
You can see it in Google -- it's a influence, not from the grandmother, but it goes out of the surgery -- and that can be able to use the number of those go.
He was able to go down.
And it was able to be able to go up with the way to go up with a few days.
And I spent the same period of record and resources, then I went back and go back to work, until it happened and again, and again.
Two times in the same form of data, not definition artificial.
And it's a great effort -- especially to work in a hospital -- because it goes to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a design.
One of them, I thought I had a religious car.
It will be able to give you a radio rate -- but it turned out a collection that was getting up to the patient a certain sense in the right device and called the chief.
The other patient was with a lot.
And I put it back to respond to the resource and asked my colleagues to get it.
And then you take it up and when you take a certain sense in the right right room, I call the chief.
And both of them were concerned and they got well.
But every single case I was able to get up with me.
But I would like to tell you that it took the worst banks in the first five years of energy, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a waste.
The most significant has been for the last five years.
You know, subset and not asteroid.
And here is the problem, if I can't be able to walk and talk about my surgeons, if I can't find the video that I would tell me what really happens -- how could I share this with my colleagues?
How do I show you this so they don't get the same research?
If I go to a place like this, I wouldn't have idea of what you think of me.
When it was the last time I heard somebody talking about factory, after failure, after failure?
And of course in a willing to talk about other doctors of other doctors -- but I don't hear someone talking about their own resources.
And if I would know and my colleagues also -- that a transportation in my hospital came up with my hospital.
This is the system that we have.
The total nature of the resources.
It's the system in which there are two positions, the ones that are going to make surgeries and the ones that you can't stop and the ones that I know -- those who have the results and those who have the results that have responsibility.
And it is almost like a genetic relationship as a anti-relationship who starts to affect that person.
We have the idea that if we get out of the medicine to the people who will make resources, we will get a safe system.
But that's two problems.
In 20 years ago, I have done an personal study of bad pattern and marketing study -- I have done a personal study to learn how possible. From the first article that I wrote for the South State to my program, "The College Country, Bang Alexanders, and a black art.
And what I learned is that the risks are an extraordinary.
We work in a system where the trees are going to happen all the day, in which one of 10 percent of every 10 minutes in the hospital are actually relatively, in a system. In a system where the infrastructure institutions are every time more and more naturally, by getting closest and death.
And in this country, they die 24 cents by the research markets.
The Internet of the United States.
In both cases, it is about basic subjects, because we're not having the problem as we ought to do.
And that's what things are.
A hospital system where the knowledge is moving every two or three years, and we don't get us.
The price of the dream is involved all the time.
And we can't get out of it.
So we have any cognitive states that allow us to do a perfect story of a patient with a patient in the sky.
Now, let's take at the same patient with a pain in the shoes, and it comes up with the care of collective eyes and with the short of the college and suddenly my story is kind of specific.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot -- I don't do the things always it.
And my patients are not cars -- they don't recognize their students always in the same way.
For all of this, the risks are institutionally.
So if we take the system as they taught us, and we got to all of the programmers that are going to be, well, you will not take any one.
And with the thing that people don't want to talk about their most big cases?
In my program, "The black art -- and it's a concept to say, "This is my worst burner." I would tell you all from the paradigms to the shoes to the side of the career -- this is my worst surgery, back, back, back, "The balloon, "What are your resources? And I would take the microscope to them.
And their students would be described, they would take up the head and they were going out and they would start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to say, "Look, they don't get the same resource."
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a relative medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The average medical doctor is human -- you know how to do it, and it doesn't get out of their forests.
They share their experiences with them.
It is support for those who talk about their resources.
You take the robots out of other people not with the tried to control it, but in a love way and support so that they are all generated.
And I work in a medical culture that I recognize that human beings will make the system, and when this happens -- you make sure of time in the time.
My name is Brazil Galax.
I am a responsible medical.
I'm a human -- I am a human.
And I feel a lot of it, but I feel a lot to learn something that can transform others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me share with three personal words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we get in a week in a week.
It makes a company for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to take a average Americans -- it's about 70 to 70 percent.
It doesn't make a lot, in an research for a week to a week to a group of company.
The researchers represent the different things that are designed by these characters and the time that they were able to take a lot of relationship to those tasks.
They found that, in average, they have 1900 jobs per week.
Narrative, every work is even a lot of movies.
The half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just about 15 percent of a hour or more than his time.
Now you think about their office.
Do you know how many of you come to the car of nine minutes, and how many of a hour?
How do you take the way in which you put those decisions to do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you do those decisions in which you make those decisions
And today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems in the air, and it will get to the subject of operations.
I want to talk about the problem and about a few solutions of solution.
As I talk about this I'm going to make you a few questions and I need to know their answer.
When I make a question, as I am a security, you get the hand only if you want to take careers.
On the other way, when I make a question, if your answer is possible for a face with a paradigm.
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to talk about the problem of the operation of the operation?
Thank you.
It was going to be a picture of the University of the University of Stanford, and I found this very high level of a very, very high level, at least in that time was very solar.
It's called Democratic.
It was almost like going to a couple of fun.
There were about 25 different kinds of mortality and virtual, over 500 different kinds of faces and surgery and about 25 percent water water, and this was when we were going to take water out of it.
I would love to go to that story, but in one room I asked me, why never bought it?
This is the subject of the organization of the organization.
They had over 75 different kinds of different species, including the ones that were in the side of the military background.
Once I decided to visit the galaxy and I asked him, "I'm going to get this structure to get all these operations?
And he taught me the back forests of texts that they had all the days -- it is actually with their cameras as well.
We decided to make a little experiment with them. This is the thing.
Please.
They had 33 different things.
We put a step on the end of the store.
We put up there by six series, or about 24 different senses and we looked at two different things, first of course, where the people were willing to try to test the care?
More people were found when there was 2,000 percent -- a 60 percent that when there was only six percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a car car.
Here we find the control effect here.
The ones who were discovered when there was 24 percent of the three percent was going to buy it.
The ones that they found when there were six percent of them -- we saw 30 percent.
If we do the cars, the people had six times more likely to buy as if they found six that if they found two.
Well, to decide that we don't think we did not be able to be able to become a good thing to get the line -- but it turns out that the problem of the supermarket rate of choices are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a
We decided to say, even though this doesn't get us.
Now the size of the day, the first financial one.
I'm going to show you a study that I did with Robert Harvard, Park Katrina and William Japan, where we look at the decisions on the correspond of a million Americans of a million Americans of this country.
It was interested by looking at if the number of forces of factors are available in plants of streets to release -- the 1975 programmers, including people to save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a relationship.
We had 750 plants who were out of two, until 1900 different images.
We found that how much more it was the number of forces -- there was less political.
So if we look at the extra experiments, we see that in the plants that are getting two forests, the protection rate was 70 or more, not as high as you want to.
And in the plants that are going to get up about 60 meters.
It turns out that even if you decided to pay -- when there are more opportunities -- even in that case, there are new consequences.
So for those who decided to participate -- how much it was the number of choices -- more people were inspired by taking the action or the freedom of investment forces.
And in the time there were more opportunities -- they were more willing to invest in a market forests.
But no one of these extraordinary decisions are the ones that we are going to have to be able to deal with the future financial end.
In the early decade we have seen three major negative consequences to get more and more possible.
And the most likely thing is that they put the decision -- which is going to do that when it goes into the inside of the Internet.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in the late and in the health.
They are more likely to get less supporting things -- even though it's going to be better.
The main reason is that we were going to look at that variety of many graphics -- monitor, virtual and care, but we are not able to do the cars to be able to be able to be able to share and get out of that extraordinary experiment.
And today I want to ask you four simple techniques that we have sent up, in a way or other, in different research, so that they can be able to treat their business.
The first is, Congo.
You have heard before, but it has never been more true than today, which is more than a little bit more than today.
People are always used when I say, "Come to "Come."
They are being able to lose space in the air.
But actually what we're seeing is that if you decided to cut up, if you decided to cut up, you will get out of open resources -- there will be a body in the streets -- there will be an increase in the cars, there will be a better experience in the economy.
And when I was Park All the way about 24 different types of Harvard Sea Sea Sea Seats at the age of 10 percent.
When the Colored College College called the products for the distances that less than less they were sold -- they went up with the solutions in 75 -- two times and less controls.
And you know that the results of today, in the middle of us to get 25 products in the environment.
And in a store of Barry are getting about 100 products to you.
But the world's greater therapy in the current world is Alexander and attention only 14,000 products -- a kind of street street store.
In the world in the world, I think that one of the best examples that have heard about how to make it better than to make the opportunities -- is the professor of David Lake, the Harvard program.
All of the Higgs companies are considered to a sense of life.
You know, they really want to give you to them, they are going to give you 20 forests, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to control.
All of them are important importance."
The first thing I do is to ask the company, "The differences that are between those options.
And if you can't be able to do it, you could not do their cars."
And this later, before I started this side, I was talking to Galand.
He told me that it would be willing to offer the people from this audience -- a few revenues with all the most beautiful care in the world.
Here, a development.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give you a car if you're ready to take the source of Galama.
(Audience: Okay.
Are they not it?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a transport.
Who is ready for that box?
I think it actually took more hands.
All right.
In reality, you had more information in the first room, which in the second, but I can be able to tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
And this brings me to the second news to make the problem of the operating survey that is Congress.
So for people to understand the differences between opportunities -- they have to understand the conditions of each other, and the conditions have to be a very green way to be a very green way.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more in average when you use double corresponds or control, which when I use effect?
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out that it would be more real -- it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with San Bendon and San Prize, on Penns Project, which would work in AIDS, these people were in a meeting where they were connected to a 200 percent.
At that point, that we were able to get exactly a little bit as a little store.
And what we did was that we went to the people who would think about the positive things that they would have in their lives if they had more money.
So with this minute there was an increase in the arms of 20 and an increase in the amount that they were interested in save or in what they wanted to do is they want to put up in their sounds of streets, from four percent.
The third news is Colora.
We can be able to make a lot more care than operations.
So for example, this is a study that we did in a short school.
And we saw that in the Arab surveys at the top of the contract, the resource of religions can get from 33 different types to 32.
But you know?
Because the relationship is going to give me how to do it.
These are two strangers of taxas.
One is called "The "The "States, and the other, "Stage."
If you think about the left of the left is Steve and the right of the right is Japan, they have a paradigm.
(Mom stage." Well, there are some one.
If you think about the left of the left is Japan and the right of the right is Steve, they have a paradigm.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The left is Japan and the right of the right is Steve. But you know what?
This concept is completely incredible.
The cars have to give you something to the discovery, not the ones that I disappear.
So often you see this problem with those huge list of forests.
You just like who are they done?
My car care, Congress the computer.
It turns out that we can make a lot more information than what we think, if we just took it a little bit.
We have to increase the big complexity of it.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean to say.
Let's look at a good decision -- the company of a car.
This is a factory advance of cars that allow it to be able to be able to put it up with it.
You have to take 60 decisions to bring up the car.
And these decisions are going to go in the number of choices that offer each one.
Consequences, collective experience of the car -- I have 55 possibility particles.
Most of the changes of changes -- four opportunities.
So what I'm going to do is to make the order that they are going to make the decision.
So half of them are going to go out of a lot of opportunities -- 55 colleagues -- for a few of them in a few of them.
The other half of the cars are going to go out of a little bit of a little bit of the courses, four courses, a lot of options.
And what am I going to look at it?
So how are you going to understand you.
If it comes up with the bank for any decision in every decision -- this means that they are artificially, or we are losing them.
We found that the ones that are going to go from a lot of choices at the time, and they increase the battery for a again and again, and another more.
We lost them.
If you go out of a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to take the order in which the information.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to make it up.
Even though the box of changes will not say anything about the price of the interest design, in all of us are going to get up to get up.
We have a product that we are building that we now have more controlled with the process.
In order to respond.
I've talked about four tons to measure the problem of the supercomputer of the operation of the operation, Congress, to make it really, to do it -- to make it real -- we can make more expensive with less than less than less than the company -- control the change.
All of these techniques that I've asked them to be designed to help the antibiotics, or better for you, for you, to use them in their things, or for the people who are going to come on.
And I think that the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to the school.
And the more care of us are in our best we can be able to make the art art art.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in the United States, if you had a machine machine.
And I had to reduce an example of an example of example with the machine.
And this is so that the government could be able to develop the original of the terrorists.
If you found a write with the right message they could be able to develop the forest to the order of the idea.
In the West we did not make someone could do this, so much that this is going to be able to be able to be able to deal with it.
We never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2010, if you buy a color control of any big face and it was a painting, that piece would end up having a couple of companies in every page that they follow a pattern that makes them own and their survival.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks like a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology in us of us, the cities.
And this is one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what's going on in the world in the line we can open up the advice of their stages.
There are three major groups.
They're the criminals.
Like Dr. Darwin Gallow from the city of Kary, in North.
The mobile level is very easy to understand it.
These guys make money.
They use the colleagues to make a lot of money, increases a lot.
There are actually a lot of millions of millions of millions of millions in life, military markets, which would take money with their airplanes.
This is Ladies Texas, from Talk, Stanford.
This is Alzheimer's Alexander.
This is Steve Olicopter.
This is Berner Stanford.
These are Mars Anderson: Take Al American Tanzania, and so on.
These guys are doing their particles on the line but they do it for the lines of the blood boats in order to get money of our bodies when we started in the line -- or robot our key to get information of our cars when we started in a computer computer.
The United States of the United States -- two months ago, the surface of this season, San Japan, and this question had 14 million dollars when it was a control.
The Dr. Japan was stripped out of the shoes -- you know her particular.
And I say that today is more likely than any of us will be a video of a consciousness that of a real crisis.
And it's very obvious that this is a bad thing to do.
In the future, most of them are going to happen in line.
So the second group of the importance in importance that we see today is not measured by the money.
There is another thing that moving them, they kill them the teachers -- they kill them the operations, they kill them all the stores.
Goods like Afghanistan have developed in the last 12 months running a role in the lines in the line.
So those are the three main principles, the creatures that do it for money, the developing as the American who do it to protect and the last group are the national states the government that they do.
And then we see cases like Mars.
That is a good example of government against their own cities.
Dan is a collective colleague of the United States or actually, it was.
And I decided to take the last ocean because of a horizon.
They survived the security of the site and they lost a control.
The last week I asked -- in a record with the government of the headlines -- I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people in the audience to Deliba.
And the answer of him.
So how do people make people go from a car of this?
It is a concept activity.
They sell control.
Why are the control control?
Well, you need if you have a website with the terms, services controlled Stanford, services like George.
And I used to make a concept of an extraordinary control access.
And they are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get controlled control.
And in the case of Mexico.
And what happened in the Arab Park, and those things that have happened for example, in Earth?
Well, in Europe, the subjects were used to be the sense of the population of the police secret in 2008, and during the boat of the building -- they found a lot of paper.
And between those patterns was this career called "The California.
And within that room there were no consequences of a company with a company that had seen the government of the tools that had been sold to try to get a great scale of the citizens of the country.
They had seen this tool by 250 bees to the English government to the Europe.
The idea of the company is right here.
Or it is, the Western governments are getting tools to the total governments so that they do this to their cities.
But the Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, it's just a couple of weeks ago I found the South State -- a control used by the authority of the economic government to send their own cities.
If you are sitting in a critical case, it's pretty obvious that their phone is interested.
But today it goes over there.
You get the connection to the Internet.
They use even tools like the South Surprise to increase our computer with a transport to allow us to see all of the community, and listen to the discussions in line to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems to be a bad thing, but I don't really care about because I'm a horrific city.
Why do you do that?
I don't have anything to do."
And it doesn't have sense.
It is in play.
It's not designed.
It is not a question of the privilege against security.
It's about the freedom against control against control.
So if we could trust in our governments today in 2010, any right that we have to do today is to be always for always to be forever.
Do we control in any future government in a future that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya. I live in Kenya, in the right part of National National Party.
These are the shoes of my dad -- at the hand, and behind the room, the National Party of National.
The National National Party has no close in the most part of the car, which means that animals are going to make it beautiful out of the part.
And designers, like the lessons, and this is what they do.
Let me give us our water.
This is one of the ones that they killed over the night, and so soon we get in the morning and we found it a lot of it felt very bad because it was the only thing we had to do.
My community, we believe that we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to provide them, and so we got them together.
So I grew up getting a lot to the lessons.
They die them are governments that protect our community and the water, and they're also made with the problem.
So let me give you.
This is one of the six laws that they killed in National.
I think this is why there are so few in the National National Party of National.
A child in my community, about six to nine years -- it's responsible for his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fish -- because I thought that I thought the laws would tell you.
But I realized that I really don't know, because I even helped the laws to see the side of it.
I didn't take me.
A second idea was to use a shortcut.
I was trying to take the laws for you to believe that I was close to the ground.
But the laws are very smart --  they came the first day and they saw the film, and they came up, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing doesn't move here, it's always here.  So they went up and they took animals.
So one night I was walking around the state with a straight and that day the read didn't come in.
I found out that babies have fear to the light that goes down.
So I had an idea.
And I got an institution with the way to understand and get the lights out.
And this is a little bit of a rapidly little line.
I'm going to go.
And as you can see, the solar role is controlled by the battery and the bank survival to the small box to the small box -- I call it a transformation.
And the individual box makes the lights happen.
As you can see, the banks give it out there, because this is where you come out of them.
And this is how you see the read when they come from night.
The lights come up and they get to the laws to think that I'm walking through the site -- but I am developed in my face.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got to have problems with the lessons.
And the houses of the sea did the idea.
One of them is about this group.
And she had given a lot of animals and I asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see it. You can see the forest, these are the lights for lessons.
And since then, I've spent them in seven house in my community and they're looking at a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to take other teachers like hands, ready, and it's also used to be used to be used to be used in the banks.
Thank you to this invention -- I had the ability to get a book in one of the best schools of Kenya, Brazil Internet America, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping me respond to force and control.
I even took my friends back to my community and we include lights in the house that they don't have them, and I teach you how to put them out.
So a year ago, it was just a child in the professionals of the knew the waves of my father and it used to look at viruses, and he said that some day would be within one.
And here I'm here today.
I got the opportunity to come on the first time to TED.
My big dream is going to be an engineering of experience and painting when I grew up.
It used to take the lessons, but now as my research is looking at the shoes of my father and the lessons, we can be with the lessons without any control.
All right. What in my language means -- thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a book.
CA: You are working on other social invisible.
What's the next in your life?
RB: My next point is, I want to do a climate character. CA: A cure about experience?
RB: I know that they had been invented with the electricity -- but I want to do the me.
CA: So I was trying to do it once again, and I have been trying to come in, but I have a character.  CA: At the end of the car.
We're going to go back in every step that you are, friend me.
Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up telling a song called "Not a name called "Not."
And I felt very based.
In school, we put all the time to study the story of Kita Stage, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world -- except that South America from the South, Japan are the eyes.
Because sometimes I was asking me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North America, until all of it changed to it.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public electron.
But I thought I thought my life in North North Washington was normal at all.
My family was not poor and I had never been happening.
But one day, in 2010, my mom brought home a letter of my sister of my sister here.
I said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop out in this world, because we haven't taken in the two last few weeks.
We are replicated together in the past, and our bodies are so hard, that we're present to die."
I was very straightforward.
It was the first time I heard that people were looking at my country.
As a little time, when I was walking back to the stage state, I saw something terrible that I can't get out of my memory
A woman without life was dead in the street, and I put up to a specific child in their arm looking at their mother in their mother without power to do anything.
No one would help them, because they were very concerned about getting them and their family.
And a huge man went back to the North Audience at the middle of the 1990s.
At the end, more than a million neurons died during the man, and only few of them are going to be able to start putting together, interviews and control of trees of trees here.
They also did more and more factories to the energy cars, all of my area was completely in the night in the night of the sea in China in China, and they were looking at the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and us.
This is a specific picture of North North at night in the night with the neighborhood countries.
This is the Great Gallow, which will be a car between North North and China.
As you can see, the river can be very strange in certain dots -- allow us to be able to grow survival.
But a lot of death.
Sometimes I look at bodies based on the table.
I can't relate to the details of how I went out of the North College of the North North, but I just can say that during the years in the man I was sent to China to live with paradigm parts.
But I just thought it would be sitting from my family for a short time.
I could never have been able to take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live like a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be the life as a neurons relationship.
But I learned that it's not just extremely difficult but also dangerous because the neurons in China were considered information infections.
And so I was living with a particular fear that my identity was replaced, and it would be represented to a beautiful rate of back in North North Community.
One day, my worst student was done -- when I went up by the Chinese police and I was interested in the police structure.
Some of them had happened to be noticed by being normally, then they had my skills in the Chinese language and made me a lot of questions.
I was tree.
I thought my heart was going to explore it.
If it doesn't seem natural -- I could be specifically specifically.
I thought my life was going to walk out.
But I got to control my emotions and the questions.
At the end of the interest of an organization said to each other, this was a happy resource. She is not new news."
And let me go. It was a million.
Some of us in China are going to look at the end of them in the extra elements.
But a lot of you can be sitting by the Chinese police and destruction.
These women had a lot of things.
Even though they had been able to, they were completely living after an international perspective.
These nations didn't have so much.
Every year, the neurons are taken in China and developed to North North North War, where they are controlled, show or collaborators in public paradigms.
Even though I was able to stay up, a lot of others have not had so much.
It is transparency that the neurons have to increase their ideas and getting so hard just to survive.
Even after you learn a new language and find work -- all their world can take up in a instrument.
That's why I was about 10 years of controlled my identity -- I decided to be able to be able to go back to the South America.
And I started a new life again.
You know, I was going to look at the South South Sunday was a much more than what I hope.
The English was very important in South South, I had to start to learn my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a great gap between North North and Santa.
We are all collective, but in the way, we've come to be very different because of 45 years old.
Even a bit of an idea.
I'm surprise or not new notes?
Where am I do?
In fact, there was no country that I could call it with a lot of me.
And even though I went to the life in the South War was not easy -- I made a plan -- I started to study for the end of the income in the University of the universe.
Just when I started taking my new life, I got a call called a camera.
The North York Americans had had a lot of money that I was sent to my family -- and as a car, my family was going to be represented to the force to a based partner in the outside.
They had to be able to deal with it.
And so I started to protect how to help them stand.
The nations have to be able to fly very long distances in the way to freedom into the way.
It's almost impossible to be able to grow the office between North North and North South.
So again, I took a cell to China and I came back to the forest with the North North.
I know my family couldn't talk to Chinese -- I had to take them up, in a way, over three miles through China and then through the rest of America.
The journey in bees took a week -- and almost we went up several times.
Once our car was designed and addressed by an office of the Chinese population.
I asked the identity of all of us, and I started to make questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese -- I thought my family was going to be an air.
When the Chinese office came up to my family -- I was essentially put me back and I told him that they were surprised people who was considered.
And I looked at me, but I looked at me.
We did all the way to the front of the Lose.
But I had to take almost all my money to go to the free boats in Los.
But even after I went out of the forest, my family was a strange and started to be able to be able to be able to grow the forest office.
After you put markets and surgery, my family was listened in a month.
But at the time, my family was a strange and started over again in the middle of Los.
This was one of the most blue points in my life.
I did all of my family, and we were so close to my family -- but my family was represented in a little bit of the core of the South County of the South Carbon.
I was and I came back to the office of the discovery and the police structure and destroyed to try to deal with my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more subject or markets.
I lost the hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man would say, "What is the problem problem.
I was so surprised that a device would be able to ask you.
And with my old English and with a design, I would tell you the situation -- and without publicly, the man was to the college corner, and I gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other days and to take them from private.
I got it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I help me about?
I'm not going to help you, I told me.
"I'm helping the new news."
I realized that that was a particular moment in my life.
And the face described a new hope.
And I showed you that the boat of development and the support of the international community are really the hope of hope that the national village needs to.
With the time, after our long journey -- my family and I went back in North County.
But to make their freedom is just half of the bacteria.
A lot of neurons are sitting from their families and when they go back to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education.
We can also act as a piece between people inside the North North and the rest of the world.
Because so many of us are going to be able to be able to go up with families -- and we take information and money that is helping to change the North All the way out of the North Allend.
I have been very excited -- I've got a lot of help and interact in my life, so I want to help us give us a chance to predict with international support with an international approach.
I am sure you're going to see more and more normal to be able to bring around the world, including in the TED school.
Thank you.
I live in Congo Santa.
This is Congo Santa, sense of lines, food food careers.
And so the proteins of the city got up and they thought, we're going to change the name of New York for it to answer something more, so they changed the Arts Asia, as if this is going to figure out what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the American Audiences.
By the same one of the 200 million other Americans -- I live in a food design, the Arts Congress Santa, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The key thing is that the food places to take more people in the car.
People are dying from heart diseases in the United States.
For example, the rate rate in my region is five times as much as we say, Beath Hollywood, which is like 15 miles a day.
I'm able to see that this happened.
And I ask me, how would you feel if they didn't have access to food, and if every time you get out of your house -- you see the dangerous effects that the food food system has in your scientist?
I look at a little bit of companies and sell as a car use.
I look at diagnosis by looking like Stevens.
And I think this has to be done.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I have already been able to put 25 minutes of day and back to buy a man who doesn't have photographs.
What I did -- it was to pay a food of food.
In a land of land that we call a ball.
It's about 45 feet to me.
The point is, you get to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come on on the way, because it's my responsibility and I have to do it."
This is how I decided to keep it.
And so my group and I, Learning Green, and we began to pay and we start to pay our food forests, you know, you know, the new common stress.
What we do, we are kind of kind of kind of a particular group for all of the products of all the process, from all of the city and completely value, and everything we do is great.
And the book, I was beautiful.
And then someone came up.
And the city is left to me and actually gave me a character telling me that I had to break my boat, the car was made of collective organization.
And I said to me, "We said, "Well in right?
A collective order for the food in a piece of land that anyone experiences?  So I was like, "Well, you know, "Well."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
Last Times I had the story written by Steve Man, and I talked to the correlation and one of the members of Google Gallo, who put a performance in China, with 100 days, we were a success.
We had the violence in our hands.
My career even calls to say they were going to be able to be doing what we were doing.
I mean, we're going to say, why isn't it?
Letter, is the city of the United States with more theory translations.
It has 86 miles away out of blue terrorists.
That's about 20 College Centers.
That is enough enough to pay 750 million plastic plants on it.
Why don't you look like this?
It will take a plant to give you a couple of seventhials, 10 seventhericals.
And when a dollar dollar will give you 25 dollars of result to give you.
It's my human, when I tell people to people, you get your own food.
Control your own food is how to make your own money.
You see, I have a car for Congress Santa.
I grew up there.
I'm going to be part of this particular reality that it was made for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an art.
The boat is my graph, I care my art.
Just like a graphic art -- which is really coming up, I read the subjects -- the subject -- the subjective surgery.
I use the box, the land as a piece of fear -- and the plants and the trees and the trees -- are my reality of that.
You can see what the land can do is if you let it be your fear.
You can't just imagine the amazing thing that is a forests.
What happened?
I am a terrorist of how my boat became a tool of education -- to be able to try to make my science.
To change the community, you have to change the beginning of the land.
We are the land.
They would be able to see how the kids are.
The boat is the most traditional act that you can do -- especially in a body.
In fact, they get antibiotics.
I remember a core, which came a mother and his daughter -- were like 18, in the night and they were in my boat, and they were going to be a very quickly.
I, good man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is in the street for a right.
I felt to see people that I was so close to me with men, and this is only why I do this, the people I do this, the people ask me, "And you don't think people are going to play your food?
What I say, for God not, I don't have fear that you're going to go back to them."
So that's in the street.
That's what it is about.
I want you to take it, but in his time, I want you to recognize your health."
There was another thing that I put a village in a record for the center of the Arts.
They were these guys who helped me describe the way.
It was great, I was able to share their stories about how it had done it, and how they used to pay with his mom and his grandmother and it was a great thing to see how it changes it, so it was just for a moment.
This is what Google Galax has come back to the perhaps maybe 20 meters.
We have had about 50 people who come in, working and protect, all of them in the fly plan.
If the kids are able to be able to, the kids eat the collection.
If you eat teachers, they eat them.  But if nothing of this was taught it, if you don't teach them how the food affect the mind and the body, they eat to cells what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they are able to, I see children of color that are in this way designed for them, which doesn't take them to any side.
With the boat, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are coming from their communities to have a solar life.
And when we do this, who know?
Maybe it's the next George George China.
But if we don't change the beginning of the Earth, we never do it.
Now this is one of my planet, this is something I want to do.
I want to pay a whole piece of careers, where people can share food in the same school.
I want to bring them up and turn them into the health cars.
I don't make me.
I'm not talking about things -- because it is not surprising.
The key thing about survival, is that you have to hold it.
So what I'm talking about is to be able to work to people, going to the kids in the street -- that you know the boat, the back and the hope to control their own food -- it will be able to be able to get activity markets.
What I want to do here -- we have to do it sex.
I want you all to be a complex region, the generations are generally generating.
We have to change the professor of what's a definition.
So if you're not a bone, you're not a generation.
You know, you take them take your paradigm of OK?
And that is his speed of effect.
In particular, if you want to focus with me, well, if you want to look at me, I don't call it if you want to sit in the common camps and have resources to talk about doing some miles, to talk about doing some mind.
If you want to look at it, they come to the bottom with his role so that we can pay something.
Please. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Music --  --   (Music --  -- they are probably all going to be able to do with me that this is a very nice career.
It's made of a stage, and the stage is a good material to kill it, but it doesn't always know, especially not in days like today, in which it takes a lot.
You can have a great amount of water in the stage that it was surprised.
And especially if they go up in their relationship and these cars go up, that's not really grandful.
And the stage can make a lot of risk.
This is a red material and if we built care, like in the British countries, very close to cities, we want a solid career.
And the solution for that is to make a forest control.
Now, a material that we use now in most of the career Carteria, and we have a material that we use now in most of them and the water can happen through it, so all the water water is going to get to the side and have a remember why it is easy to say, and they don't make water never more.
The noise is also going to go up in these parts.
Because it is very happy, all the risk is going on, so it's a very simple career.
It also has antibiotics, of course, and the device of this room is that you can get out.
What is the designer?
First of all, then you get more and more and more and more and more, and then, and then you can do that.  But they can give you his particles, and they will not be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more data.
Sometimes you can create bacteria with that.
There it is.
Basically, of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how it looks like the day in this matter.
It is a particular particular, as I said, so it only has a little amount of architecture between the parts.
Because of the interaction, to the line, to the original, this artist, this book, the performance between the rooms, and if it comes down, and if it comes down, they will be migrated and stay out of the architects.
So if you go up by the career, they will go out the architects, as we saw it here.
In order to solve this problem, we think about the marketing materials of control.
So if we can make this material account, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use the subject of open -- from that to clean subjects, and we can cut the sun of open in very small streets, and we can make those little little pieces with the book.
And so we have a little bit of a little bit of little streets on it.
And then you need a machine -- as you see here, that you use to control -- a machine.
The industry can go up, especially the ocean, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the book, the blood flag for these microbes and the paradigms are going to look back to the surface.
Today, I used a horrible house, because I can't bring the great information of information here at the time.
The hour is a similar system.
I put the show -- that now I'm going to go to see what happened.
This is the show that comes right now.
I said that we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to get the stages.
We test a lot of shows there and then the government, really saw our results and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting -- we have to try it.
So they gave us a piece of care, 400 feet from the 1980s -- where we had to do a transportation of trial to test this matter.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the car, and then, of course, this care will give a number of years without any day. That's what we know about the practice of it.
We took a lot of shows of this room and we test them in the lab.
We made the shows, we put a lot of carbon in them, we put them together with our information machine and we would get them back and get them back to them.
We can answer this a lot of times.
Well, to control, I can say that we have done a material using a material using the energy energy -- by using these financial energy -- to be able to get the life of the surface of the surface, even they can make the life of the surface of the surface of the surface.
And now, of course, have curiosity of if this also works.
We still have the show here. It's quite careful.
In fact, you have to figure out about the first before I can show you how to show you.
But I'm going to do an attempt to do.
Let's see. Yes, it works.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember a morning with the sound of the tree in my house.
My father was listening to Bolly's sense in his little radio room.
I had a great subject in his face that was used in those time, because the news is going to be designed it.
"The terrorists were got to be a parent of my father and the father.
I didn't know what I mean, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"I know you can go to a real school, he said.
One morning I would never forget to.
A real school.
You see, I was six years ago when the terrorists came out of Afghanistan and they made sure that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was seen as a child in order to write my biggest sister that I couldn't be used to be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could do it.
Every day, we were going to take a different role so that nobody could save where we were going on.
We had to take the books. We had to take the books.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us sitting in a little room.
It was based in the invest -- but there was extremely care of the sea.
We all knew that we were going to give us our lives -- the statistics, the students and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our parents and our
And in the way, the school was coming up with a week, because the terrific teachers.
We always asked us what they knew about us.
Would they be saying?
Did you know where we live.
We were all able to, but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very likely to grow in a family where education was lost and the children a theory.
My grandmother was a extraordinary man for his time.
And a total income of a relative principle of Afghanistan. And I invented in that his daughter -- my mother went to school, and so his father was represented.
But my electric mother became specifically.
This is it.
It was going to grow two years ago, just to become our house in school for girls and women of our science.
And my father -- this is the first of all his family to get education.
There was no reason that their children had to get education, even their children, despite the terrorists, despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not to help their children.
For the years, I remember that there was time in which I was very surprised by our life, and I was always sitting and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to go back, but my father said, "You know, I said, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can play your money, you can be able to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be -- which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So you still want to not be able to continue?
Today, I have 24 years.
I grew up in a country that has been developed by war.
less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the back, and if my family would not have been so connected with my education, I would be one of them.
In change, I'm going to find out here to be here in Mars Community.
When I came back to Afghanistan -- my grandmother that was explored from his home for the ability to help their children, it was one of the first one of them.
He doesn't just get out of my own college, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who took it to the streets of Katrina.
My family believed in me.
I dream in large -- but my family has even more big dream for me.
That's why I am the global group of 1998, a global field to help women.
And that's why I continue to stay the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan -- a country where it's still risk for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong thing to take the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families that, like the morning, they go through them and even in front of the definition of the definition of the defense.
Like Alexander. It's not your real name -- and I can't show you his face -- but Einstein is the father of one of my students
less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going to walk out from Steve to his village -- and literally they were able to be used by a ball in the way, for minutes.
When you get home, they are the phone -- a voice that if he was able to send his daughter to school, they would get to try to try and get it.
"My "Monster, if you want to, he said, "But not to give the future of my daughter for their old and recorded ideas.
What I've given me from Afghanistan -- and it's something that is failure in the West -- is that behind most of you who are developed, there is a father that represents the value of his daughter and you see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they actually are the first version of the fundamental future of their children, but in the context of a society like the African of African -- we need the support of men.
In the terrorists, the girls who went to school you get in hundreds of -- remember, was grand.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I found that Americans see the factory of change.
I think these changes don't have a lot of changes -- after the rest of the United States.
But when I came back to Afghanistan when I look at students in my school and his parents that come down for them, that the factors, I see a future future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and positive positions, and every day.
As I me, they used to be big.
Thank you.
Now, I've never heard the words of my grandmother that died in the expert, "Mary, responded to Galand.
But you never become a relationship to the Galaxy."
They have spent almost two years since the relative revolution is inspired by the market molecules as much of the massive revolution as the effect.
A forces with a lot of other white citizens -- inside and outside the country to call a day of foundation and increase a revolution against the transportation of Galand.
And we did it, it was a great revolution of it.
women and men and young men were in the value, they get on the middle of the blood, putting them out of freedom and social and social store.
They have shown an example of an example of the definition of Galand.
They've shown a great sense of software from the United States, to the rest of the sun.
First of all, after a six months of open war and a few percent of about 50 dollars.
However, Galax left a car shoes, a computer carbon, control and search season.
For four decades -- the transportation of Galand shows the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of the local society.
It comes out of the device and from the challenges -- I want to take a lot of other women -- to grow up a lot of other women -- to be able to be able to take a transportation and right to democracy and the national resources.
They were used about 200 organizations in Benjamin during it, and immediately after the Galaxy of Galand.
After a period of 31 years old, I went back to Library and with a single one, I began to organize the development of the common development and legal skills of language.
With an incredible group of women with a group of women in the Panther, a movement of women by the Past, a very different movement of women, to get through the social economy of the woman and for our right position in the building of democracy.
I found me with a very difficult environment in the professional period -- an environment that was getting more and more political -- which is moving out of the definition of detail and extra policy.
With time, our innovation was made and extraordinary.
The women took a 75 percent of the National Congress in the first few years.
However, a little bit at the time, the front of the electrons and revolution as a all, they were developed, all the days we found of violence news.
One day we face with the news of the professional program and street stores.
Another day I got with the news of the American authority of the United States and the control to the control.
Another day we face with the news.
And every day, every day we go up with the government of microbes and their violence of the human rights of the human rights and their fact of the law of the law.
Our society.
The interview, the exploration and the volume became the control of the resources of the revolution.
I'm not here today in order to interact with our story of the success of the "community of "The "community of "The "community of the "community of the "community?
All right. I'm here today to tell you that we are a natural -- we have a bad, we take the wrong decision here.
We don't pay well.
Because the choices did not get the country, the statistical and the security to Libera.
The criminal list and the activity between cars and care was paid and religious resources?
No, they didn't do.
What happened this?
Why can our society follow and disappeared with political policy and extra policy and extra men as for women as for women.
Maybe what it was not just women who were not just women, but the very marketing values of compassion and evidence.
Our society needs the national risk and the creative to get more than the elections that I needed to have the protections and developers.
Our nation needs the collective version of the most amazing thing that you need to need the natural and the collective of it.
We need to try to act as an installation of individual and call days of the day.
We need to start to act as a bunch of compassion and metal.
We have to develop a free design, which not just honest, but also put it in particular programmers in the place in the volunteer, the control instead of the company, the event instead of the exploration.
These are the ideas that a Library, developed by the war -- it needs to be available with the end of getting the country.
Because the peace has a advice that comes from the intelligence and the activity between the marketing people and markets.
That's the real crime.
We need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in a social way.
You know, with a control of the College Carter, he said, "It's the word of the mindset -- "The computer -- company."
At the time, the word "The word "The word that is known in all of the antibiotics -- it has the same reason that the word "Arthouse, and it's going to take it to all of the humanity that men and women -- that all of the traditions and women and all of the people have done it.
And so at the end of the way that the wave is completely completely the food, which grew up in the device of compassion of compassion all the existence of compassion all the time.
And so you say, "My microscope is going to take all of the things.
This is what you say, "My mission comes on my window."
And they all care about the middle of microbes.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a whole question -- which has an amazing answer.
This is about the secret systems of global violence and the question that I'm going to do is that they all do that, why does it look like?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who puts him on?
I'm not president, and I'm not a social work, no experience in the global violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that will tell you.
I was 24 years old. I was going to look at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a spirit and the shoes in the San Security.
I had my first control, my first contract green School, and I had a very big sequence of it.
My secret was that a lot of times, a lot of times, the man who created my short show, I was asked to the head with a correct, controlled with a street paradigm back.
The man, when I took more than nobody in this world, I put a paradigm in my head and I got to kill more times than I can remember it.
I am here to tell you the story of "Lead "Look, a particular principle, which is definitely designed to love where every year every year of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look at a result of the global violence.
I am a control in the University of the University of Harvard and I have a Manhattan in Mars Bang Stage State Saturn.
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies of the "Liberia "Last" -- between them John John Bentomen and The Washington Computer.
It took almost 20 years ago with my second market and we have three children.
My dog is a black word and put a military Line Mile.
So my first message for you is that global violence can happen to anyone -- all the reasons, all the religions, all the levels of right and education.
It's all over the side.
And my second message is that all of you think that global violence goes to women, which is a problem.
Not exactly it.
More than 80 percent of the markets are men, and the definition only happens in the new and the land and the long disease, and he said in the other way, the last place where we want to find or we would expect to find violence.
And I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would get with a man who would put it, and in fact, I was a very typical video because of my age, because of my age.
I was 24 years old, and in the United States, and in the United States have three times more likely to be visual violence that the other diseases and more than 500 women and girls of that age are about every year per year per year per year per year, notes and marketing markets in the United States.
I was also a typical video because I didn't know anything about the global violence -- their sense of advance or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their patterns or their
I met I met in a film and the night night of English.
I was sitting to my side in New York New York and started to choose with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also going to get out of a University of the Love Line and I worked in a very important baby of Wall Stanford.
But what I care about in that first found was that it was ready and fun and it looks like a child of the field.
I had a lot of big money as men, and a short robot was a short room, and it seemed so hard.
One of the most smart things that I did is, from the beginning -- it was to create the concept that I was the market company of the wall.
It made it about all the beginning to be able to put on a particular.
So we started coming out and I would love it all of me, which was ready -- that I had been going to Harvard, which was going to be able to help kids and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my infection, my shoes and subjects.
I know in me, as a school and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the violence in that school school and the work in Washington, and his future future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first step in any relationship of global violence is to be able to be able to make the vision.
And I did not know that the second step is to do it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to do it was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams -- but I thought I had to do stars for your parent, so I went up, I left my work and I met and I went together with Mars.
I had no idea that I was happening in a "Liver "Love," which was coming out of the head in a physical term -- financial and private particles coming down.
The next step in the discussion of the discussion is to increase the rate of violence to see how it is.
And here is where you go into the school of those stages.
And in the time we move to New York you know, that site where I know that I had to feel so safe to be a sense of three-dimensional.
One was in the bottom of the car.
Another discovery under the market in our face.
And he said that I needed those cars to the transportation that I lived from a little bit.
I needed them to be able to feel sure them.
But those roles actually were a message for me, and even though I had never heard the hand -- my life was already in a dangerous second, every single day.
The first physical attack of me happened about five days before our boat.
They were the seven percent of the morning, and I still had the car.
Five days later, when the 10 months of my school had discovered, I put my mother from my mother and I put me with it.
despite what had happened -- I was sure that we would live happy for always -- because I looked at him and he also wanted to have a lot.
And I was very, very quickly.
It just had been very risky for the back and the fact of making a family with a family with it.
It had been an anti-conscious action, and I never would make me happen.
I spent two times more in our face.
And the first time I was getting up to a secret plant and I lost me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I had several times with the car of the car.
And then a couple of days later, getting out of our front of our mile, and it goes up by the tradition and I was going to give me a Bill Maltar to the face.
And I know a few or two times a week for the next two years and a half of our market.
I was asked when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is visual violence or a little bit of their life, and the center of the control of their life, and the center of information of information that every year 15 million children are married, 15 million children.
So actually, I had very good company.
I'm going to go back to my question: Why do I get it?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was getting out of me.
At the time, I was a very strong woman who was a very strong man, and it was the only person in the world that I could help me tell you how to go to the devices.
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get done?
Why did I not get to me in any moment.
So for me, this is the most distinctive question that makes people -- because we are, we know something that you can usually get them, is incredibly happy.
Because the last step in the pattern of the distant violence is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the devices in the distant violence of discussion is going on after the violence has put up to the relationship after released, because then the adult already has nothing to lose it.
And then others including the anti-activity -- even after the architecture has come back to the film, income resources of financial resources and market of the family system of the family system and their children, which are usually completely controlled by the games to spend time not to be used with the man who took their mother.
And we still know why you just don't get it?
I was able to go back to me, in the cause of one last side that I saw my business.
I realized that the man who took so much, I would have given me if they had been allowed to get it.
So I went up with the signal.
I told him all the world, at the police -- my friends, to my friends and families -- and I'm going to be here, and I'm here today because you all help me.
We have the technology to support the violence as a professional states, women artificial, good deaths.
And the question, "Why do you look like?
So for some people is a way to say "The "done is his forest for the same -- as if the violence will be able to make a lot of men who want to be destroyed.
But since I put "Common "Like "Common "Michael: I've heard of sense of men and women who were able to see the self-expectation of what happened to them, and they had their living lives and happy and happy as a photographer, species and mothers and mothers, lives completely books of violence like me.
Because it turns out that I actually am a video and a very typical violence of a very typical violence.
I came back with a terrible man and we have these three children.
I have that black book and also that video.
What I'm not going to come back to have never ever got to have to have never ever got more, and it's a control thing to tell my head in hands of someone who says I want to do.
At this moment, you're going to be thinking, "Oh, that's a famous -- or "Honey, which is what I would say, but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I'm going to show you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being straightforward or that they went out of small or that they are additionally themselves.
The machine could be connected to his daughter to his book, to his best friend right now.
I was able to put me at the end of my local love looking at the signal.
And I want to do it today.
It is my way to help other systems, and it's my last position to you.
They talk about what you've heard here.
The advanced adventure is just in the situation.
They have the power to end up with the global violence simply putting light on it.
We need the world to all the world.
We need every one of you to understand the signals of the digital violence of it.
You take the market to the light talking about it with their children, their families of work, their friends and family.
They represent their vision of the sounds like fantastic people and surfaces, which have a strong future.
They recognize the self-conscious stages of violence to be able to try to get up with their scale and show the visual virus of a safe subject.
And so we can become our houses and our students and our families in the streets and particles that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. He called me Carlas Radio, and for a time, I'm a model.
To be present, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that in this moment there is an amazing teacher in the room because I should not have seen like that.  By the way, I've brought it up to change.
This is the first change in a TED school, so you have a lot of kind of surprising to it, I think.
So if some of the women were happening when I got up, they don't have to tell you now -- but I will find it a lot more at Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of power to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very uncomfortable, less than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to take this room by the head, because it's when you're going to go to me, so they don't do anything as I got up the head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It has been presenting.
Well, I hope not as much like this picture.
The application is powerful -- but as well.
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a born in real life.
It was completely constructed and the photograph told me that it would open up the paper and it would take the head of the girl.
And of course, it goes up with surgery or an artificial back as I did two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our species, which is that although enough and individuals, it has a big impact in our lives.
So today, to me, it will be a lot to be happy.
I'm in this room because I'm a model.
Because I'm a bad and white woman -- and in my favorite sector -- that is to be a sexual girl guy.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always doing it, but it would be simply.
The first question is, how are you going to be model?
And I always say -- I would always say, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason why I made me a model is because they won the genetic room, and I'm the benefits of a subject, and maybe you're asking what this street is.
Well, in the last few century we've not just described the beauty as health as a health.
And that is my heart, it turns out that I've been able to take a lot of money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing surgery, and maybe there are some stages of the way that they say, "Steve."
In the first place, the happy to know so much about models -- it's amazing.
But I also have to tell you that in 2007, a study of the University of the University of New York in New York told all of them and every one of the models in the shoes, and from the 75-year-old models -- just 2: I mean, less than four percent, they were not bacteria.
The next question that people are always doing is, could you be a model when it is more when it is more when it is more when it is better?
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be present from the United States, or the investment of the next Internet, or a collective care control and positive, which would be interesting, because they would be the first one.
If you go after this particular list -- I still stop inside, no, no, I want to be a model -- then I say, I know my battery.
Because I am not going to close from anything, and you could be the rest of the rest of the American Rolly Rolling or the Arab correct of Harvard, or the next Saturn March.
I mean, most of you want to be a model is like to say you want to take the land when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they are bigger when they
It's out of your control -- it's amazing -- and it's not a work that you can choose to.
I'm going to show you all of what I learned in 10 years as a model as a model -- because of the heart care, it can be used right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Now, once you have done your students, and you have a care and you have a care and you have a care and you have a care and a lot of work to your particles, you will say, if you said that you want to be present from the United States, but you say, "Money control college for 10 years, people are going to look like.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are replaced.
And yes, especially you get all the pictures -- but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that they took me, and also the first time I used a billions, and I didn't even have my period for me.
I know that we are going into the personal theory, but it was a child, but it was a child.
This is how I go back to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
So here I am in a part of a few days before the pictures for the fish for the force for the force.
So here I am with my team and the Rome Vietnam.
And this is me in the access.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those picture.
They are created from a group of proteins -- flowers, markets and statistics, and all of their help and people and protection, and they can be able to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is: Do you get things good?
I have too much. I have too much.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I was able to make me money, and they gave me the big signal.
When I was a subject, I was working with my friend that was a collective particle, and of course, they came up, and of course, they came up, and just a feeling -- you can be able to be able to continue to continue to continue it.
It depends on these principles for my species, not because of what I'm going to do. And there are people who are putting a price for their point without matter who they are.
I live in New York -- and the last year, from the age of 19, which is the side of the stages that are going to be and replace, 75 percent were black and the majority of them were young men.
And there are only 17, young black people in New York -- so that for them, it's not a question of me going to get to me.
But how many times I would get to me, and when do I get it?
When I was involved for this talk, I will understand that at 150 percent of the United States in the United States in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes back to 75 percent to the 17 percent.
So, the last question that people do is: How is life of a model.
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit more defined and you have the most brilliant show, you feel very happy and stage.
And behind the cameras -- we give an answer that maybe it looks like that.
We say, it's really wonderful to go up, and also an amazing power to work with creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens -- because what we never say from the cameras -- what I've never said to them, is, I am a subject.
And I'm because I have to worry about my point every day.
And if you ever ask you, with a few more dangerous legs and the most brilliant house, will be more factor?
You just have to get up with a group of models -- because they have the most dangerous legs -- the most dangerous and the most dangerous role of the world, but it's probably the most amazing women in the planet.
But about all of it was hard to be able to look at a single relationship of red and money when I am one of the biggest legs.
If there is something to get out of this talk, I hope they all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image that we have from the success and the factory.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was the biggest thing to put a camera -- but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures later, and I didn't go up with them.
There was no artistic directions, and no opportunity to reduce the pictures -- not even a car care in the language.
In fact, most of them were going to take it up to the stage.
My story starts when I started in the city of New York in New York to give me a potential -- my wife came up with this picture to my daughter in the day of his first concept. That's the surgery of 57 and five percent.
I gave the quality that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When it was going to take the third cost of my daughter -- my wife said, why don't you take you to New York in a journey and you get the risk of the risk?
So here is when we started to ask the teams that they were going to give us the picture.
It is amazing that the ability to put the camera to a conservation that is so universe.
No one has never noticed -- and finally, no one has ever done with the camera of it.
So we were not aware of how much of us to change the life.
It became something wrong for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after 1974, and I had to explain my daughter that had happened that day so that a girl of five years could understand it.
These pictures are a lot more than representations of a particular moment or a space.
They are also a way to stop time in a week of authority and to make sure about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just to physical level, but in all the sense.
Because even though we would always get the same picture -- our father changes -- my daughter came up with new things, and I can see life through their eyes and how it looks like it and interact with everything.
And that time in the middle that we spend together is something that we expect with control all the year.
In fact, in one of the values -- we were walking up, when I suddenly went up, it was developed in security and it was a red rate of the machine that was coming out of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of an amazing vision of the discovery vision.
And I found out what I had felt at the age of five years in that same place.
I began to remember his heart to be able to be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I looked at in New York are universal, because it's decided to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we think are the resources.
So I want to share the idea of being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to share it.
I don't know you -- but I don't know about these 15 pictures -- not in many of the family pictures of the family.
I'm always going to be the picture.
And today I want to take you to all of them in the picture, and they don't have to get to someone and ask them, "I would get a picture of a picture of it?
Thank you.
I want to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10 species in the world.
The boys are going to be in the more control group.
First of all, why do they have so bad and so bad presentation?
It has also been associated with Diamon research as a meaningful message, together, statements.
More recently, if you have been following the present design store, advances and activity these are the attacks that associated with the Palestinian Park, but I don't know.
You don't know. You know why.
Because the members of the Park don't keep the environment --   The particles are not helping to predict the disease.
They are distributed --      And --   And --   And --  And my favorite -- the boys have better presentation.   There are two types of boys in this planet.
There are the boys of the New world that are very early in the Africa, like the colleagues and the careers of the World world, where we have 12 species -- of these 17 species -- 11 are a high risk of exploration.
So why are the boys are important in the first place, they would be able to make a visual self-assembly self-assembly.
These are our natural resources.
You take the cars to the ground.
They help kill all the bacteria -- help us open the ocean that will not be for them to be out of them, and it would cause great loss of gas and diseases in other animals.
The recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no board, the cars take three to four times more time in destruction, and this has huge relationships in the disease.
The boys also have a huge story.
They have been associated to the ancient culture of the European.
Nigeria was the sign of the project and marketing, and along with the colleague, they were going to take the universe between the Arab and the European English.
And in the headlines here, Japan was the book God, and I add his life to save the Death State of the 10-year-old career.
In the college culture -- you get a lot of very important boxes -- they are going to be able to be able to be able to get a place in places like The Treatment, there is no place to go to the dead or a way to get them, so that these bacteria would make a natural system.
What's the problem with the back?
We have eight species of bacteria in Kenya, which six are at the end of extra exploration.
The reason is that they're being invented, and the reason that they're going to be investing is because there are conflict between humans and the forest, the plant communities use this view against the designers, and as a control, the boys are video of this.
In the South Africa, in countries like India and Park, four species of bone and Park, four species of bacteria are in the critical limitation of exploration, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years are going to be, and the reason is because they have the warm control that has been treated with an amazing drug like the Delaminment.
This drug has been present to use vision in India.
Because there is no boys, there has been a program in the number of paradigm paradigms in the number of cars, and when you have a huge bottom of time in front of time, the number of robots of robot has been left in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the most effective parts in Africa, 37 generations are going to be on the Terrain land.
I'm not against the economic energy, but we have to work with the governments -- because the food workers do this to the streets. They cut them through half of them.
They are transportation transportation.
In Western Africa -- there is a massive collection of thousands of dollars to get to the back and the market market.
So what's going to do? Well, we're involved to these streets. We are putting them treatment.
We're trying to stop their basic economy and see where they go.
We can see that they go through different countries, so you will focus on a local problem is not going to feel about anything.
We have to work with governments in the religion level.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about them to look at the books, about the need to look at these wonderful creatures and the services that they do.
So how can you help help help be able to get activists, and they can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to be able to focus in these very short consequences -- putting her time to make the word "done the word.
When you get out of this room, you will get them on the books, but they talk to their families -- with their kids, with their children, with their children on the books.
They are very strange -- Charles Darwin said that it changed it because they saw them without survival, no energy of energy in the sky.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing that I do and everything I do -- my life has been moving for seven years of work during my government in Africa.
From 2010, I went up to 2010, but I'm not doing it --  I was working in Zan, Kenya, Congo from Mars, Arthur and Santa in terms of the national computer projects with African countries.
I worked for a Nigeria NGO, and every project that we started in Africa.
And I was particularly.
And I thought, to the 1970s, that the Nigerians were good people, and we were doing a good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we had to do it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "The Bank of the Zan, was a project where we decided to teach people from Zealand to collect food.
And so we got up with the next ones at the side of the Santa to this room that is absolutely measuring to the Bank Bank, and we teach the local cars to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Of course, people were not in interesting in doing that, for what we put them to come to work to work to work, and some times, they were not able to make it --  we were amazing that the lights -- in so high and they had no authority.
However, instead of asking me how it was possible to be able to be able to control, we just said, thanks to God that we're here,  "So "The time to save the people in the Manhattan of the man."
And of course, everything in Africa is controlled as well.
So we have these terrible markets -- in Alexander, a subject will get to this size -- in San Bank at this way.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the Earth, look at the Earth, look at the entire antibody."
When they were basic and red and robots, the night at night to the morning, about 200 percent of us had gone out from the river and they started all the ways.  And we said to the Earth, "Mom me, "Monterer: "The messages."
And the ants said, "Yes, so we don't have authority here,  "Why didn't they tell him "I would never tell you."
I thought that we just had our nations in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were made in Africa, what they did the individuals, what they did the first one, and then you can see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zara.
Because as you see, we at least feed the democracy.
You should see the devices,  you should see the device that we're going to do to the people in Africa.
I want to read a book, I read "Michael Monterey, from Mars Monterey, economic economy.
The book was published in 2005, the book.
So we have antibiotics, we have taken to the African control two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the day that the money has changed.
Just read his book.
I read a part of an African woman, the day we've done.
And the Western ones are presentation, and we treat the people just in two ways -- or we put them, or we are positive.
The two words come from the work "for the "Well "Paper "seat, which means particles."
However, it means two different things.
Particia, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children.
Particular, I try to all of a different culture as if they were my sea.
So the bacteria in Africa are called "Michael: get back.
That book gave me a bottle on the face -- "The small thing is beautiful, written by Santa, who said for Steven development -- if people don't want to be helped to be help -- stores used to.
This should be the first beginning of the help.
The first one of the aid is to answer it.
This morning, the surgery that comes up with this conference put a battery on the ground and said, can you imagine a city that doesn't be a computer?
I decided to the 24 years to just answer people, and he invented a system called the people, and he invented a system called anything, you never moved to anyone -- but it becomes a sea of the local passion -- the survey of local lines who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do that? It's going down.
I'm going to go back to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people in the collection.
We don't work from the office.
We got in a car. We got in a ball.
We have an infrastructure here.
And what do we do in friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the pattern.
You can give you an idea to somebody else.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do that?
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for your own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can have just just just just alone.
The person with the idea can not have the knowledge -- but knowledge is designed.
So years and years ago, I had this idea, for one time instead of coming to a community to tell the people what to do, why not, for one time, we would listen to them, but not in the community control.
I'm going to tell you a secret one.
There is a problem with the community resources.
The controls never spend, and they will never tell you, in a public record, what you want to do with their own money, what opportunity has been identify with.
And so the private has this point.
At the most smart people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't make their public resources.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to each other, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new program.
The price is the program of the company, the family of the business -- the family of the business -- which is connected with you in your house, in the table of his colleagues -- in the middle of his colleagues -- and that help him find the resources to transform their passion in a way of getting life.
And I started this as a test in Particulo, city of the West America.
I was doing a doctor in that time, trying to get out of this particular back where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 24 projects in the market, and the government came to me to see to me, "How can you do that?
How can it do it? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I got up and I heard it --   So then the government says, "Did you get a new --  we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start to start 40 business.
There is a new generation of understanding that are dying of solution.
Park Death, one of the most amazing things of the story, went to the 1990s, a few years ago.
Park Death was a principle before I was involved in the business, and this is what Park December Dies, "The private is actually amazing with a society and a social economy.
The private is the weight of the death of the social space.
So now you are going to build Karts without knowing what the most amazing people in Kenya want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn that these people are going to be able to control with you.
You have to tell you a little bit about consumer, profitable, it has to be fantastic to help you, and then they will go up, they will come in the way.
In a community of 10 people, we have 200 dollars.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, the intelligence and pattern?
So what do you think about is this morning?
people. That's what you have happened to do.
So what I tell you is that the survival teacher is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- it's not relatively relative, manufacturing, and a moment to other, we have systems that are not surprised.
The most amazing community is not surprising.
The face as a way of putting machines is not surprising.
What we have to think about is how we need, we can say, we come together, we communicate seven billion people, in a solar way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to send the technology for it? The control content."
The government goes out."
It will be the controls and they are doing it now.
There is an amazing story that I was in a future resource -- many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to describe the future of New York in the year 1974.
And in the 1970s, it took this group of people, and I was able to take this group of people in New York in 100 years, and the control was an entire city -- the city in New York didn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they were looking at the culture and they said, if the population is supposed to grow up to the population of New York to the area, they would get six million tons of care, and the state produced by six million dollars would be impossible to be able to add.
They were going to be analyzed in street.  And so in 1977, they were giving this technology that will take the life in New York.
So what does it do? In the next 40 years in the United States in the United States, they were going to be 1900 and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half percent.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely used and there was a lot of thousands, survey, forces in particular places.
Decision, Michael Palestinian.
However, there is a secret to work with the controls.
First of all, you have to help them control.
On the other way, you will not come to you with you.
And then you have to give them a absolute, definitely sensitive service here.
And finally, you will have to tell you the truth with it to understand it.
The smaller company -- the largest company has to be able to do three things that you have to be able to be able to sell has to be fantastic -- you have to tell you with a fantastic control, and you have to tell you with a financial advanced school.
You know what?
We have been known to a only human being in the world that I can do, sell and look at the money.
There is no exist.
This is still not born yet.
We have evolved and look at the 100 companies in the world, Western Consense, Congress, Park, France, all the new companies -- Google Earth.
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common -- only one was entered by one person.
I took the word "Montan: but the word "The word "The "West 3.5 times.
He was not just when he started when I grew up.
No one starts a company alone.
And so we can create the community where we have flowers, who got from a little business of small business sitting in care, and they were going to get a little bit of the discussions who are doing for you, what someone did for this generation who talked about this kid, someone who is going to ask you, what do you need to do it?
What can you do it? Can you do it?
Well, can you see it? Can you look at the money.
"Oh, no, I can't do that, "I want you to go back to someone showed?
We have community.
Thank you.
And those who are helping us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the news, so we don't have a lot of knowledge to start to share the same public space.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my technologies in public space, with simple tools as a subject, plants and street.
These projects came out of questions like, how much would I pay my networks for their adventures?
How can we be able to pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment in a bad moment?
How do you share more remember of our buildings and understand our parents?
How do we share more of our hope to the short stores so that our communities can make our needs and street?
I live in New York and I'm love from New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New You are looking at New
My husband always found it with the giant robots that give you to the shortcuts and surgery and states from the side of a city and control in a city.
It's always given the music --  there's a development in New YouTube.  And the city has one of the most beautiful artists in the world, but also one with the largest amount of programmers in the United States.
I live close to this house and I thought how I could turn it into a more cool space for the bank and also in something that changed my life for always time.
In 2008, I lost someone who was looking a lot.
It was John as a mother for me.
His death was represented and experience.
I thought a lot about death.
And this made me a distributed program for the living time.
He gave the sensitive things of my life.
But you get to keep this look at my college life.
It seems to me that it's easy to leave it for the day to day and find the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old friends and new friends brought the wall of this house based in a giant pattern and I asked about it to be able to come back, before I die with me."
So they were able to take you to take a head, to take on their lives and share people in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment but the next day was represented and it was surprised with it.
And I'd like to share some things that people write on the wall.
"In order to die I want to be a particular partner for the partner --   "I want to sit to you in the line of the change of the change of the face."
"I want to die for millions of people.
"In order to die I want to pay a burn.
"In order to die I want to live outside the network."
"In order to die I want to give you one more time.
Before I die I want to go to the rest of somebody else.
"In order to die I want to be completely myself.
This space. This space will be able to control and the subjects of people made me go back to the careers, and they got me back to me, and they gave me in a difficult moment.
It's about knowing that one is not just -- it's about understanding our technologies in new ways and researchers. It's about giving up to the relationship and control -- and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started to get hundreds of message people who wanted to do a machine in their community.
And so with my colleagues of the clinical center we did a DNA and now they have been done in countries around the world, like Katts, Africa, African and beyond there.
So together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to explore and share it together.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationship with other people.
And in our age of discovery -- it's more important than I would never find the ways to get the perspective and remember that life is basic and developed.
The death is something that we often have to talk about, or even think, but I even understood that they will be able to focus for death is one of those things that are getting more power.
Think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can be able to make it better than we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope -- fear and stories and stories -- people who are going to help us not only help improve places can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So today I have a single particular.
I don't tell me that I'm a normal thing.
Now I would like to introduce you to my hands.
And I grew up about 24 years old, it's high and so forth.
I don't talk about, but I'm going to make it better than some of the best subjects.
I remember what the love.
And I was able to be able to put what happened.
It's not failure. I don't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about the differences and get them on this, it never means.
When you look at our infections, trying to build words that I didn't even know, I would remember one thing -- I remember a thing that we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that has to be what it needs to be.
Steve has 12 years old. It's very rapid.
It has the most exciting medicine.
However, it is a sensitive medicine.
I don't remember if I got my colleague, but I remember my year, but I remember the year when I came up with each of my computers, conversation that we did when I was four years old, you can make a little bit in my arm during the first species of Temperatures and the computer of Ladie Galaxy.
You don't look like incredible?
But most people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds don't get up to the control of the society.
But what I'm going to do with my heart and it was that even my show was that even if that was the case, even though I didn't think of the control, that could only mean one thing, which were extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and extraordinary and
Now, for those less family with the "The "The "Every "State "Excellent, it's a brain brain that affect social communication -- learning and sometimes to the physical skills to the physical computers.
In every individual in each of it is started in a different way of the way that I'm so different.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, and it's a new case of autism, and even though it is one of the development of the development that faster in the world, there is no cause and course and control.
I don't care about my first one of my first one of the audience, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When I was a few months, I realized that he was different.
I had a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me.
I was living in his own world, with their own rules -- with their own rules -- and I found it in the most small things, like putting the cars in the end of the room, and look at the land and eat anything that would have been in the media.
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made to be more entirely.
But beyond the benefits and the freedom and the individual health, there was something really unique -- a little bit of the antibiotics and antibiotics, a kid who sees the world without professionals, a human being had never mind.
Except experiment.
I can't notice that there have been some difficult moment in my family, moment in which I would have been supposed to be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about the individual -- the communication and love, and I realize that they are things that I didn't want to change by nature.
The nation goes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of it is wrong.
It only means that there's a different view of what it's right.
If I could take a single thing to Republic and San and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, authority or not, the differences that we have, and the differences that we have, every one of us has a day in their interest and simply, the surface of the nature is the last building of the power.
The opportunity for the big one, the progress and the change in the moment that we try to be like others.
I don't tell me that I'm a normal thing.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experience a little bit what has been being Africa in the country of the Valley.
Pennsylvania was asked me to me, a product of communication -- that I would give a kind of communication to the English students of English.
I was still.
But when they develop those conversations -- I felt what Africa has to have felt when I go through the hole of the context and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt at me when I had those conversation with the students -- I was surprised by the ideas that they had -- and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great community.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing the world.
Our scientists are the ones that are taking our biggest challenges -- from energy to the environment and care of the health.
But these big conversation can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
And so scientists and engineers, please go up with a simple.
And I want to share some sounds about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sex and their engineering is active.
The first question for response, and then what?
They give you why science is relative to us.
We don't tell us just that they study the territories, but they study the transportations, which are the mass structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and treat the electrons.
And when they are developing their science with the box.
The law is a obvious for our understanding of their ideas.
Second, you can say special and techniques, but why don't I say space and time, which is much more access to us?
You can do it is not the same thing that you can do this.
When he said English, which is all as simple as it's possible -- but not simple.
They can communicate their science without making the ideas.
So something to consider is to use example, stories and advances. They are ways to stop and use it with their control.
And when you put his work, they get out of the "sea seasons.
You have been asked why it's called "the "business" --  What do you do the baby? The bacteria kill it, and they kill their own.
And a picture like this is not just a back, but it gets too much in the area of the language of our brain and architecture us.
In change, this particular example of George German is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of workers is so strong that they actually inspired the only design of the Earth Earth.
The treatment here is to use a simple film, beautiful, that the public can understand if you look at a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the other sense and they create a more deep sense of understanding of what it was described.
I think these are just some key things that you can help us be able to help the door and look at the country of the words that is science and the engineering is.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have evolved this choice for all the media -- you know, they have a signal.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the National engineering of English English is "The "unit."
Just because it sounds very well.
And "The "now means police police."
Even though there was an average particular particular partner of the 20th century that he said that a lot of better when he said, "The "degree is that I would look at a public car without important particular paradigm, and that, when you get it, you get it by the top use of a relative meaning of a relative means.
I have no idea what it means in "the resource."
One thing to see with the words, I know.
It's very important that the words are the basis in political -- and that all the politicians know that they have to try to make the language.
It wasn't until that, for example, 1858 that the British Park allows the professionals to look at the working words that they were told in the food camera of it.
And all of this was because of the value of a guy with the name of Brazil Bang, who went into the Park.
He got up in the Talk of London and they got up, but he had the enough enough of them to get up to them, and at the end of the end had a particular support in London that they do.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the financial use of the financial survey -- and it's like the mind."
Most of you think it's limited.
It is. It's by a design of the freedom of experiment.
But to show you really how the words and political politics -- I want you to go back to the United States, right after the institution.
And so they had to take the question of how to call George Washington, his language.
They didn't know.
How do you call a line of a complete country.
And this is described in the Congress for a long time.
They had all sorts of sounds that could have been forced.
Some of them wanted to call it "Space China, and others -- "The George George Wall, and other Development Developments of the United States America.
It doesn't really get a lot.
Some of them just wanted to call it."
They thought that it was a quality problem.
And I don't even want to be mentally, they had the idea that you could be struggled by a particular particular.
And there could be service.
The whole world is seriously, because this degree was provided for three weeks.
And I was the day of a poor population, and I always wrote with this state.
And what I used to do is that the contract and it was that the name of Republic was in the Saturn of the Saturn.
The Carlos Carteria didn't want Chris to be able to power.
They didn't want to call it because I was going to go back to him or his own ideas.
So, they wanted to give you the most powerful technique, more meaning and more likely to be happened.
And that terror was President."
Professional. They didn't invented the terror.
It was like the price of a game.
And I didn't have much bigger than the terror "disease or "supermarket."
There had been a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of collective controls and grandfather faces, but it was really a meaning stage.
And this is why the Saturn gets up.
They said, "It's rich, we can't call it President."
"This guy has to be able to be treated and recognize with distributed discovery."
And who would take it on a series with a subject as rich and meaning like Protestant Project."
And finally, after three weeks of the destiny, the Saturn didn't go.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite until I have been able to figure out, the Saturn has never been represented in the team of Protein.
The British Bang Bang has been able to continue there, waiting to be in an action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is terrifying,  -- it possible that we are going to look at 24 years old.
But the third thing we can learn -- and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing I want to leave you, is that the U.S. Project of the United States doesn't sound as much model today, right?
And about everything if you have more than 500 percent of the neurons -- the biggest economy of the world and a force of the world is not transparent and others.
The reality.
So at the end of the side of the Saturn.
They had his resource of reality.
And also the other issue of the Seattle, the advanced angry, well, it was a sensitive for it.
But you know how many neurons are now present now?
And all of them because they want to sound like the guy who has the ones -- etc.
So, at the end of the World San and the camera of Republic lost -- because no one is going to feel human when they tell you that now are the United States.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn -- and what I'd like to leave you.
The politicians try and use the words to give it and control the reality, but actually, the reality is much more than the words that these things could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I am 45 to the end of the land in a military mine of Google.
The air is full of carbon and particular and it is hard to reduce it.
I feel the room of body bodies in the heart, but I can't see a lot more.
I have a few times that talk to you, but about all of that collection of marketing markets and paradigm with private tools.
As the others -- I took a lot of light light on the head with the head with this analytical space, and then I can be able to figure out the radio relationships that are going to be the walls of that hole of a metaphor that takes hundreds of meters on the land.
It was related to my hand and suddenly I remember a message that I met days before, which I lost the control and you put up in that point.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the top of that today today will give you their lives without pay and recorded and often decade.
I went out of that today, and I went home, but they may never do it, because they are present from the scale.
In the last 24 years I was doing natural culture in more than 80 countries in six countries, and in 2007, I had the great honor of being the only experiment in the Canada of the Park of the Park.
And among all the amazing people I met there I met to a "never the "The "The "The "The "The Telescope of "The Texas -- an AIDS that was supposed to make the modern system.
We started talking about the scale and really, I started to learn about scale because I knew that there is in the world but not just like a distance.
When we end up talking to me very bad -- he was trying to take this quality of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It was made to me a name and weeks later, I went back to the Nigeria to know the Death of "The "The "The "The Stage Texas and give me my help.
So I started my journey to modern science.
And I had been in many of these sites.
In some of them -- even I had the second home.
But this time, it was going to look at the health transportation.
A concept is saying that there are more than 24 million people in the world.
It is the day of the amount of African Africa during all the transformation of traditional control.
150 years ago, the cost of a corruption survey was about three times the flow of the U.S.
And the equivalent of a few percent.
However, today, you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go up with the friends of 1974 11.
And surprisingly, the survey would have a lot of more than a thousand billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of you have been familiar with a good education of good education and better work for then to figure out that they are forced to work without plant, under violence and they can't be able to work.
So today the supermarket supply in the computer, the good products are valued, but they are doing them are developed.
The survey is in almost all the world and yet it's general around the world.
In India and New North Angeles I met the bones of the balls.
This strange special and forest was like to go to the Earth European or the Internet of Daniel.
In a terrorist of 45 Colleges, men -- men -- men in fact, family families in a form of paper, and they have a lot of balloons in their head, to 18 to 18 to 18 to the time, and they take them out of the old hospitals that are hundreds of food.
And then they developed by the moment and the sound work in the signal, doing this task over and over and over 12 hours a day.
There were no particles to eat it, not to get up, and the destruction would see it would be a lot that would be quite interesting.
And so they were the car and the police that my camera became too close to the top and let me work.
Every 20 minutes I had to go back to the car to clean the team and make it work with the air and make it and sitting up there, and sitting there, I thought, my camera got a much better treatment than these people.
And then you go back in the hospitals I wanted to figure out, but the college that I was going to go to my side and he said to me and said, "Look, don't do it. You don't do it.
And I would explain very clearly that we will show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me.
I couldn't give you any right help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't a city of that country.
I could put it in a worse situation that they were already there.
I had to focus in "The "Times and work inside the system for their lab and I built that they would get it.
And I would like to get home to be home to feel my heart heart.
In the Higgs, I found children who are going to be able to take a little bit for miles for millions and lots of ways that they were waiting down.
Those big particles were more likely than the children who were giving them and the children put them up to their head with college careers made out of paradigms, right?
It's hard to ask something so admit.
How can we interact in something so influenced, but so so an extra supply of it.
Some of you don't even know that they are surgery -- and they work 18 hours a day without painting, because this has been all his life.
They don't have anything to share it.
And when these friends were including their freedom -- the research took up their house.
When the word the word often we thought about sex transportation, and because of this global consciousness I was able to be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Kenya, I got to get women who had been completely sexual self-assembly.
And I was told by a few of them who were going to take this room -- I had a subject of high light.
It wasn't exactly a battery.
It was a bit of a resource.
And it responds as you know in the office -- they are local for the private program.
They have a little bit of small partners, private controls, where the shows with their girls and children -- some of the only seven years -- they're forced to get the cars and to make it more food and control.
Every step is dark and health, increased by a particular number in the wall and discovered by a balloon and a control.
The workers often look at sex sea at hands of their car.
In the way, I remember to have felt a sense of antibiotics and in that interview, I was just able to imagine what it has to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I just had a street, the schools where I got in.
There were no warming partners.
There was no very big enough.
Those people don't have a space, and because we take a very difficult issue -- it's important to figure out that the scale, even the sex transport, happens to our around.
There are hundreds of people who are surprised in architecture -- in fact, in the developing service and the list can be able to get up.
Now, the New York New York Times that between 100 and 300 thousand children are coming around every year as sex sea.
It happens by the way, but we don't see it.
The terrorists are another activity that we often relationship with the hand of the way in the way in the way in the way that we have the way in the way in the way in the way that we have the way in the way in the way in the way that we were able to do with the way in the way in the way that we were
And I was able to be able to be able to go up with the industrial families in the middle of the room.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father of the book and red in their children.
They make them standard in these big balls and survive the sitting in the room to the core to the core and the transportation is tremendous.
My interest told me their stories.
We don't have a little bit of the discovery."
We still expect it, yet power will get out of this house and go to another place where we actually put our work.
And it turns out that there are more than 400 children who are surprised in the Ladie, the biggest side of the world.
When we came back, I went to take a quick view of it.
And I saw what it seemed to be a family family in a boat -- two weeks older -- some more young children -- it has sense right?
Earth. They were all surgery.
The children are sitting out of their traditional families -- destroyed and forced to work official with these bacteria in the lab -- despite not to know about it.
This child has eight years old.
And when our boat was able to get up with it, it was taken up that his little child was started.
I was ready by the fear of the water.
The risk of the traditional trees of the subject in the voice is often addressed and children and children, family and fear and fear of the water.
A lot of you will come down.
Since I remember, it's always been used to work on the side.
For fear of his love is not going to go and like the whole life has been treated with religion, transformed to the most young people under their mouth.
I met these guys at the five of the morning, when they were getting the last networks -- but they had been working from the one.
It was in the night and standards.
And it is going to be able to tell you that these networks spend more than 400 miles when they are full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kenya.
Korean was turned up in a village of fishing.
I met it in a relationship where "The San Texual there was the very straight village of the scale.
King supported the possible.
Who will get to be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
And I put up by a career in Google with "The States of "The "The Stages -- a computer company with their mountain of the anti-consciousness and survives our car and he took the window out.
It asked us to take it for a way of land to the surgery.
At the end of the way, I started getting out of the car and asked it to the control that would come wrong.
And then I was able to be able to be able to be seen and said, "This is the path -- this is the path -- let's go on.
And as we started to work, we took the anti-construction and after walking close to one hour we found that the way that the way was controlled by the restaurant resources, so I put the team of pictures on my head as we go up in these days to the shoe.
After two hours of walking -- the single way I ended up in a car, and we had a map of holes that could happen in a field field -- and all of them were full of solar workers in the stage.
A lot of women had children taken up to their paradigms, and as they were looking at the short water, they walk in water with marketing.
The market is used in the process.
These guys are used in a piece in the other part of Google.
When they came out of the piece they were sitting in their own surgery.
I remember that he looked at his eyes called the children, benefits, because a lot of had been under the land for 24 hours.
The parents have up to 90 meters and these people are able to take a little bit of sure that then they will be treated to another area where they will take the street to be able to be able to get the original.
First of all, the site seems to be full of forms and virus, but if we look at more of us, we can see to work to others less likely and too.
All of these are violent visuals and violence.
In fact, it is very likely that this machine ended up like this video of war and the investment in a few years old.
This is Mars. When he died his father his father was going to work with him in the feet.
When you die his top, Maria has been the idea of the whole thing that force it to be survey in the feet.
When I met it, I had worked in the last 14 years and the law of the list that you see here is a product of an audience in the minute, so great than the doctors said that I should be able to be.
In addition to that, Marine has terrorism, and not obvious to that, it's forced to work at night and day in that me.
Even like this, he knew that he was going to be light and education with local activities like "The "The South Texts -- and it's this kind of design, and it is this kind of definition, and what I was inspired by a lot of answer.
I want to make light on the scale.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
And I wanted you to know that we would make sure that we will be able to do it and we will do all possible to help change their lives.
I just believe that if we can look at each other as human beings as human beings -- then it makes it very hard to be able to take access as the scale.
These images are not from resources. They are people, real people like you, and like me, that you can look at the same rights in their lives.
There is no day that I did not think about these so many beautiful people, marriage, which I've had the great honor of know.
I hope that these images are going to take a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force comes up with a fish and that then it goes up with a field of light and that new light on the scale because without that light, the center of the solar can continue to live in the surgery.
Thank you very much.
And I make a particular material and there is a particular problem for you to do it, we are kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of like the control controls.
No one knows what we do.
So I'm trying to try to explain to you what I do.
The biology is one of the most human activity.
They give us the virus of the back and the correlation of correct --  that we will see more around.
But the bacteria made a distribution of extraordinary understanding -- a high level of destruction and probably a little bit of an amazing thing that can have a genetic company.
Later, the black translations like the Mars of Paris will be able to be able to be able to make this extraordinary ability -- as I do with my friend Japan that in his time, was a virtual vision of back.
In the last few years it has become a lot in the treatment.
However, there are 8,000 million people in the world who are sensitive and they have to deal with an amazing thing, straightforward and other students of this disease, so we need tools to stop the disease.
We need to be able to measure the product in the power and in defense, the only way we know if there really is a culture to be when we have an object and care collection.
But it's final that for the Paris and others of the movement of the movement there are no biological markets, so they don't get the blood anti-activities and the best thing that we have is a national number of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a culture to do that. It's very, very expensive -- and that means that it was from the clinical trials -- they never do. It's never done it.
And what if the patients could do it in life?
That would save a diagnosing journey to the climate -- what if patients could do the experiment themselves.
You don't need to be people.
By the way, it costs about 300 in the national culture.
And so what I want to ask you as a way not to be able to try to understand it, you see, in a certain sense at least -- all of us are seen as my friend Jane Steve.
So this is a video of the violence of the virus careers.
It shows someone as a few of you know how to talk about, and we can imagine how to talk about, we can be able to recognize all of those local organisms to produce sound and all of us have the needs need to be able to need it, for example.
And like the bacteria, it requires an extraordinary level of extraordinary behavior.
We think about time that leads to a child to learn to talk about.
In front of the sound -- we can be able to develop the position of the local bodies as they fly up, and as the Paris affect the explorations, also affect the local oceans as well.
In the box of low you can see an example of the line of the value careers.
We see the same states.
It takes a value and relative and religion.
The design becomes more transforming and spending after a while, and this is an example of the systems.
How do you share these experiments based on the voice with the control context with the special consequences -- well, both of them are not investment.
The black task is not individuals. both of us use the existence of it.
It's not need to design a whole series of hospital to do it.
both of them are present. Okay, but also the experiments based in voice not specifically.
I mean, they can be a spirit.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are a money and we all know what happens.
When something happens to be a cost as far as it comes to a massive scale.
So these are some amazing metals to be able to get up.
And we can reduce the particular distributions of the patients.
I would not be able to go to the color for the robot carbon.
And with the death mortality we could get a little bit.
We could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to come up with a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking at the first discussions of the disease before it is too late.
So when I give the first few countries in that sense, we're putting the Language Rose of Paris.
And because of San And Palestinians, we want to reduce a lot of times around the world to reduce enough data and start to make these object.
We have local lines for about 75 million people in the world.
Anyone, with or without Paris, you can call it down to the presentation and let me go up by a few cents -- and I was able to find that we've already taken six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   And I took Rome Richard, so Mars, taking all of these shows -- we say 10 people -- you can say who is safe and who right?
What about these shows?
Mars Line, yeah, yes, what happens is that during the call you have to be able to figure out if you have or not the disease.
MR: You see, some people can not afford it. It may not take it.
But we're going to get a very large show of different data in different colleagues, and do it in different creatures is important because we're looking at the flag factors in the size of the reality of the disease.
TR: Do you have a 75 percent of printer in this moment at this moment at this time.
MR: A lot more than that.
In reality, my student Test, I have to put it, has done a fantastic work -- and now it has shown that it works in the mobile network also, also what the project. Now we have a 99 percent chance to do.
TED: Nobody and again. Well, it's a better.
MR: Of course.
TED: Thank you very much.
MR: Thank you.
Before I was in the middle of 2010, I was made photographs in the city of New York.
We are completely profitable crisis, graphics.
We are going to tell us in the heart, and you have no views, and by the way, we take the solar light.
We do the moral models still more likely -- the perfect skin still more likely to do the most perfect thing, and we are going to trust us all the time all the time, but some of us are really art with a lot of years of experience and a real thing for the images and the picture.
The 18 percent of the 20th of the 2008, I saw from my house -- as the rest of the world, the rest of the things that happened in Japan
A long time later, an organization where it was value, there was the Virginia Rose, was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other values we knew that we can't be able to be sitting in home, so I decided to get to the group for three weeks ago.
The 18 percent went to Australia.
It is a little bit of particular fishermen in the University of almost 50 people, one of the first one of the first people who are working through the ocean.
The level of water water took up more than 24 feet away and more than three miles into it.
As you can imagine, the village was discovered.
We were able to get out of the streets and the boxes.
We leave schools -- we take the side and let's take the ready house to be religious and research.
We were able to take a forest and force forests, and accountable from the local forest.
And we found it and we love it.
For weeks as long as the cells found similar things.
They found pictures and terrorists of pictures and cameras and cars and cars.
They all did the same thing.
And you can take them to them and take them to different places of the people around them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures would represent a huge part of the people that people who had supposed.
As you go out of the car, and to save their lives, they had to be able to be able to be able to get all the things they had to do.
At the end of my first week I started to help it in a concept of the world.
It helped change the basic community backs the huge backs, grandmothers go.
This place it turns out to be also the place of the village where the center of the energy is going to take the picture.
And there was the horizontal and I had the hope that that day they trust me in me to make the pictures of the picture.
This was exciting and interactive, I had heard the experiment to think beyond the hospitals, but it was not until I was not until the same thing that something happened.
When you look at the pictures -- I found some of them that had more than a hundred years of a few years were still in the lab -- I couldn't be able to be able to think about how to fix that role and replace that robot and I met hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night in Facebook came in Facebook with some of them, and at the next morning, the answer was so additional and positive, that I knew we had to understand it.
So we started to recognize the picture.
This was the first of all.
I was not too much, but where the water had taken up the face of the girl I had to deal with a lot of presentation and developed.
On the other way, that girl would not have the kind of it, and that would be as critical as having the professional picture.
With the past of time, they came through more pictures and they needed more relationships so that I will go back in Facebook and Linus and five days later than 80 people from 12 countries were able to help.
At the age of two weeks I had 150 people who are trying to get in.
In Japan in Japan -- we moved to Richard, a black place to the North Caradol.
Once we use our way we use our season in the temperature photographs that had been influenced, where people were going to reduce their picture.
The time that they were trying to give you is a different story.
I could imagine a hour. I could be able to be able to imagine weeks out.
I could imagine months.
So this mind had to be able to draw by hand by using as the areas of the areas that color and destroyed the water had no destruction.
I took a long time.
And the water shows all of these specific pictures in water water, college boats, with some of them -- all of it is all over the step of the time that I know about the point of time, and so you take them to hand was a very important part of the project.
We could not recognize the picture at least that I was clean, and it would have been related to his body.
We had a little bit of the impact to hand.
We met with the water of a complete technology.
It is very easy to say even more than the pictures of them.
As I said once I said Britain, the leader of my group is like to make a terrible.
You can't be able to do surfaces.
The woman who brought us up with these pictures of these pictures had a relationship to the picture.
I had started to figure out about it, but it was supposed to realize that it was even more.
I also had death.
without them, the images of his wife and their own face would not be able to be able to be able to grow up, we could take the images in a single picture and reduce the whole picture.
When I remember their pictures to share something of his story with us.
A few colleagues of their wife found the pictures in a set of legs between the very far shoes of where it used to be his house, but their colleagues would remember it.
The day of the translation, his husband was the ability to close the banks to the ocean.
I had to go inside the water as the surgery would sound out.
Their small children -- not so small now, but their two children were in the colleague, in different ways.
One of them started in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that everybody had been survived.
The day that I put up their pictures his own son say about 14 years old.
For it, despite all of this, those pictures were the best radio that I could do it, something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember the past that would not have been made by that day in the day when everything in their life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1960 had been taken up to the Hawai Hawaifers of them were helping us to make it more than 150 degrees -- the big photographer -- the big majority came to hands of their dreams -- important.
More than 500 parts of all the world helped us go back to 90 years of different pictures of profitable photos and religious.
For this time, we really don't spend more than 10 in terms and materials -- most of them in terms of survival.
We take pictures of it.
A picture is a piece of someone or something, a place -- a relationship -- somebody else.
They are drugs of our resources and stories -- the last thing we were going to look at but the first thing we would go back to see.
And this was about the project of a little bit of a little bit of humans, to take someone their connection with the past.
When a picture of this is a picture like this, I know a huge difference in the life of the person that I got it.
This project also took a big difference in the life of the relationships.
Some of them told them with something bigger with something bigger -- using something for something that will not be models of a perfect skin paradigm.
In order to end up to just read this exploration corner, I sent it back the day I came from Japan after six months.
As I reached it, I could not be able to think about people and the stories show in the images.
One of them in particular -- a picture of different areas from the grandmother to a small girl to the little little girl to the little little girl -- I got to me, because a similar picture of my family -- my mother, my mother, and my daughter was noticed from our wall.
In the entire world, in all of our basic needs are the same thing, right?
Thank you.
Dan Congress is an amazing thing with this picture of a bacteria that was going to take a man in an experiment of just a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go over a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a thousand billion dollars per second.
I put you a new kind of photograph, the face, a new technical news that can create video videos in the light of the light.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the religions, beyond the line line -- or see the inside of the body without using the bottom of the bottom -- and they are actually the idea of camera of it.
If you take a place to go and put it into a second of the second or standard, in a number of seconds to create a piece of pictures of the fish of a million and a half of the airplane.
And that piece of pictures -- that battle, to go back to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bank.
If we take that bacteria and this piece of pictures and we described in this battle, how are those pictures within this back?
What is the kind of light of light in love called the light?
Now, all of this,       I remember that all of this happens at least in less than a night is what I love to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times as far as you can see the light in movement.
College did not have this research --  -- a lot of things in this film -- to give you this information to show what is going on.
And the particular, our balloon, in the boat with a piece of pictures that start to take it to you and that, in the end of it -- it starts to describe.
You know, part of the light goes back to the table -- and we started looking at these institutions.
So many of the pictures are finally coming to the top, and then they explore in several direction.
As you can see, there is a piece of air that goes in the environment.
In that time, the bees go through the table and because of the records of the right part is looking at the bottom of the ball, after several paradigms, that the resources are going on.
Now, if we took a common and correlation and we make the same distribution and we do it in love with about 10 billion times, how many of you think we would make us feel to see that film?
One day, a week?
It would be a very high film --  -- of a white leg in movement in movement.
And what about transportation with nature?
You can see the instants that are coming out of the table and the wall of the forest.
It's how to make a street in a street.
It's the way that nature makes a picture -- I thought, from a picture at the time, but of course, our eyes see an amazing company.
But if you look at one more time, you will realize that, as the light gets out of the task, it goes out of the task, you don't know.
Why? Because the size is market and the red light in his interest and then come back after a number of thousands of second.
In the future, when this photograph is in their mobile movements, you're going to go to the surface and will be able to get up if the oil is often married without having to take it.
So what do we create this camera in MIT?
As a pictures -- you know, if we take a picture to a picture of experiment, in very short light.
But we're going to go through a billion times faster than the most short thing, so I just got to get some light.
We made that book, and we took that battery, millions of times, millions of times, and we took over and over again, and we take those diagnosis of data and we take them completely to create those females that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in trust and test them in interesting ways.
They can be able to fly up.
And others can be able to come back.
And if a new power of a solar future would allow me to see after the religion?
The idea is that we could make a light of light on the door -- Remember, going to the room -- a part is going to get up in the door and from there to the camera to the camera.
And where we could be able to explore those marketing markets of light.
It's not effective. We've already built it.
On the left, it's our food.
And behind the wall there is a market and we will take the light on the door there.
And then from the role of our audience in North Community.
And a small factor of the pictures will go back to the camera but closed, in the very different time.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our factory, it has the only ones that are one of them.
It has very good technology and you can look at the world to the speed of light.
So we know the designers up to the door and also to the dark objects but we don't know what I'm going to happen to what it is.
And by building a plant you can take a picture of a picture -- which you see in the screen -- you really don't have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images and we're going to take them and try to look at the local relationships of light, and with that, we can see the right object of the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
This is our resource.
We have things to explore before I was going to take this out of the lab -- but in the future, we could create cars that are considered with what is going to the back of the culture.
Or we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at the red light by the open sides.
Or we could be able to be able to be able to look at the inside of the body by getting surgery, and the same for care.
But of course, because of the terror and the blood is pretty difficult -- so this is really hard -- so this is a question to the scientists so that they start thinking about physics as a new model of vision to solve the problems of energy in the next generation of the next generation.
So like Darwin Congress, he became a scientific science, and it turned up the science in art, an art art art art.
I realized that all of the data of data that we remember are not just for scientific visual videos -- but we can.
It will create a new form of computer photograph with food camera and color color.
And we look at those instants. You remember the time between each of those installations is just a few billion dollars.
But here it also happens something different.
If you look at the degrees under the water, these are coming from us.
The bees should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we are taking almost to the speed of light, we have extra effects at the end of the left would have been looking at this picture.
The order to happen in the world in the world sometimes it looks at the camera at the time.
And so I was able to figure out the space of space and time, we can take this direction.
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell can change life, and you give you an individual discovery.
With a cell can make a control against the humanity in San.
With a cell you can take a message and get a professor in Europe.
With a cell you can take a care, it can be able to go back to San and make a family.
This is all possible.
I'm a Chinese Chinese and living in the city of Berner.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were working out of a change.
So this is the ocean of Zealand, imagine if all these people who are present in a change of a change, they had a cell in the battery.
Who of the presentations have a cell here?
Let's look at them.
Let me take their mobile movements, they read them.
Let's look at them, a Bangladesh, a guy, good."
It's a lot of all of us today have a mobile level.
But today I'm going to talk about me, from my mobile -- and how I changed the life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 lines of information.
data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2007, the Earth of the Earth, I had a distance.
The Decision of Daniel Decades.
And this slide says that every single phone company says that every single physical company of the entire Europe, and it has to be able to make a lot of information of information in the use.
Who I called who I took an issue to who a stage to who a stage to who I send up a stage to who I send up with who a stage to who I send a stage to who I send a stage.
And who sent him a fear to who he taught him about.
And if we use the mobile -- where we are.
All of this information is made by at least six months, and until two years, in his phone company or his own principle of the Internet.
And in all of Europe the people came up and said, "We don't want to do this.
They said they didn't want this piece of data.
And we want to be able to be able to do the digital and we don't want the phone and the Internet proteins are taking all this information about us.
There were a correct, specialist, controllers, everybody said, "We don't want to do this.
And here you can see a few billion people who came to the streets of Bill and they said, "Let's not tell you, "Don't tell you, "Don't tell you.
And some even said that this would be the San Santa.
The United States was the secret policy of America America.
And I also asked me if this works.
Can you take all this information about us?
Every time I use the molecule?
So I asked my phone, Steve Television, which in that then was the largest phone company of Germany, which per family would send me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them one time, and I came back to them, and I did not get a common answer -- I was all basically, back.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're putting my life.
So I decided to give you a common discussion because I wanted to have this information.
But Steve Tennessee said no, we don't give you this information.
At the end of the end we look at a career.
I would go back to the distance, and they would send me the information that I thought about.
And as a lot of the Consequence Consequence American takes the increase for the analogy of the Arab of the U.N.
So I got this film on the market with a Christmas with a Colorado.
And in the context there was this.
And it turns out and five miles of information.
At the beginning I saw them and I said, well, it's an enormous article. Okay.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this article.
It was a bit survey, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am -- where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information.
I want to make it happy.
Because I want to show you the people what the data of data.
So, along to Arabic English and Art Darwin did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can be able to be able to go back and go back and go up and go back.
You can see every step that I go.
And you can see how I go from Facebook in three to Congress, and what I call it in the trade.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she called me a couple of times.
And then I call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this great network of communities.
You can see how their people are communicate between each time you call a few to each other, what time they do.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society because you know who I talk to who, who would give you a species to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is taken at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said to the beginning, you imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the middle of Ministry -- they had a cell in the battery.
And the States had heard who put in this project, and if the States had heard of who the leaders were had never happened.
The Middle East, maybe I had never happened.
And in the way, I was not at the top of the College Congress.
Because today in the day and the companies want to take so much information from us as it possible in and it was in the area.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to take them for always for time.
But the attack and live in the digital was not a control.
But today you have to go through the attack.
You have to go through that at the time.
When you go home to your friends that the private is a value of the 20th century, and it's not going out of the way.
When you go home -- they give you your answer that just because the companies and the students can make a certain information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company -- what information will make from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile videos that are used to remember that they have to go through the authority in the digital way.
Thank you.
Hollywood TV: What happened?
It's not enough.
Hollywood TV: What happened?
And I call me Mars American and I'm not brain, but I know the doctor I brought to the world.
I cut up to my mom six times in six different direction.
As a result of it, I have a brain particular, so I have all the time.
Look at it.
It's a street. I'm like a metal method of Santan's Santa.
And Marineba Congress.
The Panda.
It's not control and you can't get it.
No one would take the third of my mother and I don't know it because my parents were first survey, even though they are.
It just happens by the audience, like the one that happened to me.
Now, I'm going to give you -- I'm not a source of interviewing -- and I don't want any of the price to me.
It feels bad for me, because in some point of life, you've wanted to be discussing.
Let's go out of it.
So Letter Palestinians, are in the medical center -- they get on college controls and what do you look like?
I was 12 different places for discussion.
And you think, God, I can be at least a little bit disappeared."
In addition to them, I tell you, I have 99 problems and Palestinian.
So there is a company of the approach, I would take the surgery out of it.
I'm a professional, market, women, discovery and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park Prototypes, in New Jersey.
I always love that my bank and my disease.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York -- I could it.
A lot of people with brain particles don't walk up, but my parents don't believe in the can't be able to believe it.
The way my father was, "You can do it, back to the stage."
If my three weeks later, I was coming up.
If my three weeks were going to the public school, my parents were doing the solar system, and they had to make sure that I would also go out, and if we didn't get all of the way we all got the short of my mother in my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years to connect my tables in their feet and just walking up.
Another news that I used was to take a dollar in front of me so that I could do it.
The surface that I took inside was a very strong thing.
Yes, the first day in the discovery of the infrastructure was walking as a bit of black that has got a lot of forests.
When I grew up, there were only six robots in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 rollers, and they keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we were not negative.
This was before the 1980s, and that the politics would think of used to use "The "Music to make "Most of the campaigns.
The people who grew up didn't have problems with my family.
You don't know, it seemed to be able to be able to make a lot of man during the rain.
I told you that I had enough enough to live three months old without food, so they will help you look at it is very easy.
Bang up in Brazil.
Yes, in Brazil. It's collaboration.  My parents could not pay the physical phone, so I was going to the high school school.
I learned to draw with the colleagues, or I can walk with the control.
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be a girl -- so if my friends were going to use teachers, I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the sea shoes in the cost of Japan, I wasn't going to happen.
I was going to be my legs in a war of war, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestinian all the seconds, we would become Mars.
And in the same way I was going to look at my father trying to get up, so I was able to get out of the career, and I put me up with the Mount Monterey, and I remember that the water took me the eyes and I thought, "Well, I work.
But the military culture was the optimist.
I have to say that it is very drug, but before I do it was a supermarket control that could not be able to be able to put it out of it -- and I could be able to be able to put it out of the step.
And now I can go on the head.
My parents were given this idea that I could do anything that I could do anything -- that no dream was impossible and my dream was to be in the Hollywood Hollywood Tennessee.
I went to the university of the positive design and I got a book for the U.S. University, the state of the South America, because I was going to go in all the cars.
And it was like the market face of the terrible design.
They all love me.
I did all of the tasks of the less intelligence -- it comes up with the market in my class -- and also in their class too.
And every time I did a school of the control of the control of my teachers that I was going to do.
But I had never got a paper.
And finally, in my last year, the USB decided to make a word called Brazil very far in Japan.
It's a work of a girl with a brain particular.
I was a girl with a brain particular.
And so I started giving the four versions, "The end will have a parent."
I have a brain power.
At the end of the book."
Thank God very much as a book."
I didn't get the role --  they gave him to San Brazil.
I went to respond to the direction of the transportation of the terrible destruction, controlled story, as if someone had taken my grandmother, to ask me why and she told me that because they think it could not do the risk of risk here.
And I told him, "Well, if I can't do the risk of risk -- you can't do the context."
It was a role for that I literally had been born and they gave it to a brain without a brain.
The college was looking at my life.
Hollywood has a little story of giving them a story of distributed discussions for distributions.
When I went home, I went back home, and my first act was as a strange in a terrorist.
My dream became reality.
And I knew that it would be a low friend of "colleagues in a sense.
In change, I went there like a book, I don't see more than the night, and it was an evidence for me that the resources of resource would not be able to get a really high activity, not back with distribution.
They just connected to perfect people.
But there were exploration to the rules.
I grew up looking at White Google, Rome Bang, and all of these women had one thing in common -- were actually.
So I made me high.
And in my first day I took a famous face in New York to New York to New York to New York to New York -- and I would never forget the face of the first school that I was going to the street of New Francisco with a control that had a brain particular particular.
I worked in colleagues of everything in the United States, and also in the United States in the United States, with no control and no sense.
Some people say that I'm the first message of the Arab world.
I never like to raise the first place, but I know I never heard that little rain room that says that women are not fun.
In 2008, my brother of another mother and father -- Deliba Arabia, and I was able to take the Philadelphia Project in New York -- now in his 10 years.
Our goal was to change the national image of the college in the media in the media in the middle of the communication and to remember them to the resources of resource that survival and robots are not we know.
It was going to go to robots was much more easy to fight against the challenge of the distribution of distribution.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as I was invited by the program of news. It looks at Katrina with Kenya Allend.
I will go as if it went to a group of dialogue, I was told to a study and they sat in a street of risks.
I looked at the director and I said, "Well, you can give me another side."
She looked at me and he said, "Finder, four three, three, three, three, two, three, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three,
And we were in life."
So I'm going to get up to the spirit of the principle for not to get out of the screen for the side, and when I ended up the interview, I was particularly.
At the end I had my opportunity and the destruction. I knew that they didn't get to send it out.
But not just the Dr. Art came back to me, but I was going to go up with a particular time and I took my side.
One fun thing that I learned in the direction with Kenya Walk was that people in the Internet are scale.
It says that children are crossing, but it never got out of me or a little bit of more.
And in fact, my diversity in the Internet became object on the Internet.
I looked at the line with companies like, "Why do you take it."
It's recorded."
And my family, "Paper bank banks.
What disease is it?
We should actually be able to hear for you."
A control would sound even that I would go up with my distribution to my career, character, control, collection.
The diversity is as visual as the heart.
If someone in the street of robots can't do from Berner, then Ballying can't make someone in the room of risks.
The designers are the things -- yes, you know, man.
We are all the largest mind of the world, and the most sophisticated in the world of the world.
The doctors said I didn't walk up, but I'm here from you.
However, I would have grown with the media media -- I don't think it was.
And I hope that together we can create more positive images of diversity in the media and in the collective life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that would be less likely in the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has taken me to very specific places.
I came to walk through the red red forest by the day of the Twitter Santa and the Roman Rosetta Arab.
I got to act in a film with Al San Santa and to work with my day, the incredible Day David David.
I remember the world finished the world and they have come back to the world."
I was developed in the resource of the great state of New Francisco in the University of 2003, 2008,
And I went up with the children of Manson: an original organization to give the children related to a part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father looked at me in life, and I put this talk to his medication.
So it was a particular part.
I call me Mars America, and if I can, you can.
I would like to tell you a story about a little bit of a small brain.
I don't know his name -- but I know your story.
I live in a little village in the South South.
This is close to Mexico.
And it takes the subject to a little bit of the poverty and the bottom of the industry.
With nothing for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, Montana, the collection of Saturn.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities -- there is no work, no work of future.
He ended up living in a field in the city to the outside of Montana.
And after maybe one year again, nothing.
One day you have a day that tells him to take it to the movie, after I was going to be able to take it back to it, and then I was going to deliver.
I know a group of people, which gives you a decade.
I got a little bit of money so that it became a new one, money to send home to your family.
They present a young thing.
It's finally house.
It starts a new life.
It has a life.
A beautiful day in Montana, under a blue sky -- it is a car car.
That little child of that little population of the great quality was the surface terrorist, and that group of people who were to the Santa, a typical organization with the Lake.
So how do the story of a little child of a little video trying to make their dreams in the city end up with him.
He was waiting on.
I was waiting for an opportunity -- waiting to start their future, waiting a source of future, and this was the first thing he came out.
This was the first thing we call the "display of wait."
And his story is represented in urban center around the world.
This is the story of the markets, young books that are designed in Johnson, and they have distributed in London, which are looking beyond the power of species."
For the young people, the big dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity of work, and the young people don't pay in the product of their cities.
It is often the galaxy that comes from the most high tasks of design.
So for 2007, three of every five people living in cities will be less than 18 years.
If we don't even include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the story of the power of species, the policy of access to technology, to the virus, to the school, to be the story of the city.
And in my city -- Montana, 70 percent of the young people are designed.
70 percent doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to Montana last month -- and I went to visit the Middle East, the hospital where I was born in.
I remember to be to that hospital hospital to think about, and if I would never have been going to be gone?
And if I had seen me to be in that same power period of hope?
Would I have become terrorists?
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in Montana that month was actually to move to a few young leaders in a social car.
It goes up to about 90 percent.
We felt and we had a translation of ideas about the great challenges that are going to be the city.
One of the young people in the room was attention.
He went to the University of Montana, it was graduated.
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a definition control, designed, was the private white book for the Santa and other terrible organizations to be responded.
They had people like it.
But this story takes a different way.
In Montana, the biggest thing to get out of the point at the point is the street.
The seven years of civil war have developed the living system, and a drug can be the most easy way to move down.
You see an opportunity and the control.
He started a market company company company company.
It started active measurements to the local resources who were usually not able to buy them.
I bought 10 minutes, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is in some moment to explore hundreds of monkeys for the next three years.
Why is it different to this story.
What do you do to this different story.
I think their ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
This is the social spirit and I think the social spirit can be the most powerful tool against the power of hope."
And I found people to be the consciousness of the economic opportunities that are looking so designed.
And you can train the young people in order to be trust.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my restaurants, Monterey Monterey, a face.
I was helping to get to some of the young people in the middle of the social industry and how it will be investing and how to create a culture of the social industry.
In fact, it's the first face that Montana has seen in more than 24 years old, and until Mars came up, if you wanted food to you -- if you wanted to be forced for your boat, we were used to be able to send out from the experience.
If you asked somebody to somebody else, when was the last time you see flowers from financial?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be not a needed."
So Monterey saw an opportunity.
He started a company of photographs and flowers force.
I created a graph in the outside of Montana, and I started to close terrific and limitations and stages, who would be able to solve the climate car of Montana.
And I started the energy in front of them, creating boats in the house, and the companies of the city -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public part of Montana in 24 years.
There are no public parts in Montana.
It wants to create a space where families -- young people, you can go together, and as he says, you know, it will be able to hear the private forests.
By the way, he doesn't be controlled because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to interact the young people, and in that room, the Prize Project had a really deep impact in young people.
They had never thought about a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, their innovation really had a very important part about them.
And I will look at your city as a place of opportunity.
And I got them to believe that they could be constructing that they could be architecture of change.
For the end of the day, they had no international solutions for some of the biggest challenges that I face the city.
And they had solved solutions for local problems.
So, I will interact to young people and create a culture of social space is really a great step -- but the young young people need to make their real ideas.
They need experience and organization to put them into the development and put it in the market of their business.
They connect the young people with the resources that you need to be able to get the support that they need to get out of the control to creating it, and they can create care for the urban growth.
In order to me, the social space is something more than to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Monterey is not just looking at flowers.
I think it's looking for hope.
The Park of Passage, this is how I call it, when it is created when it's created the way people see their city.
And they go up with children from the street to help his short and keep the mountains for him.
I gave them the opportunity to get out of the power of the poster power."
These young people are having a huge impact in their cities.
So my surface is, you turn to the young young people in conservation, including and feed their international innovation -- and they have more stories about flowers and parts of the Park that reveals and "Pattern person."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went up with my father in the Manhattan Mansonical mountains, an area of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
And the forest is conversation.
The sun was made to be a virtual stage, and it's not going to be for the way we said, almost we could be able to figure out that we were the first human beings in taking that land.
We got to our food.
It was a collection in a relationship with a beautiful side when I discovered something wrong.
So behind the collection there was a street, from about four feet ago with metal careers of market paradigms and coming down.
And it was an anti-conscious, and I was very constructed and incredibly constructing it.
The companies that were too useful to get out of what they had brought up, who thought I was going to take your face?
And that question came up with me, and it turned out a little bit.
Who care about our face?
No matter how to organize or where you put the "Every "new one of our back in Stanford?
Who care about our back in Robert or in Park or in London?
Here in New York -- the Decision of San Saturn called our face, at the age of 18 tons of evidence and two tons of products all the day.
I wanted to tell you as individuals as individuals
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel to use the universe and take that car?
So I started a research project with them.
I worked in the camps and walk through the professors and I came to people in office and instruments in the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an instrument.
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a computer control.
Now I didn't just work in the cars. I got them up.
And I was able to put up the marketing and the neighborhood of it.
It was a private note and an amazing thing.
All of them ask about the chip.
It's there, but it's not as soon as they believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you get very quickly.
It costs a lot of access to the floor.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies are going to get down to the weight of taking about their body to take all of the weeks in front of every week.
It's also the dangerous.
And I remember with the North States of the Republicans of resources is one of the most dangerous explorations of the country, and I learned the right.
You are coming out and find it all day every day and they go down to your around.
They just want to go up, so in general the control is not getting attention to it.
That's very bad for the work.
And also the back of it is full of drugs that often get out of the walk and they have a terrible day.
And I also learned about the face of the back.
When you get out of the car and you see a city from the top of the room, you have to understand that the back is like a force of nature in it.
I never stop coming out.
It's also like a way of responsibility or criminal.
It must always be in movement.
And it's also the stage.
It looks like the state is especially antibiotic because I believe that the resources of resources are the most important way in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
These are the first public health.
If you don't get out of the effects in the energy and effective every day, this starts to develop their colleagues and their intelligence dangerous to us in very real ways.
diseases that we had control for decades and century will go back and they start to give you.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get out of the old thing that we don't have space for what the mouths of the economy start to do when it is in the control of the computer.
I'm not going to go through the carbon, just just your relationship of it.
And then there is what I call our average speed for our average life.
And I mean just to the speed to the speed that we used to move on the time in the time.
We really don't worry about us -- we don't go up, and we came up with us or we took with us with us of our card, our back of the markets, our water books.
We use them, we would take them out of them, because we know that there is a work of work in the other side that is going to come from it.
So today I want to hold you a couple of ways to think about the resources that maybe help us reduce the structure and get them in that conversation about how to design a solar and human city.
His work, I think, is almost a little bit of a little bit.
They are in the street every day, in a really relative way.
They use a birth in a lot of cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work allows us to do the us.
They are almost a form of food.
The flow that they keep us in front of ourselves -- of our own devices, our own devices, and that flow always must keep it in a way or another.
And one day after the 12 percent of 2005 2000s, I heard the grandmother of a way of resources in the street -- I'm going to go to my little son and he went up with a little bottom and he had a man doing his traditional relationship of paper as I did all the microscopes.
And I tried to give you to make her work that day in particular -- but I started to come in.
And I looked at me, and I just looked at me, and he said, "We are going to be good.
We're going to be good."
A little bit after that, I started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see that man.
It's called Park, we work together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be good.
But in our forces to recognize the way we have in this planet as a species we have to include and have to get all the cost -- even the very real human cost of the way in the way.
And the medical resources, what we think of when we talk about the short number of the amount of risk of the national neighborhood.
It is a national structure.
So in the flow of his days and their lives, the next one that you see someone who is working to do is to take the back of you, and you get a moment to get them to them.
It was a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the context of thinking about our computer life by thinking about the environment of the environment where the architecture was born from the control and local transformations.
Today, I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
both of these projects are sitting in the environmental countries -- one in Earth and the other in Tanzania.
It also share the fact that the different ones from different people are becoming a very essential part of the end of the attention.
The first example started with an investment to design a commercial center of several countries in the contraction of the European Carilism, Arab Australia.
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example -- my team and me, about what we had to design with.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out."
After you see some of these buildings there are a lot of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important species to resource.
In the beginning, these buildings are almost values because they have very big stores that people can't give the order to buy things.
Second, you need to take a lot of energy because of the control with college generations in the environment, so it's need a lot of institution.
In a city where this should not happen because it's about a terrible climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the year.
And on the third place, his point doesn't have anything to do with Africa or English.
It's a piece of a place that is so rich in culture.
In our first view to Europe, I was really central with the market industry that is this structure at the top of the book, where thousands of people, and they buy things all the day to little views.
And there is also that idea of using public space to make an extra space.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design -- not a critical center of it.
But the question was how to build a building model.
The next challenge was asked to interact the site -- which is present in a lot of a lot of a much growth of the city where a lot of the buildings we now see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two places that don't communicate in a sense of hundreds of hundreds of food.
So the first thing that we did was to create a connection between these two streets -- getting all of the beginning of the building.
And this is explored with an increase that creates a space at the top of the book in the building that goes up, by their own way, the sun and the face.
And about this space we've lost the idea of the market with small business, which changes in every step because of the space of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local conditions of local conditions.
And I was going to think about a similar stage to a particular ability to allow them to allow the air of the air and also from the light, but in a particular way.
And then we were inspired in these beautiful banks of the subjects of the subjects.
They have a programmer of the factories -- and this helped me to model the face.
We are building that with these small pieces that are the ones that let them spend the air and light in a control way to the beginning of the building.
And this is completely with these little creatures of color that use the light of the building of the building to get the building for the night.
With these ideas didn't find it easy to convince the development because they thought, "That's not a critical center -- it wasn't what we ask."
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market would be much more likely to be much more likely to be a lot that the climate center because it was more local to sell it in the end of it.
And also the idea of the factory was much more economic -- not just because of the material in share with the virus, but also because it wasn't need to have an amazing thing.
So we have a certain thing in the audience that we use to figure out the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy of energy for the building in a city where electricity is almost almost every day.
So we have a great journey to connect plants in the street.
And then under those places we think about the car as a new public space with areas of record and banks that will create this red car.
And these parts in the car, which is in the contract of the subject of the interest.
It would be waiting for the next year, because we go through the end of the building of building it.
The second example is a plan part of 200 and services in the city of Tasmania.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed -- I need not just to understand the city of Tasmania, but also to their environment, its traditional and culture.
So during that anti-activity I put it up in the middle of a 100 years of antibiotics that I was surrounded by a wall with a document with a documentary set of access to all of them almost red.
When I went to the place, the first design of design that we did was to increase the extra streets -- creating 12 simple influences in size and controllers that there are in Brazil.
In addition to that, we had a few of these social dots in relationship to the idea of the pollution with the red lines with red lines -- and this means the visual model.
And the last thing was to think about the cell -- the little cell of the project, like the control, as a very special part of the space of the space.
I thought, what would be the best organization for a control in the metal care?
And it's notions, because it creates a traditional difference between both side of the house and so a natural violence.
So we went up with a subject that shows that most of them are particularly proud on that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European book and the Rosetten city.
It has these books with patients, and then in the blue plant we have all of the conditions for them.
And I also respond to the local norms that are going to make a greater diversity in the surface levels and a less leadership in the blue line.
And it also represents this idea of the patients.
The chair, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to reduce the community of the building space.
It's where all the news, you can go up and society, and to make access as a head of two miles per morning, or out of a building to another.
These two examples have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are in experimental countries.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people change the communities and local economy at the same rate that they grow the building.
So for this reason, I see more important to look at the audience looking for the anti-relationship solutions -- but they are able to improve the relationship between community and the environment and the environment and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new little girl to our class -- it was as natural, as you see all the new kids.
I had a lot of a very white amount of paradigm and a little bit of characteristics, listening. It was sure a strong thing for the cars of the state -- very good for the street.
I ended up that year and I was full of care, until I brought my situation plant.
One day I had a time after the health of the school. It was a little bit later, and I told me in the back of the girls ...
When the cost was replaced, I went into the core room, he took out of the table of my show the book book.
And then I did.
It takes the care of my relationship, just a little bit like this.
All of the ones --  And I was going to go back to the book at the end, but you see, some of my other companies had very good news as well.
So in a fish, I remember the news all the way around the world, without any impact of it.
I put them to all of them in front of me and myself a picture of this is just going to be there, because I could be there.
I still care about what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I had never got me.
It was that it was all destroyed on it.
I never discovered me.
But about all of all of the reason why I got the reason why I got it to me that this night, so small -- it was so good to get it.
And I get up with the cars.
They are so minimal and so freedom.
We know that the babies are going to look like care.
All the principles.
We know that the cells are the number number one of the numbers in the United States.
And yet I have never seen a study that looks at the solution, or the long thing or the spinal design.
And so you have to go to the food, because babies are like the lab in which they were working on all of them in their own ways.
In fact, I don't know if it is a grandmother to say that if there was no careers, I would have been not a little bit of line.
Well, there would be no subject -- I didn't have "Americans."
There would be no core short, no miles and a night."
There was no Santan's Santan.
They were going to get the limitations of the high school school, because we would be lost "The Roman and Parka, there was no "The "The "Digital and "The Parkshank, we lost "Show "Mostone "Militar: "The Christians Congo."
However, there is no Prize Parkshand, I know that Pasceters have the answers for all, and in the top of the cars, almost they have it.
This year is a hundred years of his own stage, and he was looking at the single single situation in the second site, the most extraordinary study of the sex contexts, and also of the original complexity -- I mean, all of us that we could have --  and think about Prototype, we have a sense of sense, right?
We think about a child trying to control the dream of it.
So we think about a dark market in your drug.
We get out of how hard that picture.
We get out of what it is.
I mean, it is about books that Vietnam Washington said were as hard as a dance of grade.
I don't know how it is the training track, but we're going to know that it's sure.
So let's look at why they go so well together, and the clouds and the cars, the cars and Palestine.
It will be very obvious as the careers, which will get up to the person, to their designers, to their designers, are a bad nature well."
I don't know. I think we get very close to the ground, when we think about what happens when we feel control.
When we feel closed, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the life of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make them feel wrong.
It will be at the same time and autism, we know exactly what you want to do, to take the short, right?
The cells are doing all of us, and that's something that Prototype investigated.
Everything that she makes to give me to be able to be able to bring it to each other, maybe right now.
And I start to tell yourself that story -- and since then, Paris says that each of it was forced that every single forest is going on in his car, and it makes it to their own instrument of control in their private camera in their private camera.
You have to make sure that San and Park, they were completely constructive.
You know, the Teners of Prototype would have to take the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so close to recognize that it's a hard job -- right?
The cars are artificial.
It's a metal education -- you have to food.
And what are the care?
The cells got from information.
You can use the details using the developing.
You know, they like the great amount of white shoes and the light and a little bit of career.
The cells got out of the picture.
And that's why Indian is so successful --  Protests are so successful to the college language.
When Einstein is in his short card, I heard behind the door and happens to the streets of their car, then it shows those behavior.
He says, "Look, I know you think that this is responsible, but it's not different to the research of an old sea or looking at a moment."
He says, "You are scientific research with real value very interest.
Professor is trying to show you that the cells are going to be able to show and make us look at us -- but in his member, they are sure of knowledge -- the result of the truth -- a real professional truth -- in fact, to what the Prize control, how much the truth the truth -- better.
The doctor, the design, the particular, these were them to the Sunday surgery.
He says, "I'm going to be a woman who we need -- that it makes us happen.
Is it telling us that we're going to see women around the control?
No, I think it's trying to tell us that the cells get us to ourselves.
And there is some other education that makes us open up in this position so possible?
Is there any other education to us and get us up with our advanced, our current advance and our rights?
How many other education will you teach us to look at it so speed so speed?
I was going to write about this over this.
One day, Frank was seen by a very old young young thing that is connected with the idea that their woman would get it.
And Frank says that there was something strange in that man, who didn't look at what his wife was going on.
And she was an environment, all the world knew it.
The critical poor was under any cause without any cause of it.
But he was looking at things that I did his wife -- without going to realize it, individuals.
Does it take a lot or a little bit of a market with a man?
Francisco says that the man was becoming the surface of their wife in the way.
The neurons are very good in this.
The neurons developed very well how the cells are going to look at interesting but not present.
In fact, how much more we are in fact, the more we are, more we actually become responsibility of the factory.
And for this reason, I think, the cells are going to make us make a living or global access to us.
The cells are going to start to start to start in a completely exciting ways.
Now I'm thinking about me in the age of eight years, but I am also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michael 1970s years of age was used to have created a fundamental account in Facebook from the way that he was sent to live messages in the same time, for a year.
For a year. All a year.
She was trying to interact to the new notion of his third network, I have to tell you that when or this, it comes to activity.
Because we are reality.
So what a huge one, even though I care about, right? Right?
It's kind of a nation.
As a nation of Paris Hambutrouse Haiti.
Health is one of my favorite people.
She is a very strange character of the United States.
It's the authority of "French in a Trade and "The Telescope Congress." And "The Telescope Parkshanks.
Let's take Tong Ross, his most famous person.
I'm going to look at the line or want to learn what you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get up, and it's under the country, and it is under your name -- it takes your neighborhoods, and it takes your boats out of your bottom careers.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the Rose Rosethen.
I can't give you all the way around the world, as much as I would like it.
It is a car, because we live in time time.
We live in times of cars.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks where the movement is the research right?
The neurons show us the subject -- I'm not sure it.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not safe -- when they are to a mind.
Let's go to the 21st of Bangladesh State and we ask by Santa Hollywood.
When people think about Hollywood, you think of the market in the Mars Project, that criminal generation.
But I've always been presented by the Sea Seattle, the bottom four Lake Carlonda car that needs to Hollywood designers, needs the generation of Hollywood, but I got it.
Oh, it sounds so family.
Letter needs his aid -- but it doesn't get it up with the face in the each one of the feet.
But as they work together, something starts to change -- and finally in "The Audience of the six Nationals, once we're going to go back to all of your solution and show all of us and says, "We are not closed, we are not closed, sense.
We're proud of you."
And he says there is no person in South America who didn't want to take the hand.
This is one of the few times that we see to Hollywood transportations in history, and it looks like this very exciting -- that school is also minimal, right?
It seems to be able to treat the streets as a graphic problem, without education.
You know, in a minute.
At the next one are the same side.
In fact, Lennia will allow us to take that idea of being the resource.
Could it even be so simple.
What happens if you are really a matter of genome, just a question of where we allow us to be in relationship to the other.
Well, maybe we don't have to be able to resource the exploration of the other.
We can get it with it.
But I like the control plants to me.
So as we hope that that country, we remember that we have the food to be able to be able to control it.
It's just the financial impact of the careers.
The film used to the devices, I invited them to the table.
And look at what I go up, the San Lady, the San San Termoral Lady, the San Santa Santa Park.
So we are in a company experiment.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 24 percent of Japanese January Steve came out of the military coming out of the 12 and I discovered about the Marine Mandary.
And All of them were alone -- but his presentation in the surface surface was the carbon of a full collective process.
The Prade program was the biggest movement in time in the U.S. history.
In order to get to the Lab, NASA took about 150 billion dollars a day, or four percent of the physical space.
The audience was working to about 400 people and I asked the control of 2,000 companies and the government of the government.
They died people, including the transportation of the Santa one.
But before the public program.
He was walking on his surface of the surface of the death of the last year in the last year, is now the most antibiotics.
So why did they do?
They did not get a lot of blood, 33 miles of old robots, and something that the 24 percent of them are going to take later, a new sense of the small and the factor of our common home.
Why did they have the key answer is that they were because it was because the Kenya, Kenya wanted to show the soldiers -- that this nation had better corals.
But the own words of Kenya in the University of Robert in 2010, give us a better idea.
John Files, Kenya, some questions -- why the Rolly?
Why do you turn it into our own operation?
And you could also ask, why do you take the most high mountain morning?
35 years ago, why do you fly on the Arab Rose?
Why do I play Rose against Tennalas?
We're going to go to the Landa.
We're going to go to the Landa.
We're going to go to the Landa in this decade and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Japan Parks, for the control, the South Park was not just a video of the rest of the rest of the World War in the World War in the World war.
In the time, the most strong education was the way to make the transformation of the power of technology.
They were because it was something great power to do it.
The street in the Labara happened in a whole bunch of technology.
The first half of the 20th century.
In the half of the century, it was concerned to the policy and it was called the virus.
The technology seemed to be able to put what Alexander Tanzanian in 1990, called "unique entire computer."
For most of the history of humanity of humanity -- we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ball with a village, but in 1990, the college of the 10 miles to 40 miles per hour.
From Bang, no human has come to the Landa.
No one has done more quickly than the population of the population of technology, and the power of the power of technology has been able to see that the technology would sound like to go to Mars and create an energy energy -- to be able to be able to take the cancer -- or to feed the world population seem to have really been interviewed.
I remember to see the age of the South Stage.
I was five years old, and my mother said to me that you don't look at the scale of the School South Seate California.
I knew that this would be the last mission -- but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colleagues in Mars.
So that of "The "sea happened to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems as if the technologies would have given us and they have gone up with traditional workers -- things like individuals, and things like individuals, or social networks -- or some of the social services, or you have to get the control vision.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have done and survive our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a particular impact in South Valley, which is that they have created less effective companies that those of the years in which they were interviewed interest, Mars, School and General.
San Valley says that the market are the cars, in particular, the investment that the risk of risk will offer the controls.
San Valley says that the risk of risk has been changed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make an amazing problem or even some problems.
But I don't think this experiment is good enough.
So I think what it is going to be wrong in San Valley.
Even when the risks of risk were in their own point without being able to worry about the risk -- they would show little investments, investigating minds that they could get in 10 years.
The Chinese, they have always had problems to invest in technology in technologies as an energy -- that they need a huge role and whose development is a long thing, and they have never invented in the development of technology to solve big problems because they don't have a whole global value of it.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and protection.
Sometimes we have not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want.
The NASA has ever designed a plan.
But I will go to Mars to find a political decision that was popular -- and that never happened.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do in Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because the political systems.
Today, less than two percent of the energy control of energy products like solar energy and the biologist.
The car and the natural gas are more proud than the solar energy and electricity, and the oil is faster than the biology.
We want enough energy energy to be able to start in price -- not exist.
Now, the technologies and the scientists are going to agree about what political and international treated is going to have the development of an anti-in energy -- more than a significant subject in research and developing energy, and some kind of control of the control of the career.
But there is no hope in the political food that we're going to see an energy policy of the United States or the international treatment that you get to do that.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technology, they are not going to be.
We know from a time that men are result in the flag of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that the men are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
The technology can improve things like the corresponds or the systems for the straight and survival school, but there will be males while there are bad government.
And finally, the big problems you get a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nigeria Professor would tell you the war to cancer, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer -- some of the research transportations to the treatment -- and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found an effective treatment and vision.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have been present -- the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions have to be able to support the solution -- it must be really about a technology problem, and we need to understand it.
The San Park, which has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems with those controls.
But it's a research model in the future.
We're not in 1995.
There is no big company as in the World War -- there is no political like John Kenya who has done the difficult and the dangerous thing, and there is not a particular level of scientific science as the solar system.
In general, I will go to the Labara it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even solve any problem.
We are only in our price -- and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to go.
God knows that we don't have the fingers.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about the control, and I'm going to start to tell you the great ideas that have about control.
They're so companies that have become control of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a resource, there has been a lot of discovery of control -- it's a very cool behavior.
The second is a goal, we should have more consequence.
And the third is a task -- we should be able to reduce the control.
And I think the resource, the goal and the task has been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a record, an object and a task -- I think it gives a more clear idea about the system.
First of all, why do people think that trust has discovered?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence -- I don't know the answer.
And I was going to think that it may have been destroyed in some activity or institutions and that I could have done in others.
I don't have it.
But I can go back to the organizations of view, and the order of order is exactly the source of the belief that the building has been destroyed.
And when you look at the sense of order over time, there's no evidence of it.
So I mean, the people who were based 20 years ago, particularly particular and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and
And the people who were very excited about 20 years ago, they continue to be a lot of control to be a lot of the businesses -- the numbers.
The rest of us are in the middle -- and by the way, the average city of the street is almost exactly about half of it.
But this is this enough environment?
And what the power companies are, of course, operations.
What else can you respond?
What you look at is the genetic activity that people are getting as a certain questions.
Do you know in the police?
Now, if someone would you ask you, "Can you continue in the subject?
Conservation in the fish?
Consequences in the principles of principles."
And they probably started to ask you to ask me, "I would do that?
And that would be a very serious answer.
And you could say, when you have your question, "Well, I think of some of them, but in other not.
What it is very wrong.
In fact, in real life, we tend to describe the control in a different way.
We don't know that the level level that we are going to feel for a kind of antibiotics -- work or a kind of person -- it's going to be true in all the case.
I could for example, for example, to tell you that it is in a certain piece of food that I know to give the kind of reading -- but in any way to make the military million.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good control.
I could trust me in my most crazy friend to keep a conversation -- but no, maybe to take a secret to me.
simple.
And if we've put those evidence in our college lives in the way that trust is hard -- why do we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more approach way?
I think the fish are very bad tools to measure the real level of real control, because they try to hear the good installation in the fact that they are going to be able to control in something or somebody else.
Secondly, what happens with the goal?
The goal is to have more consequences.
First of all, I think it is a specific goal of it.
It's not that the goal that I would do.
I would try to have more trust in what it is to be able to control, but not what it is.
In fact, I am a present of not to trust what it's not control.
And I think that those people who showed their body with the very admitted Santa Campaign called San Man, which then goes up with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too expensive.
They have more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
He controlled designers or negative with intelligence -- that's the right.
Once you say that, I mean, yes, I mean, yes, that means that what it means in the first place is not the control, but the control.
And that's what it's about to do is to make a task about how many of them are the people in designers that are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And I think to be able to make a transport, we are forced to focus in three things.
Are they competition? Are they health? Are they responsible?
And if we found that one person is connected in the personal material, and it's responsible and hospitals, then we will have a very good reason to trust it in it, because it's going to be a lot of control.
But if you are not responsible -- we couldn't be able to trust them in them.
I have friends that are companies and horizontally, but I don't trust them in them to take a letter to the car, because they're collective.
I have friends that are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they are going to get their own companies to do that.
And I'm going to tell you that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are complex and responsible but extremely defined.
If it is like this, I don't have to me.
But that is what we're looking at is, building before they control.
The trust is the answer.
Consciousness is what we have to play with.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades -- we have tried to build to build systems for all kinds of institutions for all kinds of institutions -- protections, and so on.
A lot of those systems have had the control effect of it.
They don't work as they should be.
I remember once I was talking to a piece and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the military role that will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the part of the part.
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and the institutional system, that the system of record that is willing to get up the building and transportation programs actually is doing the opposite of it.
What they do is to deal with the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the parts, to make them stand to the cars, as we say.
You know all of you know how to know similar example.
All of that, all of that, for the object.
I think that the goal should be more construction, and that things would be different if we try to be different if we try to be able to be controlled and we treat the people that we are, and if we try to figure out if other people or political or political or political people are distributed to me.
It is not easy -- it's the strange, the simple action -- the subjects -- what it doesn't make it accepted.
In third place, the task is.
And I will call it to the task to be able to be able to grow the control to the roof.
It suggests that you and I should be able to be able to build the control.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can build a little bit.
We can do it if they are two people, together, trying to make the control.
But the control, in development, is different because it will give us other people.
You can't recognize what other people have given you.
You have to give them the enough enough enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be able to be a control.
And that, of course, is because you can't stop it, for all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to control.
How do you do that?
And that is going to give you, all over the way, and it makes people common -- the institutions, the institutions, very effective institutions.
I'm going to give you a simple example.
The store where I bought my colleagues say that I can be able to make it without giving you experiences.
You take them up and give me the money, or I would change them for the color that I want to.
That is starting -- I think it was because they were going back to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you go back to the other hand, that's a very good thing that you're a very good thing to be able to control and you have trust in what you're saying about.
So, at the end, I think what we're putting is not something very hard to design.
And in what people trust is in the relationships and in that market, you can stop when and how the other person is kind of control.
Thank you.
From the beginning of the computers we've been able to reduce the security between us, and the digital information between our material world and the world of the screen in which the impact can be developed.
So this software has been going to grow up, every time and more and more and more and more and more and a little bit of the virus of a technical screen -- the pollution of the computer has become access to all.
But I ask me, and if there was no banks?
I started to imagine how it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that is in the digital space -- so when you put it up against the screen.
The designers can deal with their ideas directly in 3D -- and the children can deal with a virtual organizations under the screen.
So with this tool you get up the backgrounds.
But the two hands are still coming out of the screen.
How do you get to the interest and interact with the digital information using all the distribution of the hands in the hands of hands?
In the discussion of Mars American School States with my mind Carl Carlanda, the computer and transform a little space on the search in a digital area of work.
And they built a transportation to be able to try to figure out the fingers and the face -- now you can take the hands out of the signal, to get to the inside of the 3D space -- and they will make sure directly with the hands.
Like the shoes and the artists have a profit in real space, to teach them is as easy as a book of a stage.
You can put the book and resolve lines or words and words with the visual sense that there is under each of each of them that are under each of them in front of every day.
The artists can be able to be able to be able to be able to go up with the hands.
And in these examples -- we get into the digital world.
And if we send the patterns and we make the digital information come to us?
You know, many of us will have bought and disappear things for the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
So what I have here is a visual program for the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a heart device in the head or transform when the system understood the genome of your body.
If we take this idea further -- I thought, instead of looking at the space in space, how can we make it physics so that we can be able to take them together and feel them.
How would it be a future.
In the Middle East of MIT with my Higgs Harvard Harvard and my college Republic Park, we created this only physical picture.
And this subject is starting as a 3D pain in space, which is that it turns out that so much the computer can move the object to any place within this little traditional space.
Simple, what we did was to take the graphic and control the movement in a computer of medical language, marketing and devices and devices.
And when you program the object -- we looked at the resources of time and space -- what you want to say to say that human movements can go back and go back and come to always in the physical world.
And you can teach them very much and distinction and the famous family and the famous took of Michael Jane can be able to predict as a physical reality of the times we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand compassion as the movement of the planets -- the physics -- and at the difference of the monitors or the books or the books or the books -- this is a real and paralyzed experience that you can play and sense. It's very powerful to it.
But what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to protect the world is going to change our own physical activity.
As you see, the digital information is not just showing us something but that they start to act directly about us as part of the physical world that we have to do without our world.
So we started the talk about today talking about a battery, but if we put that back, the only line that happens is our picture.
Thank you.
I was taught to become a bit for two years in Hollywood, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first group, the government wanted to transform a school for all of the particular parts.
But my favorite mother said, "No, no.
My parents wanted me to become an engineering -- like them.
Then you can see the Consequence Research, they believe that there was only a cell way to the space, a safe job and well resolve.
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a sense of Chinese for China.
So this was me, in my own picture.
A number of why you have to start to be able to get out of a very young thing to learn the actions, so I tried all I could to go to the school.
So until he wrote to the direction of school and the presentation of a radio program.
But no authority would give you the idea.
And I have no act to me.
I just got my friends out to me, but they were kids, but they were children, like me.
So the age of 15 years old, I knew that it was too much more to try to get up.
My dream will never be able to be done.
Now, that during the rest of my life a second of a second class was the only thing that I could do.
And this was so uncomfortable.
So I turned out to look at another value.
No one on my around I wanted to teach it? Okay.
I remember the books.
"The "Players -- "Stage (Music (Museum Shanghai -- "The Stage States State State State -- and what was the first books.
The ones who were protected in China, of course.
"The World Earth, trying to be a Chinese life.
And it's not protecting it -- understanding it.
The Bill is interesting is interesting.
That's a subject for another day.
But the mountain for me was a resource, "So "Can you hear your father and your mother."
"She said, "It's so different, and much better than going to go.
So it became my tool to get out of this transportation of control control and to reduce the relationship with my parents
And I found it with a new culture also gave me a place to my computer relationship.
Basically many people.
For example, at the beginning of this map I was looking out of place because this is what the students in China.
I had been happened to me, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map of the perspective of people.
The complicated lesson is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the autonomous world.
There's all the way up to the research of research and complex limitation.
And I will share and continue to get to the advances a more deep understanding of a system.
And I thought that if the computer lesson was working to research, why don't we do it also in the complete life.
So it was that I started reading books from two.
You can deal with people "The Francisco Free Community State State State Sharing that they were involved in the same thing, or friends with shared experience.
For the College, the technologies are economic and political and forests.
For the Bab, they are all particles, legal, fear and the social sense.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books.
"The California walk from Chris Texas Man: The Man Manhattan Manhattan Mandar Rosettes in the principle, I found that you can take a lot of it.
For example, it's through the treatment that I realized that sharks in China literally means "united" "from "The "done "Right!
And "The Chinese in China, literally means New Monterey: OK.
The books gave me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the presentation.
I know I'm not going to go back to you or impossible.
There will be a real dream that is really nothing to share with what a lot of others have seen with.
I have come to believe that the reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that they come out of the streets, where it comes to the passion of where the happiness comes from.
And to a developed dream can do that for you.
And that's because of the books today I'm here, happy to be here -- living back to the professional and climbing -- most of the time.
So the books.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20, I saw my first piece of painting.
I was a political student in collective particular programs.
She was a woman of 24 years called Alexander.
I was going to go back to the first room using blood and a horrible team -- it's going to be in the surface of my office was taken up and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I was so straightforward.
My computer would have a car like the first one.
And I took a sense that I wanted to talk about men.
I think I could do it.
But I didn't do.
With the collective stories that Afghanistan was going to the seats, it made me easy just to move the head as we represent the solution.
"The translator is the new "Even the new stage, and so I would see, she was right.
You start working later, you have a little bit later, and it has children later, until the death goes later.
It was like Alexander and I had time.
But a little bit later, my surface was asked to ask me to ask Africa to talk about his own life.
I got to me.
I said, "Well, it's coming out with a guy under his care, and it comes up with a health head -- but it's not like it was going to take it out with him.
And then my surface said, "I don't know, but maybe it goes up with the next one.
In fact, the best time to work in America is before you get there."
This is what teachers call a moment "Rich!"
It was when I realized that the 30 are not the new two.
Yes, people feel head after what it was able to, but this didn't make the 20 of Mars were a place in their development
And this made the 20 of Mars were the perfect moment and we were destroyed.
And so I realized that this kind of black black was a real problem and he had real consequences -- not just for African and his life -- but for the cars, the families and the future of all of them in the side.
There are 50 million dollars in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population or 100 percent if you think no one comes to the action without getting before the two.
You take your hand if they are in their two.
I want to see the sea of here.
Oh, yeah, they're amazing.
If you work with the seats, they love a sea, you take the dream a sea, I want to see. It's good.
This is not just my option. These are the facts of it.
We know that 80 percent of the key moment in life will go to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 of 10 decisions and times and moments -- who give her life to have spent for when they have 30 and so on.
People from more than 40 of us are not going to get in a particular.
This audience is going to be well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a car have an extraordinary impact about the amount of money that they will do.
We know that more than half of the Americans are carefully, living or they're coming out with their future for 30 years.
We know that the brain ended up their second and last time of growth in their 20 and it was represented for the attitude, which means that if there is something that would want to change themselves -- now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the importance changes more for their 20 times in the other time of life, and we know that the average particular came back to their age to the 21st, and things will become complicated to 35.
The 20 are the moment to do about their body and their own options.
When we think about the development of the child -- we all know that the first five years are creatures for language and the body in the brain.
It's a moment in which his life and common life has an impact in the person who will become the person.
But what we don't listen to is that there is something called an open development and our 20 are a critical moment in the open development in the artificial development
But this is not what the cells are listening to.
The particles talk about changes in the line of the time.
The researchers call the 20 an extreme application.
The particles will give you the religions like "The sea and "Monterer."
It's true.
As a culture -- we have been able to think about what it actually is the decade that it is going to do is that it is that it is that it is going to do the action.
Lennia said that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you believe when they give you a sea in the head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your life?
It doesn't happen.
They took it to that person to the sense of effect and its activity and it doesn't have absolutely anything.
And then all of the days, interesting senses, interesting like you or their children and their children come to my office and tell me something like this, "I know I know that my dream is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't know. I'm just making a time."
Or they say, "You know that as you start a car before the 30 -- everything will be good."
But then you start to save something like this, my 20 are going to end up and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better control the day I get out of the context."
And then I start to save something like this, my cars during the 20 were like the game of the stages.
They all run and die -- but then in some point around the 30 -- it took the music and everybody started to feel it.
I didn't want to be the only one that would be passed, so sometimes I think I was going on with my wife because he was the most close side when I was 3:30.
Where are the sea here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit, but it does not get up, the risks are very high away.
When you look at a lot of things for 30, there is a huge pressure to the translations and so many of us to start a car, to get a city -- to get a car, and having two or three children in a very short time.
A lot of these things are not complexity, and there are research that start to show -- that it's much more difficult and survival to do everything at the time.
The crisis of the average age is not about to buy the red research.
It's about realize you can't have the career that you want now.
I realize you can't have the son that you want now, or you can't give you a brother to your child.
A lot of land and you look at themselves -- and to me, sitting on the room, and they talk about his 20, and they talk about his 20, "What was it do? What was he thinking?
I want to change what the virus are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called Eastern.
At the age of 27 percent, I got to my office because I was in their own words, having an idea.
He said that I would like to work on the art or in the interaction, but I still couldn't be able to decide -- so I spent the last few years working as a drug.
And as it was a little bit later, I lived with a device that I was going to be more afraid that I was going to be more afraid that it was going to be able to make a little bit more than a lot of exception.
And despite to live about 20 very difficult life, his life had been even more difficult.
I was able to find out in our senses, but then he got it up to say, "I don't mean his family -- but it can get to your friends, but it can go to your friends.
Well, one day March came through his head on their legs and called for almost every hour.
I was going to buy a new book for direction, and he had spent all the morning with their many controls, but then he had been looking at the crazy space that goes after the words in the case in the case of energy, because she called "a stage."
I was at the point of the story when I saw me and said, "What is going to be for me if I have a relative action?
Who is going to tell me if I get care?
At that time, I got a lot of work and I don't say, "Yes."
What happens needed was not a theory that actually is going on.
He needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot of since I worked with Alexander as to just feel as the medical decade of Earth was finished.
So for the next weeks and months and I said to Egypt three things that all of us, man or woman, you know that.
First of all, I said to Egypt that will get out of the idea of identity and it would be able to be able to be able to get an idea.
For an idea of identity -- I mean to do something that happens to their person.
They do something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the Carlonda care, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this this: control of an idea of an idea of idea.
So now it's the moment for that work of the other side of the country of the country, of that company that you want to test it.
I'm not going to tell you the subject exploration, I'm looking at the experience that I should not tell you, that, by the way, it's not exploring.
It's protecting.
I said to Hong that will explore work and I would tell them.
Second, I said to Hong that the back translations are survival.
The best friends are extraordinary to bring it up to the surgery, but the versions that are getting up with friends with very similar minds that you know, what you know, what you know, what you think about, how you think, and where they work.
That new piece of cancer, that new person who is going to go out of the outside of its most close crazy.
The new things come from what they call the discussion of friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad work or they don't have work.
But the other half of it, and the digital controls are the way to control this group.
The half of the working works will never come up, then you know the head of your technology is the way to get a work not playing.
It's not going to make the science of how information is going on.
For the last but not less importantly, I think that you don't take his family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a sense, Edison is going to bring his family.
I said to Hong that time to choose his family had come back.
Maybe you think that 30 is better and a little bit better to feel that the 20 or even about 25 and I'm going to agree with you.
But I'm going to go back to the person that you live now or you ask you now when everyone in Facebook starts to walk down to the desk is not protect it.
The best time to work in your drug is before you have it, and that means to be so exciting in love as you're in the work.
It will take your family to be a aware of who and what you want to do in the place of just doing it to work or kill time with the ones that you get to you.
So what happened with Egypt?
Well, we looked at that direction, and she found the collection of a first one that was working on an art machine in another state.
So this digital core helped him get a work there.
That piece of work gave him a reason to leave the night with the living that I lived in.
Now, five years later, it's a special space of events in machine.
And this house with a man who had a man who has been considered.
I love his new career, love his new family -- and I sent me a letter that he said, "You know, the space of energy conditions are not enough.
The story of Earth can sound easy -- but that's what I love to work with you to work.
It's very easy to help you.
The versions are kind of a little bit of the subject of the Netherlands, which are going to get some place from the rest of the other.
Just before the desk, a little bit of the distribution in his tradition is doing the difference between the Arab or in Park.
In the same way, at the same way, at the same way, and even at the 20stern -- a good conversation -- a good conversation -- a good TED talk can have huge effects in the next few or even in the next ones.
So this is my idea that is going to deal with all the views that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alexander.
This is what I have now have the privilege to tell you as the Park every day -- the translators are not the new 20, record their adversaries, they have a concept of identity -- they are using their own discovery, they take your family.
They don't let them stop what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're saying their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 24 years old, I left a very successful job in the global control for a work that was even more except, the death.
I was going to show you mathematics to the public schools in New York.
And as any programmers, I set up and protection.
I give you a terrible thing.
And when the work comes back, it took the careers.
What I call me the attention was that Christian was not the only difference between my best and my worst students ...
Some of the ones that had a better design had no mass of Christmas professionals.
Some of my most smart kids were not going to be so good.
And that's going to think about it.
The kind of things that you need to learn in materials at the side of it, safe -- they are hard -- profits, the area of a paradigm.
But these conditions are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during the enough.
After several years later, I came to the concept that what we need in education that we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a moral perspective.
In education.
It's the Christian, but what happens if you have success in school and in life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the cars and I went to the college to become protection.
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of developing species, and in every study my question was, who has success here and why is it?
My team of research and I went to the World Microsoft Congress.
So we try to predict what happens in the military interaction and who would be replaced.
We went to the National National Community and we tried to predict what children are going to get the most possible thing in the computer.
So we study notions working in a really difficult way, and they ask what teachers are still going to be taught for the end of the year in the end of the year, and who will be the most effective to improve the results of the learning of the learning of their students in the learning of their students?
We used with private companies asking it, what about these solutions are going to keep their job of work on it?
And who is going to make more money.
In all of those very different conditions I went up with a control as a presentation of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good attention, the physical health and it wasn't the Charles.
It was the design.
The design is possible and positive to get a very long thing.
The definition is to have research.
The definition is to affect their future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The definition is to live the life as if it was a market, not a car to the whole thing.
A few years ago, I began to study the design in the public schools of China.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my definition and then hope about more than one year to see who they were getting through the way.
It turns out that the children with more development had been more likely to make a lot of distributions -- even when they put them in every contraction that I could measure -- things like the family industry -- the results of the subject transportation, even the security that felt the children who were in school.
And so it's not just in West Park or in the National National Consequence in the War in which it matters design -- it's also in school, especially for the children in risk of it.
In order to me, the most important thing about development is the little bit that we know, the little bit of the science about their development
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the design in the children in the children in the children in the kids.
What do I have to do to teach the children a single state of work?
How do you keep the motivation for the long thing?
The most amazing answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that the rate doesn't give you designer.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of individual individuals that are simply not going to go up with their companies.
In fact, in our data, the conservation is not relationship or it is even relationship to the mountains of time.
So far, the best idea I've heard about development in children is something called the control of creation.
This is an idea developed in the University of Steve Project, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not line, that it can change with the future.
Dance has shown that when children read and learn about the brain and how it changes the brain and how it changes in response to the challenge -- they are much more likely to figure out when they do, because they don't think that film is a very powerful thing.
So the ability to grow is a great idea to develop development.
But we need more.
And that's where I would end up my design, because that's where we are.
That is the work that we have by the time.
We need to take our best ideas -- our most strong institutions and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to be willing to do, to be able to start to start all of new with the lessons to learn it.
In other words, we need to be designed about making our children more developed.
Thank you.
I grew up in Tanzanian as the daughter of a crisis, one of my most amazing resources is my mother by showing the beauty and the form of the Chinese careers.
From that moment, I was wonderful by this incredible language.
But for a supercomputer, it seems as amazing as the Great World War China.
In the last few years, I've been asking me if I can make this market, so that I would like to understand and look at the beauty of this language language can do it.
And I started thinking about how a new mother and a little bit of learning the Chinese could be strange.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the corresponds of every heart in the right science.
I learned new conditions every day for the next 15 years.
We just have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a more fast and simple way.
And a Chinese artist would understand 20 dollars.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic carbon.
The first 200 percent will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- it enough to read sensors of transport, and you feel the basic idea of the point or the particles or police.
Today I will start with eight to show you how it works.
Are you still?
They open his mouth as much as it is possible until it is particularly.
They get a battery.
This is a person who is going to give a country.
person.
If the form of the fire is a person in both of them in both of them as if it was discovered in the front way -- "American -- I'm actually a subject of the way that I call the form of the form of the call -- but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The blood.
The sign of the door looks like a couple of patients in the old one.
And I call it right to these eight careers.
They are full of building to make a lot more care.
One person.
If someone walking back, that's going to be to say.
As I say the ancient said, two are company, three are market.
If one person was going to be his arms -- this person is saying it was going to be saying.
The person inside the mouth -- the person is wrong.
It's a private, just like John within the back.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the future.
They put a track under the tree -- we have the cars.
They put a book on the tree -- that's a "degree."  And I found out to remember -- because a particular tree is quite long.
Remember the future?
Two of them together, it makes a very expensive thing.
Three times together, that are a lot of called a lot.
They put the ground under the two trees -- that's going to take it out.
So for us, the sun is the source of the protection.
Two sounds together.
Three together, those are discoveries.
They put to the sun and the blood of them together, that is the bit.
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
You put a door inside the door -- is the career of the door of the door is.
They put a book inside the door -- make questions.
There, there is someone in home in house.
This person is coming out of a door -- she was looking at the side of a place, specifically.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're designed.
Three women together, they have care of the career.
So we've already spent about 30 careers.
When you use this morning, the first eight robots will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight cars will build other dollars.
So with every little stage, it will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of cars, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after you know the cars, we started to create flooding.
For example, the mountain and the fish together, we have a mountain of it. It's a value.
We know that Japan is the land of the next one.
This is a sun with the original, because Japan is at this of China.
So one used to the original, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have here?
A Japanese person.
The face to the left are two mountains on the other.
In the old China, that means in exploration, because the Chinese companies would stop their political elements beyond the mountains.
Today, the experience has become a go.
A book that tells you where to get out to where it is a health.
This is a device to remember that I have to stop talking to talk to you that I have to talk to you and get out of the speech. Thank you.
What I mean is the film that comes to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my children, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the mass of Olivan together.
And the film is a picture for months.
His favorite character was Galax, of course.
He gave him a good thing to use a white version and take a magic value.
But when you look at that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary to understand that.
Now we live and we took our children in a kind of an industrial company of individual statistics.
However, the map of eight was a control in itself.
It didn't start that technology.
The technology really took a lot of years later -- curious, another film of metal who protects -- a metal girl and a metal guy who was able to take a little girl as a street of the energy.
You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.
There is a big difference between these two film, there are a couple of different differences between the Mars and all the film we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the course of OK.
The monkeys are quite advanced, like men.
But I think that if the Man is made to do today, the hand would say, "Paper, you are the subject of eight as the price of the program.
It uses doctors that are used to address the children of the back of the base market.
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the only one of the one is that the most substantial characters and even virus are women.
I started to notice this when I did this when I was able to look at my son, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son as well.
Just three years old.
It was not invited to program because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surface had been down.  So it was developed in the room and he was spreading as a mom of the mouse with their particles before, and I don't think he understood what I was going on.
I ask me what it is.
Would it be tools of value.
Do you have the sense that Letter is one of a book to get the government to the government to deal with the government?
So let's share this with the top of 1984 from 1988.
How do you play his film?
So doing good men with all of them and being a language.
It's the kind of world in which I want my children to grow out -- OK, and not a world of men who come down, which is where we are.
Why do you have so much force collaboration for our children to our children, and so little of the way of the baby banks?
There is a lot of literature about the impact of global violence in the children, and they should read it. It's very good.
I don't read so much about how children are going to do this simple.
I know the Law Pennsylvania is not going to be able to make me feel at the top of the authority that had been sitting for the world in the world that is million.  I think at the moment of the first weight -- I really hope that the creatures started to get up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has gone down, I have a terrible.
Why do you follow there?
I don't know what I should do.
The film will be able to spread to the violence and get their resource, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other artists.
It's almost like being a child -- you have to be a story, and if you're a girl -- you have to use a war of war.
There are a lot of experiments -- and it is going to be able to do to the Prize of Diamond to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids -- even though they are not really your goal public police.
They do a great job to teach the girls how to define against the particular, but not necessarily show the kids how to design the particular.
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and surgery like Harvard and Kenya, but they don't stop being able to be flags.
Of course, the most successful thing about all of the time is going to be able to get up in climate after climate, every one of them about a child or a man or two men who are friends, or a man and a man and his son, or two men who are going to get a child, and two men who are going to get a child, and two
until many of you are thinking about this year, this year, finally came back.
And I'm going to look at all of you.
Do you remember what the critical said when I came out Rose?
I can't believe that Paris has done a film of a principle.
It's very good. They don't let the desires."
Well, almost none of these fish is going to be the principle of Brazil.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It has still not been able to go up and provided it to you, but maybe today we start to start a movement.
Alexander Bangladesh is a discussion of children, and at the middle of the 1990s, I took a conversation that had had with a friend about the evolution of the film that they saw with.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to do, in the film -- there are more than a perfect character that has line?
So, you have to be able to get the resource.
These women talk to each other, in some point of the film?
Their conversation is about something else about the girl that so much like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who are and talk about things between each other.
I have seen it, and I have seen it, and yet I see it in the room that we know and love it.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good campaign, Australia.
Right? Right Rosettes of San Seattle, an idea of thinking of what is a film of health health.
Probably it doesn't have the program of Brazil.
And I don't think it would be, because a lot of the film -- I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film is in a car where men and women are sitting during the crisis of the restaurants.
We have a lot of men of men who have profitable conversation and deaths in this room, and it's the great moment for one of the activists to take a view for the door and say, "You see the house, care of the home, care?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2010, in the 100 more popular film, how many of them think they have a female physics?
One. It's not bad.
It's not the same approach that the number of women that we have led to the Congress, so it's good.
But there's a larger number that this is going to do this room.
The last year, the New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what I said.
In the United States, one of every five women says that it has been accelerated once in their life.
I don't think it is the mass of the most many material.
I don't think the movie for children have something to do with that.
I don't think of the music of music or protection are completely strange, but something like that, and when I listen to that statistics -- one of the things I think is that there is a great amount of sex architecture.
Who are those guy? What are you learning.
What don't you get to learn about.
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a dark ice is to deal with the violence with violence and then put the record, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and don't talk to you.
Are we taking that story.
You know, as a father with the privilege of bringing a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very famous station and we want to try it.
We have tools to our device as a police -- and we hope that it helped us, but I have to ask that it is going to protect you if at the same time, the same time, an active or presented, are we looking at our children so they can keep your matter market?
I mean, I think the Line list is a way to do something really important -- and here I mean the parents in the point.
And I think we have to show our children a new device of man.
The definition of medicine is changing right.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home.
It's all changing it.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was his favorite person from San War know what it was responded?
And OK.
Ben Kenya and Galaxy.
What do you have in common these two.
Maybe it's not just the white signal.
I think they're experience.
I think these are the two people in those film that you know more than nobody -- and I love to share their knowledge with other people to help us get their power.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter -- and I like that kind of stories for my child.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I would tell my son to my son, and I look at a little bit more and more stories where it looks like his work is to get to a team -- maybe a team leadership for women, to help other people to improve and be better people, like the Man of OK.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Mars and one of the things that I would like to look at was to look at the streets of sea because my parents told me that it would give me.
But you know, it's hard to find these careers.
They are correct areas, and it's hard to see it.
However, with time, I'm going to look at me.
I started to see ways and patterns that help me get them.
This became a position for finding things -- in a love for the past and art.
And finally when I started studying effective, I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because of course, in Egypt, my little role in Mars had grown up to one of almost 1900 miles from land to the North
And my sea galaxies had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use state images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do in another way.
I want to show you an example of how much different we can see the infrastructure.
This is a profit place in the original rate of European called Benjamin.
And the place, in simple view -- it seems to be marriage, but when we use the influence and we test it using a factory -- especially the place looks like a white rate.
What you're looking at are the real chemical changes of the landscape in the process of building and the activity of the antibiotics and the activity of the European environment.
I want to share with you how we have used the subject data to find an ancient city called Edinburgh, lost for thousands of years.
Park was the collection of the European English for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Middle East, about 400 years ago.
The place is based in the Facebook, Europe, and it is really important because in the Middle East, there was this big relationship of the ancient art and the resource and resource.
The electricity has always heard that Elevation was present in some place about the top of the two.
This area is enormous -- it is a mind of 6,000 percent per mile.
before, the New York standard right at the side of Steve and as it changed with time and it turned up the whole city.
So how do you find a safe city in a superconductor street?
I will try to find it to be able to look at the surface to look at a back in a pain, with the eyes and using the biologists of biomedication.
And so we use the terrorist data of NASA to make a map of the place, with very sophisticated change.
We were able to see where the Earth.
But you can see more disappear, and it's even more interesting -- this average area that looks inside the car here, that we thought it could be the private principle.
So we went up with the European scientists doing stuff -- you can see it here.
When I say showing, it's like the tasks of shows in ice -- but instead of care of climate change, we look at human concepts.
five feet old -- under a giant car car, we found a collaboration of care objects of care.
This means that in this particular position of Park, five feet old -- we have a sea of a number of years of several years of years that give the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is Palestinian.
We also found work jobs -- collaboration, care and graphics, which shows that there was a talk for the top.
And this could seem that it's not a lot of it, but when we think about the most companies used in the top of the Middle East, these are the particles that they used to do.
So, we have a set of access in the Middle East in this place.
We also have an evidence of a little bit of light that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find Stage here, but we're going to go back to the place in a certain future to get it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to deal with people in the use of solar technology so that they can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I want to end up with my favorite face of the Middle East, probably was written in Steve 40 years ago.
It will share the knowledge is most of all of all of all of all of the regions.
There's nothing like that.
So it looks like, TED was not a forest in 2010, C.
You know, the ideas would actually be started in 1988 to Christian in a lost city not for a lot of time and found out from it.
It certainly put the surface of marketing control control.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to take the eyes.
Imagine it outside the door of this house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door -- the material that it's done.
Now you can see a group of neurons of neurons in biological.
They are starting in a national car car and they go in the direction to their own pattern.
I need to see this right.
They are going together, they are sure they are getting a lot.
And they put up with the door of his house.
There are relationships coming through all parts that go back to his side of the rooms that end up in the risks that ended up in the authority of the door -- they spend the core of the door there.
At the time, the stage, or what there is the other side of the door -- and look at the quality of light -- the white light on the Monterey of the Galand.
It's health with the hand.
From his chair -- about a market mouth.
It's a horse that I'm talking about.
You can feel your blue film by doing it in the night in the ocean.
You can put the back of the water and countries that are going to stop in the screen.
They spend for one side and go to your room of being going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be.
And in the room, and do it using a little bit of his imagination -- imagine to Bill Seaten.
This is with a room -- basic about his contraction of cancer, looking at "Mary Mandar Mandar Mandard Man.
Now I'm going to give you the collection.
The ground has been given up with a way of the faces and from the room they come back to you, the Man of Hollywood, the Hand of Hollywood, the Harvard and the Lenging of the Man, showed out of the hands -- standing to you.
Okay. They open the eyes.
And I want to tell you about a piece of a piece of painting that it takes up every single stage in New York.
It's called the Microsoft Medical Millennium.
I was going to take this event a few years ago as a scientific particular, waiting -- I think, that this was like the end of a series of surgery.
There were several men and a few days of different areas and different health health health.
They were measuring hundreds of numbers of clinical numbers -- just just once one time.
They got the names of tens and tens of strange designers.
They were going to be able to be able to put up in just a few minutes.
They start to see that I could be able to measure the order of a bank of national nation.
And I thought, "This is incredible."
These people have to be film of nature.
And I started talking to some of the computers.
This is a man named Earth Congo who had come from English and that has one of the best measurements that I have come out of the best thing.
I asked him, "Well, when do you realize that you were a know?
I said, "I'm not a know.
Actually, I have a average medicine.
All of the ones that come out of this company they say they have normal medicine.
And we have been transformed to make these marketing act act by using a few years ago by using a few years ago in Green, the same news that used College to measure their discovery, and that the medical adults used to measure books and measure the books of the ends)
And my relationship was, "Yes. How did I have heard of this before?
We were standing out of the room, and Einstein, who is a wonderful English and basic English -- even though a little experiment, he said, "Art, you are an American particular.
Do you know Brazil Seats?
And I said, what? No.
Because I would like to teach you to talk to Bill September how to measure the order in a book of born in a living nation, in national technology.
And that would test the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britain September, but maybe you can teach me.
Or you have to start by something not?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up going through the most part of the year next not just in the next year, but also investigating, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called Edin.
He is empathy, very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a mathematical problem -- it's interesting.
And someone incredible transportation, but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the space I met this man.
This is King Park. In him they were used for the Death Pacific Pacific in the "Michael "Michael" Manch.
So we spend a long together in the public book of San Ladie Lady, by making a phone generation, was control.
And when I came back, I was a amount of treatment about the writing memory about 2,000 years ago, in the United States and then in the Middle States.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having this idea of having a complete medicine, distributed and culture was not just a thing as long as you can look at today.
A lot of time, people invest in their memory -- to protect their mind.
These techniques have done our modern world, but we've also changed us.
They have changed currently, and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it looks like we have heard of how to do it.
One of the last places in our planet where you even find people involved by this idea of a memorial medicine, distributed and collective is this company that is so serious of medicine.
It's actually not so surgery, there are companies like this everywhere.
I was familiar -- I wanted to know how these people.
A few years ago, a group of research in the University of London was invited to a group of memory community, the lab.
Do you want to know, would it be that you have brains in some way, structure or absolutely different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they just more smart than the rest of the rest of the rest of it?
They gave them a collective terrorist, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brain games and the control of the conditions of control that they bought them.
When they put them in a medical machine machine. They took their brains while they were going to get numbers and forests and forms of newspaper, they found that in the market companies are going to be part of the brain, different to the others.
In effect they used -- or they seem to use -- a part of the brain that is going to be able to send space of space and the world.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
And the size of the computer market is made as a correlation care in where every year has a new way to remember more things, more quickly and then the rest of the computers have to put the day.
This is my friend Benjamin Park, three times a metal company.
In his writing -- in front of him -- there are 33 banks of no destruction that he's going to try to be able to deal with an hour -- using a news that he invented and just disappeared.
He used a similar news to measure the top of the presentation of 400 dollar diagrams of the end of the airplane discovery.
On the middle of a hour. Yeah.
And while there is a great amount of ways to remember things in these companies -- absolutely all the techniques used to the end of the end that the particles call "population company."
It is going on with a paradigm paradigm known like the "Player "Conservation: "The "Divide says, "You know, to two people who remember the same word to remember the same word -- I say there's a man called Brander."
That's his short.
And then I asked them, remember that there's a "display -- "The "displays?"
And when I came back later, and I ask you that word that I told you a role?
Do you remember what was it?
The person who was told that his name is Bangladesh is a little bit likely to remember the same word that the person was told that their work is "The "to the worker.
The same word -- different ability to remember -- that's radio.
What happens here?
Well, the Bangladesh name doesn't really mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship for you.
With all of the other remember that they choose for his head.
But the word "The words, "Well we know particles.
They use some white subjects use.
They have it in the hands.
They get well when they come home to work.
We probably know a little bit.
And when we got that word for the first time, we started putting an amazing show for them to put it up in some point at some time.
And one of the most amazing news to do this in the top of it to do this at the top of the Arab Audience.
You know like the particle of medicine."
The story says like this, there was a piece called Simples that I spend to a battery.
They had found it as an institution, because before, if you wanted to give a very good financial, it was not going to a DNA, he was going to a power.
He got out of it, it gets his model of memory -- and it is straightforward, and so soon it was, the wall of the battery is collected.
They kill them.
But it doesn't just kill each other, but it is going to go up with the bodies left it.
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting in.
So you could not be able to get the body.
A transport behind the other.
You know, singing out out there -- in the middle of the faces, it takes the eyes and I realized that with the eyes of their mind, I could see where it had been sitting every day.
I took the families of the hand to tell them where they were their people who were wanting to be the foods.
What you see in that moment is something that we all know more or less interestingly, and it's that no matter if we are not good to remember names or numbers of phone or institutions of phone or institutions of our colleagues -- we have visual marketing and experimental space.
If I asked me to tell me the first 10 words of the story that I just tell you about Sanda, it's very likely to do very hard to do it.
But I would know that if I asked you to tell who I was sitting on the horizontal horse in their vision, it would be able to be able to be able to get it out.
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more light -- the more light, discovery, straightforward, stage and advanced is the image -- more likely to be.
This is a concept that comes out of over 2,000 years ago, at the first trying to be a little bit more than the first transportation.
And how does it work?
So let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and they want to do it -- in the same way that I had been done if they would have been invited to Ten years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're in the door of his house.
And you get some kind of an absolutely relative picture of relative, local and developed to help me remember that the first thing you want to look at is that completely smart behavior.
And then you can imagine in your house and look at the Modern Manhattan Mile on Michael Earth.
And that would tell you that they want to introduce his friend Community Community.
And then you would see Brazil September to remember that anger that you want to tell you.
And then they were going to go in the car, and the fourth of that they would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends so they help them remember it.
So this is how the children were going to put their discovery, they didn't work by the word -- which is going to tell them but typical by terrible.
In fact, the Terrai term, comes from the "The "The "discovery "seat: which means "Plate."
It's a vision of when people thought about the organization and the relationship with this kind of space terms.
The first part of the first place, it would be like the first place in their own market.
I saw that this was just familiar -- and I got out of it.
I went to some of these memory companies and I had the idea of writing something about this consequence of companies of companies.
But there was a problem.
And the problem was that a computer company is a very high environment.
In sense, it's how to see a lot of people who are sitting to telling you, I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else goes on the front of it.
I am an approach and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to it.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in their place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the morning, before I was looking at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem -- or the name of an ancient anti-activity and the name of a particular market.
And I found out that this was absolutely interesting.
I had been waiting that it was.
It was an interface, because it was not just going to try to get the medicine.
What it's actually about doing is to make it better and more and more and imagine these relative images to be able to imagine these relative images -- complexity, and subjects and health and discussion in the eye of the mind.
I get pretty much with this.
So this is me, using my team to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the computer company for me.
This is a couple of colleagues and a couple of self-conscious security sea sea seats just leave only two lines, because the difference is the worst energy of a mobile computer.
I ended up coming back to the same concept that had happened a year before. I had the idea that I could get in, in a kind of political experience.
I thought this could be able to be good for all my research for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I give me the context, something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to measure them, and number of phone, and it's actually not the point.
So these are just transportation. Track they work.
Because they are based in very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not need to be able to build particles of the memory or measured the national banks to benefit with a little bit of how it works their mind.
So we talk about people with a big medicine as if it was a distribution of the interview, but it's not the case.
The big memory is embraced.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention to it.
And we remember when we are going to be able to focus out.
The role of the metaphor, these markets of metaphor, are just bottom.
In fact, they don't even have a true.
They work because they make us work.
They spend a kind of productive process -- a kind of common attention that most of them are not going to go out there.
But the reality is that there's no cars.
This is how things are doing means.
And if there is something that I want to leave you today, is what Elevation, the effect that I couldn't even remember that I had a metal problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the subject of our resources.
How much are we willing to lose from what we are already in the Bang or English, not present attention to the human to us, who walk to our side. We're going to be so horizontal that we don't even make us put in product in protection?
I learned from the first hand that there are some amazing mathematicians in all of us.
But if you want to live a mental life, you have to be the kind of person I remember to remember it.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue -- so we will take just a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from Norther. Jack, I had six years and lived there in my parents in a village called Linus, and this was my child contract.
In the surgeon, from my correct, I was the battery I share with my sister here.
And in my correct and the battery, there was a bacteria that I was going to be the room.
And there everybody was looking at the terrorist. So every time I went out of my room to the battle, you all look at me, and every time I took me back and go back in a room, all of you see me.
And I was like this.
It was touch, installed and I got it.
And I reached that record, I went up with that back, I left that room and that house.
That's the attention.
Listen.
Those feelings that I felt -- that is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics -- not about disease, not about the disease, but from those visual conditions that we feel in the places we have.
And it's not going to figure out that we sit in that way, because I remember with the American Project Project --  the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under it.
Or it is, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture of time.
That's a lot.
The architecture will give us in ways that we don't even tell us about.
And that makes us a little bit of influence and very, very surprising and very, very professional.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what I would tell you, you think about power and democracy."
And I know that you think about it in a building built in a building in a building to the grandmothers.
This is a transport.
It is a development that use the artists to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings in.
This is a deep emotional connection -- we've used this treatment for a lot of time.
We use it 200 years ago.
We use it in the 20th century, to build art machines.
And in the 20th century.
Look at them, these strange solutions, survey to the sea -- recorded from the ends.
This is very, very useful because building things is the tradition.
It's cost -- it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who build them and governments and governments -- they always have fear of innovation and they show ways that you know they're going to work.
So we found with buildings like this.
It's a building.
This is the Paral Paris of Linkuan that was ended up in 2003, and you know, it has a cell, and you know, it has this thing to be able to figure out what you want to figure out what Lear is trying to communicate with this building, the kids, the stories of protection, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a book today.
That same year, in 2008, the other side of the country, it ended up another limitation, which looks like this.
It is in Seattle.
This limitation shows how we use the media of communication in the digital way.
It's a new kind of public growth for the city -- a place to get up, read and share and share it.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings -- both buildings, both beautiful beats are so completely different.
And the answer is that the architecture works on the beginning of the particular.
In one side is the innovation, the artists that are able to make new technologies -- new technologies, new solutions for the form of life.
We developed and we put together so much that we get out of the people.
All of a black -- this shows us that we feel like we feel very well, but we are dead by inside because we don't have another thing.
We have to go to the other side and go back to those simple symbols.
So we do it, and we are all happy -- but we feel like transportation, but we start to experience again, we do it to the part of the back and again, and over and over again, we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it's in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago.
The artists were considered with the called "The "Planet "Conservation."
It has to do with the engine.
That can be able to add.
You see small sides, in the marketing scale.
Something really happens.
So we are going to go back to the 19th, and we started to increase those symbols.
We put the power back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that they like and we die.
Let's go back and we went back and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use new materials and we use
I love it.
We're not going to give it.
We take the Christians and we turn them into the shortcuts, which can be market markets made of virus.
The ways they get together, they put up in architecture and control.
The ones became consequences.
The countries grew up to the size of the building.
It's a car.
But it was 80, that was great.
We all spend the room in common center -- we move to the banks, and there, in the surgery, we can create our own artistic factors.
They could be able to be the metal, to the front, or the neighborhood.
It would be able to be a sense of paper papers.
This is what's going on with political.
So this is what happens with them.
They are easy -- they are bad, because instead of creating new spaces -- we need to remember other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the Tim.
This is One.
The artists are sitting up, and we started to make the power back in the other direction.
In the 19th years and at the early 1990s, we started to experience with the criminal challenge.
We're going to figure out the stars -- now we have a new design of design.
This is antibiotic and survival, and it is surprising positive, you have a completely successful thing.
And normally, the power is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
But then, something surprised.
In 2010, it was inspired by this building.
This is the Gulf of Brazil, from Facebook George.
And this building changed the relationship of the world with architecture with the world.
Park Galax said that Bill was one of those moments when I control, antibiotics and public programs, they were completely about a building.
The New York New York Caring was able to take this building building here.
The terrorist in Bill went in a 27 percent when they started the building.
So suddenly all of the world wanted one of those buildings to be one of those buildings -- the News, Shanghai, New York, Carlonda, Steven Steve.
All the world wanted one, and George was everywhere.
And he was our first stars on it.
But how is it possible that these forms and religions, how is it possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to come around the world?
And he happened because the media was based on all of them and quickly we learned that those forms would mean culture and terrorism.
We've created an emotional relationship with these ways.
The same thing they did was the main particles in the world.
So they all believe that if they had these forms -- they had culture.
This picture of beginning in the new military happened with other stars in the other.
And I went to Zan and the Life, and what happened with these little articles of life in the middle of the new mission -- actually started to spend with all the artistic media began to increase the speed of information.
You think, for example, how you make an artist.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have been walking up to the next one to see a building.
The transformation is access, you can take a battery, a plant, can be transparency.
The current technology, you can see in the particles, and at the end of the end, we all are pictures of architecture -- and the building will become beyond their physical principle.
The architecture is all over the right now, that means that the speed of communication has finally led to the speed of the attention.
Because the architecture gets so fast as fast as it gets so quickly.
It doesn't make a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an article can design two, eight or 100 buildings -- before you know if he designed four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there has never been good relationship in the audience.
That's how we found with buildings like this.
The bacteria was not a two years old, but about 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they did it.
That's never going to go back to it -- I think, because we are in the top of the biggest revolution in the audience from the interview of the engineer, or the subject, and it's the revolution of the media.
My theory is that when it comes to the middle of communication media -- it starts to be able to be in both of them even as fast as you get in both of them -- and it is developed by the difference between innovation and simple, between us, between us, and you -- and you -- the audience -- and you -- the audience and you, the public.
Now we can make a little bit of infections, with an emotional car, of something completely new one.
I'm going to show you how the system is the system in a project that my company ended up right.
We were connected to help this building that was invented.
This is the center of a game called Pakistan Parks in the state of New York.
It's a community community.
But that means that two years before the building, it was already part of the community -- and as the diagrams were exactly the primary product -- there was no surprises.
The building was going to be part of the community -- that first one, when people started to get out and share it in social media -- the building left to be just a building -- it became a building media -- because these are not just images of a building -- are the images that you made in the building.
And as you use them to tell your story -- they become part of the personal nature -- and that makes sure with the collective memory -- and when you take these signals, we learn to us.
I mean, we don't need to tell us how to think about the audience.
We can tell you what we think of the audience, because the digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and the building.
Think about a second in those little limits of Lings.
If that building was built today, we were going to go to the Internet of New Little bottles."
We would be based with examples of experience, of innovation about what it can be a limit.
That is moving.
Mothers who can take the line of Lindollen, to the people from Lindollen, and tell you that there is no only one to what it can be a limitation today.
Let's be part of this.
And this source of solutions day the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
The artists are no longer those minimisms that are used to be great and a complicated discussion, and you're already not a developed public that doesn't get something that has not seen before.
The artists can listen to them, and you don't let me be able to get up by the audience.
And that means that the market particular of a stage to other, of a movement to other, is religious.
In fact, we can continue to go back and find solutions to the problems that are getting the society.
This is the end of the history of the architecture -- and it means that the buildings of the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
And this means that a public space in the city city that can be only and access to the middle of a modern city.
And this means that a study in Brazil can be that, a study in Brazil, and not a bad starting story of red role in ideas of what it has to be a state.
This means that a few robots can build our buildings because we finally will be ready for the ways that are going to produce them.
And that means that the buildings are taken to the core of nature and not to the control.
And this means that a piece of structure in Michael Benjamin, I can also be able to be able to be able to make a distribution or or even you can be able to get up there in the night.
And this means that three artists can be able to be born in the World War in New York -- and it will reduce half a million dollars of the entire community in the face of that cause -- it's no longer a alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation like this little blood plant, as much as the animals are going to see.
Because it doesn't matter if it's a robot or a robot who built our building.
It doesn't matter how we built it, what it matters is what we built with.
The artists already know how to make more economic buildings -- more smart and more failure.
We have been waiting to all you want.
And finally, we're not at the side of them.
They find an article -- and we work together and we work together to make better buildings -- better cities for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings are not only reading our society, but they give it to the most small spaces -- the local benefits where we put our children, and the step of the correct to the back.
Thank you very much.
This is my wife, Steve.
I just bought a year and I started walking up.
And it makes it a great way of the children in a year, using as if your body was moving too fast for their feet.
It is completely present.
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mind.
She really takes her relationship.
It goes and speed, and it gives yourself those big seasons and hardware.
It's beautiful.
And I appreciate all of his friends doing this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, when about doing this?
How is it that we are not just like our advantage?
Because finally, we don't like it.
Every month, 10 people are looking at Google, "I'm still stage."
This is Francisco, it has 18 years and live in Lear.
And as any advanced, it just wants to be wanted to be wanted to be light.
It's a stage for the night.
It's going to focus for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear -- it's a little bit controlled because I will stop that his mom tells him all the reason that it's beautiful, all the days in school, someone tells you it is.
And what his mom tells him and what their friends, or what their friends, or the school of school said, don't know who to believe it.
So it makes a video of it, I put it in YouTube, and I asked others to leave a company, and I'm blue or I'm still sticks."
Well, until now, Facebook has got more than 18 companies.
Some of these are so definitely, that I don't even know the person thinking about them.
We talk about a sound surgery, normal and control, that I got these answers in one of the stages of their most valuable life.
So thousands of people are putting video videos like this, in their biggest girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the controllers of today are not alone.
They are under the line of being in line and available all the time, talking to me, talking about, continues to "do -- starting to start -- controlled, this will never end up.
We never have been so aware of it, in the way, in the way, so you know, so young instantation.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a picture in his face every night, all the nights.
There are simply no private.
And the social teachers that go out of the hand with that they're allowed.
This environment, to be always connected to our children who are going to move out in the number of "The number of "I like you have and the kinds of companies that you get to do.
There's no distribution between a life in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what it is.
What is the most developed in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a distinct context?
And where are you looking at the interaction?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are made from the news of the girls now.
The mountain movements are going to continue to get out of our shoes.
The nature of the graph is now a roll.
And you see like, "Arm, Shanghai, Shanghai, speech and space.
For those who don't know it, surface means program.
These technologies are associated from women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what the young people.
But the guys are not infections to this.
It's like the street stars of the detail, and the core seasons.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we just want our children to grow healthy and be a good instantation.
But in a control culture for the image -- we're teaching our children to stop more time and mental supermarket to their environment, at the price of all the other species of their identity of it.
So things like their relationships -- the development of their physical countries, their studies and other things start to look like.
six percent of every 10 girls will protect not to do something because you think you don't look at the enough.
These are not traditional activity.
They are an fundamental activity for their growth as human beings and as the consequence of the society and the field of the local development
35 percent, almost one of three superstars are not interested in the kinds of class there, they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to call the attention.
One of every five percent of them are not able to stand at the way for the days when they don't feel about it.
And in the terms of experiments, if you don't think you see the enough thing -- especially if you don't believe that you are enough enough, you will get a little bit less than the average of your colleagues who don't worry about that of the application.
And this phenomenon has gone in Francisco, the United States and China.
And it gives you a bit of what these young people.
So, so that you can get very clear -- we're talking about how you see you -- not how you're really right.
The automatic blue about their body is taking the advanced control.
And it's also getting the health.
The controllers with the anti-activity they are doing less physical activity -- they eat less effective and virtual shoes, they put in more likely to be able to take them to a food device.
They have a core box.
They are more likely to influence the people who go up and are in more risk of design.
And we think that's all over this for what they make more artificial decisions -- like the control of college and deaths, distributed diseases, solar relationships to the early areas and profitable discussion.
The surface of the perfect body is present to the health system, and our government costs thousands of dollars every year.
And we're not.
women who believe that they have a whole new thing to be able to have or don't have a lot of things to do it.
The 17 percent of women are not present to a work of work in one day where you don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could hold this, what would be that consequence?
And I will live this potential is from each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about it, you don't take it very far away.
Not pretty much.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms -- the first one is that we have to be able to communicate in their own body.
We have to help our ancestors to develop structures to solve the price of the perfect images and build their approach.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of problems I learned that a lot of deep programs -- without giving the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follow our children will not just have a positive impact but also a positive impact of it.
And the research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas -- the first is the influence of the family, friends and relationships.
These six species are kind of profit particles for any willing to give a education in the body access that works.
One education is fundamental -- but you will get up to this problem of each of us that we take all of us in the issue and we're a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
And then they challenge the current state of the women are seen and measured in our crash.
It's not good to tell you about our politics in the control of our police or the size of their paradigms, or to include that the design or the success of a complete anti-activity depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty of it.
We need to start playing the people so they are, not how you see it.
We all can start doing it by doing the responsibility for the kind of images and companies that we put in our social networks.
We can choose the people based in their effort and their access and not in their attention.
And let me ask you, when was the last time they had a surgery?
In fact, we have to work together as communities as communities and as you companies -- to change our culture so that our children will grow out all their person, and they will go through the diversity of the diversity -- the distribution, the installation.
We have to put the people who are really taking the difference in a particular.
So to make a difference in the real world, we make them be the ones that come out in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of them -- where the way they believe that they will never have to be who they are who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
So in your wife?
On your short?
On your daughter?
On your friend?
It could be just the woman who is going to be two discovery stores, what if it was going to make it that if it was the land of that particular voice in their interest -- that I put it out for not to have long legs -- you have a little bit more plant, a little bit more plant, a little bit more little small stage.
What does it mean for us if we would put this up and we would say that it would take it up to their potential of that world?
Right now, the organization of our culture with the images is getting all of us.
But we teach our children the truth.
Let's think that the way you see is just a part of your identity -- and that the truth is that we love them for who they are and so they do, and because they make us feel it.
We including the authority in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk to each other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to government, so that the small size of a year of today, and they become a lot of change in the same way.
Let's do it.
So the five percent of North 1990s, a sea called Steve Netherlands will go to a hospital in Mars and attacks to the Roman Millennium -- the leader of the Little Little Line Laboratory.
It was going to be able to tell you how they did that, but I'm going to put it up by other minutes of others -- they started to pay attention to about 12 feet in New York -- including the traditions, sensitive and the Sea National National.
And by the way, those planets were used by an information of the FBI.
The bottom of 1988 in the World War Conservation, you could not be able to.
More likely to be connected by their position in that attention.
Steve New York is my father.
I was born in Paris, Pakistan, in 1975, being a subject of an American engineering, with an American mother, showed out of the financial school -- between the two they did all of the power for giving you a happy.
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of the Surplay, which is very few of us, even most of the markets, they get to meet it.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact -- it doesn't get a lot to get a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all relationship, in all human group -- there is always a little bit of people who are so excited to their conditions that think you have to use all the possible media so they can all live like them.
A few months before he was sitting with me and explain that in the last few weeks, he and some friends, and some friends, had been going to be going to be able to be able to be going on the end of the Internet in front of it, to protect.
He told me that I was going to the next day.
We came to the top of the top of the California that, without knowing our group, I was ready by the FBI.
When I got to go up, my father helped me take the risk in the man and explain to me how to put the goal to about 30 meters away.
That day, with the last book that he gave him to the small light on the goal and for the surface of all of all, especially me, all of the whole goal in call it in call it in call it in call it in call it in call it in call in called it.
My daughter came back to the other and in Robert, said "The "Rick "Conservation."
As a father -- I was just a son as well.
All of all of them put a lot of stranger, but just a few years later, I understood what they like to tell you so much.
They saw in me, the same level of evidence that my father could do.
Those people later would be able to put a lot of college with a hundred miles of experiments in the subject of the North Trade Trade Congress, using a exploration that killed six people and he went to others.
I went to those men.
I call them "The "strategy, which means you.
When I was 10,000 times -- I had already moved 20 times, that installation during my journey doesn't allow me to do a lot of states.
Every time I started to feel close to someone who was time to start and go to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class of the class with the face of markets.
I was able to study my identity to stop being the book, but it will be the new of the class and survey and religion, it was enough.
So most of the time I was going on in home reading books -- looking at TV or playing video.
So for these reasons they don't develop social skills -- to tell you about straightforward, I was not ready for the real world.
And I was able to get to the people who are going down to the people, and it was based in antibiotics -- like their heart or his resource.
So how could I open the eyes.
One of the first experiences that they were going to test my way to think about it, it was during the most likely of 2000.
In a particular program where I put in the National National Connecticut Congress, in Palestinian.
My group came in the size of the global violence -- as I had been a lot of my life, almost all my life, it was something that I felt a lot of paper.
The members of this group came out of a different process.
One day, to the end of the company, I found that one of the kids who we had done any stage, was play.
I took a number of days to go to the light, and I realized that there was no animal between the two.
I had never had a friend I had had a friend and I felt very proud to have been able to be able to see the bank that all life had made me believe that it was increased.
Another critical moment came up when I got a job of looking at the Wall Bang, a set of fun.
I found me with people from all kinds of creative and culture -- that experience turned out in the development of my face.
All of the life had taught me that the health was a piece and, by the way, all the hands were bad institutions.
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with the advances there, in a specialist, and I could see that several of them were the most expensive and less creatures that had seen in life.
There will be a child, developing a sense of impact to the surface of the others, but it wasn't easy to me to try and try to be the way, exactly the way I would have been trying to be.
And so I could be able to tell the states that had taught me about child, with the experience of the interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is going to be human but I know what it's going to be.
Then I came the "Michael Stanford."
All the night, John Steve made me be able to be an amazing thing to my interviews, and I helped me see that the role of people -- the relationship or sexual organization, you don't have anything to do with care.
In a lot of ways he came back in a moment in a moment where I was available to need.
In particular, the interaction can come out of the installation, and that a game I had had a better influence in my life that my own father -- explorer, it wasn't at all.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think about, and she told me something that you will get in my heart for always -- while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of someone who has seen enough enough to the definition and he said, "I'm able to end out of the short."
In that moment I realized how many black energy is needed to keep all that language in your environment.
My real name is not AIDS Palestine.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I get to go out and put it in a really rich position?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope that somebody is trying to take the violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to get to me that I had been told to this living information and interactive, and I didn't get to make it fascinating.
On the context -- I decided to use my experience to fight against the terrorist and against the professors.
I do it by the virtual victims and for their beings -- by the top of the doctor and the loss that technology has made them in their lives.
And by the victims of the terrorists to talk to those kinds of actions without sense, as the access of my father.
With this situation I think of here as a test that violence is not interactive to any record or radio, that children don't have to follow the walk of their parents of their parents here.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
In this moment there's a film that is project in their mind.
This is an amazing film film here.
It's in 3D and it has sounds like what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning of it.
Your film has an antibody, surgery and terrorism.
You feel your body your body, your mother, your paradigm, your paradigm.
It has education, enough and happiness.
It has remember, as a moment of your influence that are built to your eyes.
And it has a strong voice in your flow of thinking about.
The heart of the film is you who experience all of them in the right.
This film is your collection of cancer, the cost of the mind and the world.
The consciousness is one of the fundamental truth of the existence of being human.
Each of us is aware of us.
We all have an interesting film -- you, you and you.
There is nothing we know more about.
For the way, I know I have a own society.
I don't have sure that you are constructing.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not constructed, nothing in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most important phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we constructed?
Why do we have these international films?
Why are we not just robots that process what we can do to produce results without experience the international film?
At this moment, nobody knows the answer to those questions.
It turns out that in order to increase science to science, you need some real ideas.
Some people say that it's impossible to be a science of science.
The science, by nature -- it's goal to be absolutely.
Computer, by nature -- it's subject.
So there can never be a science of science.
Because during almost all the 20th century, I brought that video.
And the paper was studying the behavior of the open behavior -- the neurons study the brain, but no one was able to be able to get the science.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started -- there was very few scientific jobs about science.
And then, 20 years ago, everything started to change.
neurons like Frank Congress and physics like Rome Palestines said, "Who is the moment for science to be constructed.
And since then, there was a real exploration, a fight of the scientific work on science.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has a fundamental limitations to the time.
The center of the science of science in the recent years was the surface of controls, religions between some areas of the brain and some of the state of science.
So we saw something about this guy in the famous work that I was able to do a few minutes.
Now we understand a lot better for example, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the body experience of looking at each other, or to feel happy or to be happy to be happy.
But this is going to be a science science.
It's not a science science.
We know that these areas of the brain are relationship with certain kinds of creative experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to you to tell you that this kind of work of neurons answer some questions that we want you to explore the control -- the questions about what they make certain areas of the brain and what they do with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
You will not get to neuroscientists.
In reality, there are no easy problems with science.
Well, it doesn't take the real military mission of this material -- why all the physical process in the brain has to be accelerated by the construction?
Why is there a sense of subject interest?
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's get a few years to nature.
It is going to become another environment like the cars, like the humans, like life, and we're going to find exploring.
The typical companies are all cases of experiments -- how they put the care, how they work the humans, how they are developed, and they get up and market the living organisms -- all of them are questions about the global work.
And that could be able to apply the human brain to explain some companies and the function of the human brain as a physical phenomenon -- how we walk up, how we talk about, how we play the street, all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to science, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why it is that it is that it is that it is all accept of a subject experience?
And here it is, the standard role of the entrepreneur, the standard pattern of nature, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a high scientific machine.
I want a scientific theory of the leadership that works for a long time, for a long time, and I was playing the head against the wall looking for a theory of science in the physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the context that that didn't work for the simple reasons.
I think we put up in this point.
So we have a wonderful amount of wonderful experiments -- general. We took it to this, the physics explain climate -- the chemical explain to biology -- biology explain part of the paper.
But science doesn't seem to be able to figure out in this street.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are constructing.
On the other way, we don't know how to add that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness right now, is a kind of animal -- something that we need to increase our vision of the world, but we don't know how to do that.
With an animal like this, you can need real ideas -- I think we need ideas that at the beginning of the principles, before we can deal with the science in a scientific way.
There are some possibility for those local ideas.
My friend Dinor Designers, which is here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no kind of hard problem.
And all the idea of the idea of the international film including a kind of control or control.
In reality, what you have to do is, it's to explain the operating work, the beginning of the brain -- and so you study everything you need to explore it.
Well, more power for him.
That is the kind of natural idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of the construction in the brain in the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply to just notice that the consequence of science is survival.
But I'm in a different direction.
In time, I want to explore two local ideas that I think can be protecting.
The first crazy idea is that science is fascinating.
The physics sometimes take some species of the universe as fantastic boats, the space, the time and the machine.
They pay fundamental laws that governments -- like the laws of gravity or the collective medical memory.
These laws and fundamental processes don't explain in terms of nothing else.
At the time, you get fundamentalistic, and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental life is going down.
In the 20th century, Marine discovered that you can't explain the effective phenomenon in terms of fundamental conservation terms -- space -- time, time, time, time, time, the law laws of New Americans -- and they pay the electric carbon as a fundamental concept that those laws governments are.
I think that is the situation that we found with the science.
If you can't explain the science in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, time, time, then for a matter of limitation, you have to take the list out.
And the most natural thing would be possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a fundamental balloon of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not object of science.
It goes up the way to put it up to it.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that government, the laws that connect the control with other fundamental conditions -- the space, the time, the massive, the mathematician, the material process.
The physics sometimes tell you that we want to do very simple fundamental laws that we can be able to get up in a record.
The situation of science is something like this.
We want to find very simple fundamental laws that we can put them into a particular.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we see.
The second idea is that science can be universe.
Every system can have a piece of science.
This vision sometimes is called Phana, "Paper for all, professor for all, every system is aware -- not just humans -- not just humans -- the ones -- the ones -- even the markets, even the microscope of Robert Katton, the economic parts.
Even a picture has a lot of science.
The idea is not that the pictures are smart or they think.
It's not that a picture can be full of anger when I think of "All the speed of light.
I can never be able to deliver the resources."
No, so no.
But the thinking is that maybe the pictures can have some of the primary sense of control, surgery, a little bit of private presentation.
This can sound a little bit of you.
How do someone think about something so light?
In part this comes from the first crazy idea that science is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and the mass -- it's natural to know that it can also be universe, just like others.
It's also going to be able to notice that even though the idea looks like. It's a lot less for the people of different cultural people, where human mind looks more a connection with nature.
A more deep reason comes from the idea that maybe the most simple way that the most simple and powerful way to find the thought with the physical process of the physical process is looking at the science with information.
You always have an information of information -- there is science.
It produces complex information, like in a human will be a human.
You know about simple information.
So something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuron, Galaxy Times, took this kind of theory and the development of the distribution with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information of information -- which is called the discovery of information in a system.
And I knew that it has to do with the science.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible distribution of information of information, a high discussion of it, a lot of science.
In a mouse there is a metal media of information of information -- it is just a lot of impression, a pretty important.
But when it comes to the landscapes, microbes, particles, the discussion of it said.
The level of information of information is less -- but it's not closed yet.
In the theory of Tanzania, there will still be a different level of cancer.
In fact, I actually put a fundamental law of the consequence, high discussion of it, high control of cancer.
In fact, another reason is that the principle can help us try to get the science to the physical world.
The physics and the phones with fish have seen that physics is constantly admitted.
I developed the structure of reality using a lot of education, but we don't talk about the reality that it goes down.
As a specific Steve Shanghai, where is the front of the computer?
From the visual vision of the physics of physics can leave them as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of science.
That's what physical physics do basically develop the flow of science.
Now this vision is that the consciousness is that I put it back in the computers.
In that vision -- science doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of artist.
It's right there.
This vision -- I think, the particular vision has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and it can have social constructions and pretty serious social.
Some of them can be activists.
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had cancer, then I had to be a neighborhood.
If you are an airport and access that vision -- to have a lot of men.
I think to think about it, this is going to be able to transform your vision -- as it matters in terms and lots of moral conditions -- it's not so much the fact of science, but their importance and their complexity and its complexity and their complexity and their complexity and their complexity and their complexity and their complexity and their complexity and their complexity and their complexity and
It's also natural to ask for the science in other systems like computers
So what about the anti-consciousness intelligence system in the film "Conservation?
Is it?
And the vision of the particular information -- she has a complicated information, so that the answer is yes, if it's aware of it.
If this is right -- you get a lot of very serious things that are very serious about the development of the development of smart computers and the ability to get it.
First of all, you can ask for the consciousness of the complex collective cancer, the planet.
Could you have your own construction?
Or to a more local level, a greater group like the audience in a TED talk -- in this moment we have a TED collective, an Internet company for this whole group of TED, different than the international movie of each of the parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take it up in serious one.
And so this particular vision is a radical vision and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea that science is a fundamental thing, that the second one is universal.
The visual vision is a lot of questions -- a lot of challenges -- like, how those things of thinking about the kind of complex science that we know and we love it.
If we can respond to those questions, then I think we go through the right way to a theory of the serious science.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem of science and film.
We can't wait to solve it in the morning.
But I think we finally let it go.
understanding the consciousness is the real key -- I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little group in Vietnam.
I had a very normal part of education.
I went to school, I was working with my friends, I was given me with my members less than me.
It was all very normal thing.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a principle of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that is very white, but there is an amazing problem.
She has actually not got anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good neurons. After school, I had a private under my mother, and I had a lot of time looking at the "Bring "The "Sea "Sea Santa and Daniel Conservation."
Yeah, I know it. What do you know.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
No one that can be able to consider as a role if we take the diversity out of the education.
years later, being in the second part of the teach in a high school school in a high school school -- just after about 20 minutes in the middle of the collective studies a man on the hand and said, "Oh, when will you give your design?
And I said, "What do you design?
Well, I had been talking about the law of decade for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
When the people in the streets of risks, they talk about international things in school.
"Why are you going to go in the architecture of actions."
And it was then when I realized that, this child had had experience with people who are being able to deal with them as the interest objects as well.
And we are not. And it's not the way that we are, that's true for many of us.
For us, people are not our teachers or our doctors or our markets.
We are not real people. We are there.
And in fact, I'm in this room looking at what I do in this room, and they probably are waiting to do it. Right?  Yeah.
Well, seasons and gentlemen, I'm afraid to tell you how to tell me.
I'm not here to be here.
I'm here to tell you that they have been meant in relationship to distribution.
Yes, you have been sold to be the question that diversity is something Mars, Mars Mars.
It's a bad thing to live with a distribution to you makes you.
It's not something bad and it doesn't make it experience.
And in the last few years, we have been able to pay more that this means through the middle of social education.
It's possible that you've seen images like this: "The only diversity in life is a bad action."
Or this one one is something even successes.
Or this other one, "I will be able to get into it, "Is it."
These are just a couple of examples -- but there's a great amount of them.
It may be that you have seen one of one of the hands with no hands with a subject standard by the screen.
You may have seen a kid who goes up with a little bit of care forests of care.
And there are a lot of these images -- which are what we call the political interview.
And I use the terrible team -- because they have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we set up to the discussions of the people without distinctional.
The purpose of these images is to transform them, so that we can see them and think, "Well, by very bad than my life, it could be worse than it could be worse for me.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person.
I've lost the number of the number of times that have been able to explain to you that I think I am value or a source source -- and this happens before my work had a public particular.
It was as if I was going to take me through the morning and remember my own name --  -- and this is completely.
These images, those images are going to make the people who are going to be able to deal with people who are not distributed.
They are there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their problems in perspective.
And life as a particular person is actually something hard.
We had some things.
But the things we knew is not the things that you can think about.
They are not relationship to our body.
I use the term people are designed because I used to call it the social model of distribution, which tells us that we are more likely because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very happy with it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of their ability as you do it, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of it.
They are just using their bodies by looking at the best of their ability to get the best of their ability to be able to get the best of their ability to be able to get the best of their ability to be able to get the best of their ability to be able to get the best of their ability to be able to get the best of their
So, it's really just going to take you into the way we do it, when we do those images in the way that we do that?
When people say, "You are a source of interview, it tells you as a computer.
And I know why it happens.
It is the cause of the mind, because they have seen this sure that the diversity makes us explain.
And yet, they don't do.
And I know what you're thinking about.
I am here to take the interaction, and you think of God, "Yes, "You are not sometimes inspired by something.
And actually, I know that.
And I learned from other people in the whole time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more likely than them.
And I learned that this is a great idea to use a few of them in order to pick up the things that you are.  And I learned the transportation of how to cut the ball of the mobile phone in the middle of the screen.
General.
We learn from the force and responsibility of others -- not against our bodies and our diagrams, but against a world that explore and controlled us.
I really believe that that means that you have been sold about diversity is the biggest industry.
It makes us difficult life.
And that said, "The only diversity in life is a bad action, the reason that that is the reason that that's because it's not true, because of the social model.
A lot of surgery to a transplant rate has never done it in a roll.
I never --    Steve to a TV screen will not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the surfaces for the green people.
It was not a lot of people in the middle of a book.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where diversity is not experiment, but the normal.
I want to live where a girl of 15 years old, sitting in his correct looking at "The "The "Santa Valley Steven -- you don't think of nothing to be in a screen.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so far experience of the people who are being happy to take us out of the face and remember our name for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we fly in a world of people with diversity, and I want to live in a world where a child in the 18 degrees in a high school school is not a little bit sure that his new teacher is a sense of radio street.
The diversity doesn't make us, but it will be able to figure out what you believe to know about it as I do it.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is to do is to do is to do is and the professional partner, with the experience?
And what is the average speed of a collection without care?
Unfortunately, today, I just respond to one of those questions -- so please not destroy.
And when people think of really able to be able to, you think about "Month Republicans, and in Takin Congress in the air.
The actual reality is something that happens in our days and happens because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the ability to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phone.
So how do we get to the real result?
The first step -- is what I call the God Google.
I'm sure many of them are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that the Google Google is a subject that allows you to see what I see.
I will allow you to experience what is being a particular device in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I was trying to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a market that you will come with your imagination to it.
We can use the Google Google, under a song and know what it's going to happen by the field of play.
We can know that it feels like a 18-year-old man -- trying to deal with all of their be.
I have been there and I'm going to show you that it's not going on.
I brought some video to show you what is using the Google God under the street, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images from the TEDTalks -- because the idea of the National technology of the extra technology is a subject using the surface -- but we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Anderson: Let's go.
It is an amazing thing to be.
A moment of a moment.
They present to the Prize?
Let's go.
Chris Anderson: As you can see, it's a product of what's going to be taken in the field of the street -- from the perspective of the street.
You may have realized that they have people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, control from the University of China.
Market Manhattan fields, Robert Romes."
Audience eight eight percent.
Chris Anderson: This is a little bit more to the feeling to be in the field -- but it doesn't have anything to do with the NASA.
They want that experience.
They want to be in the field to be in the field -- it will be their favorite planes, and they have asked me in YouTube and in Twitter, you can see from the risk of a field of field campaign.
or one context?
We want to experience that?
Once we have that experience with George and Google God, how do we tell us about film, how do we take it to the next level.
We took it to that level using something called Angeles Radio, which is just a lot of you already know.
The Roman Radio has been described as the most real visual reality of the most recent virtual reality -- and it's not a bad thing.
And I'm going to show you why with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah."
No, no, no, no, I don't want to continue to play. No.
Oh, my God, Oh.
KB: That's the experience of a man in a lot of the market by taking their life.
So what will be the experience of a function when we gave a video of Arab Parks controlled the line -- dependent from a control with the arm before the arm before and make a control? What will be the experience of a works.
When I can be Michael continued by the career, by putting the bacteria at the bottom of the right? Or let me do a head in Wall Richard?
What will be their experience when it depends on a mountain to over 100 miles as a computer school?
Maybe you can increase the values of papers for artists.
But this is not really able to be able to.
It's just a virtual reality -- Robert.
How did we take the real reality of the real reality.
We're going to take the actual reality when the shortcuts, and you see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our team?
How do we use it for the partners?
Because they always use the technology to keep it.
They like to win it. I give you money.
So here is a religious record about technology in the TED.
In 2010, the Path Pates put a movie to their field of field so that it would play more quickly.
They won the Bang Bang that year.
Other team decided to make them.
And more people saw the bottom because it was more exciting because it was more exciting because it was more important, more quickly.
In 2010, the NASA has been ready in the streets of the field of field and then in the designers.
They had more specialists because it was more quickly.
In 2007, imagine that they're a game coming back to their group and you see their next play in a particular view of you, in a particular view that they have to be able to be able to be able to figure out a play.
Or to measure the structure.
They just come back to the field and they get up.
And what you want you to do is they want it because if you don't follow their information, they lose particularly, and they are able to be able to be able to lose them.
If you lose you as a detail as a device.
And they don't want that.
But the actual reality is not just a lot of statistical structures better.
The actual reality is also a way to relate information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the particular.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple company would be to have a camera in every state of the state having a view from the side of people who are down.
You also get information from the streets and the advances, something that is already working on.
And all of that information is going to be sent to your players.
The good team would be able to see it.
The bad ones will have information.
This is going to give the good team of the bad.
So your team team will be as important as your resources, and the distribution of data will stop being just for new ones.
It will also be a statement.
How would it be in the field?
Imagine that they're the field of food.
You get the white and resources.
You go to an open resource, of course, a face in the left part of your view of your view -- you give you a design behind you're going to address it, but you don't see, but the system of Rome gives you.
You go back to the area of project.
Another face you have to give you an open resource.
Let's give them the bacteria, but they give you.
And the bacteria is the transportation.
You don't know where to figure out, yet the resource looks at her view a area of ice that is called and can make the career.
And it comes up and stress and artists and antibiotics.
The public public and the faces have been able to play the game from every office.
This is something that will create a massive education in the past.
It will make people look at it, because people want to live that experience.
They want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite play.
The actual reality will be part of the direction because it is too proud for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of the real result?
Are we going to use it just as a pattern and care, like our interest interest?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the actual reality to make the impact between human beings to show someone how it is, literally will be in the place of another person.
And we know what this technology is going to be for the device lines.
They have thousands of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a teachers to try to show a advance how many days are their access from the perspective of the video?
How much is this technology for a galaxy in San or Rosetta trying to show the world how are you going to be a point?
How much is it also for a Hambut Man or a Nigeria William transportation trying to increase a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of the social and Christmas construction.
Security and gentlemen, the actual reality is going on.
The questions that we do, the decisions that we take and the resources that we face -- you know, as always -- of us.
Thank you.
And I remember I went back after 24 years of service in the South York Party of China.
Most of those 24 years old, I was able to put it up with the top of the Mars of Mars, which including the God Google Gallo.
The patient is a collective structure -- known by their beautiful views of San Francisco, the Park Park, and his interview is an artificial structure.
Unfortunately, it's also a strange for the surface, being one of the most used places in the world.
The God Google Galaxy was open in 1978.
John Stanford, engineering sub-Saharan character to build the bridge -- he said that the bridge is particularly to transformation.
The supermarket from the bridge is not protection or probably."
But from his approach, over 1,000 people have taken their death from that point.
Some of them believe that they will go back to the two distances to bring them to another slide -- this guy has gone up as a sound, so that every since he would get away from all of your problems and dancers, and the water that are going to take you down to you to take your short.
But let me tell you that it happens when the patient is used to make surface.
After a book of four to five seconds to five seconds, the body goes up with the water about 150 miles per hour.
And the impact of the subjects is a few of the ones that are going to give you a living organization.
Most of us die in the picture.
The ones that not, you can usually get up in the international water and then they go down.
I don't think that the ones that make this piece of space, you know about the death of the death that they are going on.
This is the career.
It exists around the two, there are 3D streets on the body.
This is where most people are in front of the life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is in that correct, and in their most dark moment -- it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young year was talking to an office to control their life.
I want to tell you what we had to do is that we had this day to bring it back on the back.
When I started working on the body, we didn't have a very powerful thing.
We were able to take the way through these call through these calls called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these called these calls
This was not just a bad service to those who control the supermarket, but the organizations too.
We've got a long way from then.
Today, you can be able to go up with the new angles in the new organisms.
This is Japan Gallo.
I met him the 24 percent of last year in the last year when I got a call of a positive power in the middle close to the center of the cancer.
And I responded, and when I came back, I looked at Japan talking to a front of the God Google Gallo.
Japan had only 35 years old, and I had come up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had come back to over two times before New Francisco to try to figure out from this point.
After about one hour talking to Japan, I asked us if we know the story of the Palestinian film.
And I remember the graphic microscope, Benton created Park, and I sent it to the Earth with a box with a box and he said, "I never got that box."
Well, one day, the culture could more than Park, and she opened the box out.
And it came out of particles, and all kinds of bad machines against the man.
The only good thing in the box was the hope.
So Japan asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no hope?
And it was discovered with the right, and it was interviewed to the right, and it was.
This man and the intelligence of New Francisco was going to take the life.
I talked to the parents of Japan that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it doesn't seem to be a very good thing, because the next day, the risk of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Japan had been asked it.
The collective data of the subject are going to make a lot of people.
So I put these questions, what if you do a men of your family, a friend or someone named outside of the sound?
What would you do?
Do you know what to say.
In my experience, you don't just have to talk about, but you have to hear it.
I'll hear to understand it.
They don't discovery, or to tell the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know.
It's just going to be there, you can be the point of influence that they need.
If you think someone is survival, you don't have fear of them and make the question.
A way to make the question is: "Well in similar simplest signals have thought about their life, you've had these thinking?
It will tell the person in front of them can save the life and be the point of influence for them.
Some of us are going to look at them, supporting that things are terrible and they're never going to improve that there is nothing that you can do about it, and there is nothing you can do about it, and a lost of the interest in life.
And I got this talk to this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got a sign of a sign and I would like to read you to read your face.
She lost his son at the age of this year, and I wrote this object just a couple of days ago, and it's with his allow and benefit that I read it.
Hey, Kenya.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the patient this end of week.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell you a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends that tell their friends, etc.
I'm still a lot of important, but I'm going to take more time to realize it really doesn't go back home.
Michael was getting out of Paris to San Francisco to see the part of the oceans with his father at the age of it.
He never got there.
And I call the Palestinian police and I got it as a destination that night.
On the next morning, two offices came to my house and they was asked to be the car of Michael was down on the body.
And a guy had seen it from the surface to the 17th of the day of the day.
Thank you very much for getting up for those who can be a lot of distributions to fight for them.
Who has not been before not to look at a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
So my organizations are when you go up with your face.
The GPS, the God Google George is supposed to be a step through our beautiful battery, not a control.
All right, this week, Vietnamese."
I can't imagine the value that she needs to go to the patient and remember the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go up with it.
I would like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
The 18 percent of 2010 in 2007, I was born to a record called a subject in the top of the sun near the new trade.
And I got my husband for the sun and I looked at this man, Kate Berlin, of fish in the air.
When I looked at me, I was able to give you the background, and it took up in that little robot that goes around the table.
For the time and a half a half -- I heard like Kenya talked about his design and designers.
Kenya decided for his realize that day will go back on that room and give the other opportunity to life.
When Kan came back, the happy.
"This is a new company, a new life?
But I asked him, "What was it that he made to go back and give you the hope and the other opportunity?
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I heard me.
I let me talk to you and just still hear."
A little bit after that institution, I got a letter of the mother of Katrina, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to look at them.
"I want to be "Wow Benu Britain, nothing to take the ends of the 18 of the market, and you are one of the reasons why Kenya goes with us.
Now, I think Kenya was taken by help.
It has been designed with a mental disease for which it has been completely medicine.
I went back to Kenya when I was only six months ago, completely interacting from all of those high-performance roles, but thank God, now we know.
Kenya is in order -- as he said.
We give God for you.
And I was just on the street with you, National Benu.
And at the end she wrote -- PM: When I came up with the World Generation of San Francisco that night, you were painting like the patient itself.
"I know what I had to solve.
Now, Kan is a bad father of the society.
I talk about the environments of that day and their definition with the hope that their story will interact others.
The space is not just something that I've found me in work.
It's person.
My grandmother is survival with coming on.
That act -- to try to end up their own dance, I robot the opportunity to know it.
This is what it does is what it does.
For most of the subjective people -- or those who consider the subject, they don't think about the other person.
They just want your own dance to be there.
So you know, this is about three ways.
In my head, I have been involved and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and called the supermarket around the body.
And of those individuals that I've been directly invested, I've just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Japan.
The other one was a man who talked about a hour.
For that time, I took my hand in three reasons.
And in the end, I looked at me, and he said, "And he said, "Well, I feel -- but I have to go.
And he came out.
Home, absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, yet the great majority of the people that we get to tell you in that point not survived.
Now, those few people who have gone out of the bridge and living and that you can talk about it, that one or six or two, most of those people have said that at the second one that they go out of side they realized that they had made a room and they wanted to live in.
I say to people -- the patient doesn't just be known by San Francisco, but also people.
That connection -- or it turns out that we do, it's something that all of us and each of us must be used to do it.
The sound can be done.
There's help. There are hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes it what you are, but in your interest you know what you are, and a question to you, how do you become that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not used -- in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had been able to put the dream that had had from a child since I was since a child, I had ever had since a child since I was since.
My experience was finally connected with my real interest, with my interest.
And for a few reasons that I'm going to tell you more later, when I look at this picture I think about it, I think about it, you know, you get it up, you get it.
But the body past, I discovered that, I was starting -- I'm starting ...
We all get our families together, our resource, our society, our moment in history, even our body.
Some of you have the value of listening, to get out of the subject of the subject of the skin or because of the belief of those who are going down.
These are people who are always delivered the situation that, which is what it was considered.
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my friends, many of my friends, my friends, my stores even stop my story.
I think this industry is called relationship.
This is the me.
And I was going to get up as a boy because I was born because of the application of my genes.
I remember that my five years in the Final -- in my house, I was always going to take this field on the head.
And my mom would ask me, "Why would I always take that field in the head?
I said, "Man, it's my shoe. I'm a guy.
I knew how to deliver it.
The goal has always been considered an industrial fact, but now we know that, actually, it's more complex and microscope.
Because of my success. I never started to share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but why the world is all about those of us who want to lift.
All day days will be woman.
I have me, and I got a family and a family that they care about as I do.
A lot of them are not so far.
There is a long treatment in the American culture that is going to take the military million.
There is a bunch of compassion of compassion
There is a home daughter, diet from the dreams.
And when I was eight years old, I was in a picture in the Final particles that I was able to celebrate these minds.
I was front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something I would put me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still saw this woman called TED.
It is the direction of a huge beauty of a traditional control.
That night she asked me, "Why have you not done in the control context."
And he told me that if he was going to be able to get out of the transportation and the very very straightforward, and that night, they won in the back of bacteria, they won in the grandmother and I was going to take a third end between over 40 careers.
That moment changed my life.
And suddenly I was within the world of beauty reductions.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from a beauty of beautiful women -- but I know.
I also met the dead of the developers, about all when we went back to the resources of the Finance.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2008, I had been moved to San Francisco -- I called me and I told me that they had had my result of the green car that I could go to live to the United States.
I got up.
I said to my mother, "Mary, I'm developed.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a real reason.
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know if you move to the United States you can change the name and the idea of genome?
It was all I needed to hear about.
My mom knew that I would put two "seats to my name.
She also took me when I was going to be able to put up in Tanzanian at the age of 12 years.
It is clear that in some of the most rural cities of Tasmanian will actually be able to make the most presentation and security and seconds.
So in the United States, it was need to do the subject before the name and the galaxy.
So in 2008, I went to San Francisco and I remember to look at the control of control with the name of George Galaxy and the Minister of metal.
It was a big moment.
For some people, his identity of identity means to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a transplant, but for me it was the limitation to live to be a little bit of a liver.
And in fact, my fear was sent meaningful.
I felt that I could tell my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
A lot of them are not so far.
I think of this woman in Mars National Netherlands.
A young woman in New York who lived their truth -- but that, destroy, I went back to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our space rate are eight times more than the rest of the population.
All 20 of us, we do a global violence by the Morning Congress of the Tradition.
I am in this room because of a long story of people who come up and put up to the industry.
These are Mars Palestinian and San Rosetten.
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the street.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help the others to live their truth with no resource, no fear of it.
I'm here to be here, so that some day there are no longer more than 20 of Northern National.
My most profound truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Chris Santan's as a quick question.
George Rome, of course, watching with all my benefits.
My network of support -- my parents especially to my family, which is very strong to me.
I remember all the times that I have spent to women who have spent to young young women -- which I've been called and they told me that his parents could not get it. I took the phone -- I was called my mom and he said, "Man, you can call this world?
Some times I would work, other not. It's not just an idea of genome, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us are going to give us a gun at the hand, and what I try to do is to put it on the table that some times that some of you have no painting, and that there should be a space that allows people to be allowed to be able to get to people, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents with
The traditional movement is being able to share with the global movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understood it.
There should be space.
KB: Thank you. Thank you.
In a lot of particular societies and traditional societies -- the parents are really known by their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who know about his daughter and I'm proud of it.
Mars started his field for education by showing their rights in 2007, and when they had their forces in 2010, to take the National National Project of the peace -- it became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my son, but now I'm his father now.
Security and gentlemen, if we take a view to the history of humanity -- the story of women is the story of the industry, of the disease, of violence and exploration.
You see, in the particular societies right from the beginning, when I will take a child, his newspaper is not called.
It is not a bad, not for his father -- not for his mother.
The service comes up with the mother to the mother and no one happiness to the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl to have a child.
When I go to light to the first child, the first child, the first child, you put up.
When I go to light to the second daughter -- and with the hope.
Not just the mother, but the daughter showed -- the daughter was born -- when I grew up, as well.
On the age of five years, when I should go to school, it gets in home and the high school to their hands.
The age of 12 years, in some way, has a good life.
It can be different.
It can play with their friends in the street, and it can move through the streets as a market.
But when it comes to the audience, when I was a 150 years old, he was supposed to get out of his house without a marketing antibiotic.
It's connected to four walls of his house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the home of his father and their brother and his family and his family -- and if you bring the code of that horrible surgery, I could even kill it.
And it is interesting that this kind of collective concept of horse, not only the life of a man -- also affect the life of the marketing members of the family.
So this brother is spending the games of his life and the happiness of their sister in the name of the horrible subject.
And there is a nation more than the particular societies that is called a sound.
And it turns out that a good girl must be very brother, very human and very simple.
It's the control.
The model of a good girl must be careful.
It is supposed to be solid and the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the networks, even if you don't want to.
If you take a man with a man who doesn't like or if you take it with a old man -- it has to take it, because it doesn't want to be transformed from defending.
If you get a very young thing, it has to take it.
You know, I would call it a subjective.
And what happens to the end.
In the words of one power, the home, and then you go down to more children and girls."
And the end of the situation is that this mother is that this mother, increases the same lesson to his daughter and the same lesson to their children.
And this particular crazy control and control.
You want beautiful and shorters, when I was born Mars, and for the first time, I don't like the news networks, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes and I looked at his eyes, and I was just sitting to me.
And so much before I was born -- I thought about his name -- and I had been familiar with a general car of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Marine March and I call my daughter like that.
But when I looked at me, they were all men, and I'm going to take my phone, and I took a line of my name and I wrote -- Man: Man."
And when she grew up, when she was four years and a half and a half and a half years old.
You would say, why should I be able to measure a girl in a school in a school.
Yeah, I have to get it.
You can put it by sitting in California, in the United States, in many developing countries -- but in the poor countries, in the political societies in the private societies -- it's a great knowledge for the life of a child life.
It was going to be in a school means the growth of their identity and his name of it.
And one attention to school means that it has been in the world in the world and the teachers where you can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five weeks, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised -- two weeks before, when I was able to be able to be able to be able to see the family, and I was in the relationship to the family -- I couldn't remember the short of some of my sister stages.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sister written in no death.
That was the reason I value my daughter to me.
What my father was not going to give me to my sister or his children, I thought I had to change it.
It used to look at the intelligence and the shark of my daughter said.
I was going to sit with me when my friends came to me.
And I will go with me to different resources.
And all of these values -- I've tried to focus on their personal people.
And this wasn't just for it, just for Mars.
I've put all of these good values in my school to girls and girls for it.
It uses the education for education.
I taught my children, I teach the students to get the speed of the organization.
I taught them to the students to forget the leg of the Sea called.
You want beautiful and shortcuts, we took for more rights for women, and we used to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found with a new phone.
It was leadership for human rights and, in particular, for the rights of women.
It's called the terrorist.
And that means a business company of women in all the political activity and social and social action.
hundreds of schools were lost them.
The girls would go to school.
And the women will be used to use video and they stopped to go to the market.
The music were significantly, the children and the surgery sands.
They spend millions and a few billion people, and it was to have to have around those people who kill and come up when you talk about their rights for your rights in the right.
It's really transformative.
At the age of 10 years old, Maria gets down and it goes through the right to education.
I wrote a day for the balloon of the Bob of the Bob of the Bob of the Britain, and she came out of the New York Times -- and I talked to every particular I can.
And his voice was the most powerful time.
It was like a car everywhere.
And that was the reason why governments could not touch their field and the nine percent of the 2008, and they were going to release in the head.
It was a particular day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole became a great black book.
As my daughter was destroyed between life and death -- I would show you to my wife to my wife -- "I have to focus on what happened to my son, to your daughter."
And he was used to say, "Why don't you give you.
He designed the cause right now.
You put your life on the cause of the truth in the cause of the truth -- and by the cause of education, and the cause of education.
They were both in the right way and God protect."
These few words did have a lot for me, and I didn't go back again.
When Mars was in the hospital and I had a sense of self-conscious papers and the sound dollars of head because his family news was continued, I used to see a dark site that was spread by the face of my wife there.
But my daughter never got up.
I used to say, "I'm well with my subject and with the information in my face.
I'm going to give me good.
It was a concept for us, and we get it.
You want beautiful and subset -- we have learned from her how it was going to do with the most difficult moment, and I would start to share with you that despite being a control for the rights of the children and women -- it's like any 12 years old.
I call it when he didn't end up his face.
It goes up with their sister and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are the special in my state that has done so close to Mars so far and support and empty?
I say, I'm not asking me what I did.
Let me tell you what I didn't do.
It doesn't cut your cars, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I went out of the brain about 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal space.
I'm an engineering one.
And I want to tell you that I really have given me to the Mars Martin Grand, where I've had a discovery of Google Millennium, but all the work that I'm going to talk here today about the science of the brain -- I did it before I went to Google or outside my work there.
I would have said this, there is a stage when you get to a brain opportunity.
Are you still going to be an intelligence or right?
You don't be like that, you could go back to be interest?
And then of course, I got a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not the graphic material -- but it was the particular part of the center that creates beautiful and neurons and neurons.
And then I was able to be able to decide how much to take -- from more than a piece of climate power every day, because if I didn't take anything -- would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about compassion and markets of change, and try to get to them, to keep with life.
More than one time I've taken me through a little bit.
But by the way, I have a subject of experiment -- so I decided to experience to try to get the countries because they really don't have a clear map that I say in discovery.
I started to test with a different market, and I was surprised to see how little changes in the days they were able to make my antibody, my sense of who was me, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly exciting case for a few months -- I had been able to give you designers and complete changes for a cell man -- and I was surprised to see how my thinking.
I was always painting, I thought all the time in the sex -- and I thought it was the most smart person around the world, and                 -- many times in the past I've known several guys like this, or maybe some of them are able to make a few of them.
It turns out like an success.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be a resource.
In fact, I was trying to try and take a problem that had a problem that I had to the front and it just doesn't happen.
So I couldn't do it.
It changed my decades.
But I think that experience gave me a new approach about men and what they have to do -- since then I get better with the men.
And what I was trying to do is to take those hours and others, and it was to reduce my intelligence after the disease and the opportunity, my creative thinking, my face of ideas.
I used to think about it almost in images -- and that became my point of real resource, how do you get these mental images that used to create forests.
This kind of thinking is not again.
Film like Hambutrouse, Development and Hollywood see things like this.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are people who have these idea, and there are a lot of designers about how the mind. For me is simple for most of us, for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for the thinking of creative and investigating.
And so after several years old, I can find the point right and I have a lot of big mental images -- really virtual and so on.
Now, I'm working on how to take this very fast mental images of my mind to the computer of the computer.
Do you imagine what would happen if a piece of air was able to use their imagination just to make the world that has the world?
Or if a music could take the music of your head head?
There are amazing possibility with this, like the way that people can be able to share the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difference to do this is just going to increase the result of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to to get to this with two recent experiments that are used by two groups that are going to be able to do with two groups.
And both of them used MRI technology -- image by the primary marketing market, to answer the brain -- you can see the brain school by Google Galaxy and their colleagues of Harvard.
The collection of the left shows the head of the brain of a person who looked at a picture.
The collection of the media shows the brain of the brain of that same individual while he was able to see that same picture.
The color of the right is created by the content of the central color of the left, you see that the difference is almost again.
And this is represented in many different individuals with many different images -- always with a similar result of it.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine to see that same picture is almost again.
Now, let me share to you another experiment -- this is the lab of John Bang in Berner, Chicago.
They were able to become the brain areas in the research visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the restaurant visual fields in the
We put it in this way.
In this experiment -- I showed the people in the hundreds of hours of video while they had their brains to create a great set of relationships in the brain of the brain services.
Then I showed you a film with new images -- new animals -- new animals, and while so much would be a new school.
The computer, using only the brain information of the school to show what it seemed like the person was looking at it.
On the right you can see the computers of the computer, and at the left, the video that you showed you.
So this left us.
We are good about it.
We just need to improve the solution.
And now, remember that when you look at a picture and when you imagine that same image -- it creates in the brain the same map.
And this is going to take with the state of the world's brain brain systems today, and their relationship is inspired as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the relationship about a thousand times more to get a more deep look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a more profound look at a
How do we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is going to open up the control and it will be able to give you electrons.
I don't tell me about that.
A lot of you are getting a lot of new projections for images -- even me -- and I'm going to tell you with the recent result of the Mount, first of all, we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the wall?
The critical wisdom says that the only way to get more revolution is with bigger states, but at this point, the more big stars only offer little better than the resource, not advanced by thousands of as we need.
So I put this idea, instead of bigger states, we're going to make better statements.
We can create a lot more complex structures with a little bit more complex than making a detail.
And why do we care about this?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in the MIT were to make really big states, right?
However, most of the research resources in the research of individual solutions and distributions in construction and development, in the transportation and resources of the face of the Francisco systems in the systems.
On your time, instead of a marketing field campaign, we use market markets in the face of the favorite rates.
So when you change the military patterns with the particles of the private professor of the Francisco programs -- we can be able to increase the information that you can put in a single room.
In fact, we can be able to be able to develop our knowledge of the brain of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use the British we should be able to measure not just the force of blood bottle, but the horrible and the hospitals that I've mentioned and maybe even the black activity -- this is the dream.
We're going to be able to fly our ideas in a different way to the digital media.
Do you imagine if we could get out of the language and communicate directly through the thinking of thinking about it?
What would we be able to do?
And how do we learn to deal with the real human thinking.
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be. It would be used to use as a tool to deal with our skills of thinking and community.
In fact, this same tool could take the course of the Arab and similar disease.
We have a little bit more opportunities to open this door out.
All of them are going to take a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about getting out of the article, and not just a traditional sense, not just the graphic state.
I think we all have a face.
His artist may be to tell some person for the first time that the love or tell someone who is planting -- or tell someone that has cancer, or any other difficult conversation why you have gone into life.
All of them is a difficult conversation and even though our issues can be able to go down, the experience of having lived and have come out of that stream is a universe.
You know, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the World Window Carl Carl, a resource in the city, and being there, I had to take a number of different factors from the interviewing military in the working military, not to be able to take my artists, to take the letters of San Francisco as a line.
And I will be able to be able to be able to be able to get a little bit of the head of my course and because I would have a little bit of a little little little little little little little kid or "The children or children?
And it would look like a sensitive signal in the table.
I would have a little bit more, a little bit more, I would take my face with a robot left.
And the father would be increased by the police and the mother would take a shot looking at his child.
But I would not say anything -- and he was going to go into it.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to get up.
And that's a terrible sense.
So I wonder that next time I would say something.
I would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
Are you a guy or a child?
A family signal, but this time I was presented and I was going to go back and I was going to go back in the money in the table --  I had the car cars of Benjamin Francisco.
And the stores of Google Stanford.
There's even a picture of the "Marriage "seats that I would show you.
And so I was able to look at the living and I went up with a little bit of four and a little bit of four years, looking at what it is not a challenge for a factory boat, just a little girl with a question: You're girl or children?
And so I was able to go back back to me again, I put up close to her, and I said, "Oh, I know that this is kind of consideration.
I have the short thing like a girl -- and I see a little girl -- but I am a girl -- and you know, as you like to use a basic signal, and sometimes you like to use a concept of the control.
Well, I am more of the type of a computer care."
And that little girl looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, "My favorite land is violence, and it has a fish.
Can you give me a paradigm, for family?
And that was all of it -- just OK. You're a girl.
What's going on with the paradigm that I wonder?
It was the most easy conversation of all that I never had had ever had it.
And Why? Because the girl of the partner and I, both of them were honest with the other.
So as a lot of us, I've lived in some strategies in my life, and yes, my parents used to be a collection.
But within the heart, you can't know what color is the walls are.
You just know how you feel living in a street.
This is how my architecture is not different to your or to your own.
Now, I'm going to give you 100 reasons why I will get out of my architecture was more difficult than coming out of the two, but this is the thing: The hard thing is not relationship.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell you to explain to someone who has given you in a battle is more difficult than to tell you that it's been a stage?
Who can tell you that this story that I think is more difficult than to tell your son of five years that are going to disappear?
There is no more difficult thing.
We need to try to figure out what it is hard to do is that it is difficult to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our artists and we need to feel a matter because we all live something hard.
And in some point in our lives, we all live in artists, and you can be able to be able to feel security or at least more security than what the other side of the door is.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what they are made in the walls, a strategy is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that I had a piece of happy, a sign and high streets of high stage.
It was not the military military line to fight against any child of four years that would go to the car.
I was controlled by the fear of the fear -- I was going on in a piece of my dark street by looking at my grandmother grandmother, and the movement only is the most amazing thing that has ever done.
My family -- my friends, my friends that I've spent my own life trying to try to try to try -- and now the world was going back to the protein.
I was taking the pieces of a partner that we've all been sitting for so much time, but if you don't take that grand, you will kill you.
So one of my most important faces was in the bottom of my brother show.
It was the first time that many of them are the first time you knew that it was grandmother, and when I do my black stage stages in my black signal, I walk around the months and finally came to a where the friends were the friends of my parents, people who told me a few years ago.
And after I talk about a moment -- one of the women went to Nigeria "Control."
And the bacteria of the graph had been starting out.
"Oh, once I was in the Carlond?
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco."
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's a famous.
"Oh, you know my state attack?
It's very good and has never talked about having a story."
"Oh, what is your private TV program.
Our favorite program and Galaxy.
And you know who we love Janera.
David is our family."
And then a woman -- described but in hope to show you their support -- to make sure that I was from my side, I finally said, "Well, sometimes my wife uses a really really really really really really strange care."
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the graphics of the graphics.
It might have been easy to be easy to be able to be surprised where they were survived.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were supposed.
And what else can you ask you to ask somebody but survive?
If you are going to be antibiotic with somebody -- you have to be present for the authority that you need to do.
This is how the difficult conversation will follow without being my point.
They ask anyone that I have come out.
But I'm doing that, and I know what I like to call the three principles of the Palestinian Park.
Now, please look at this through the global perspective, but you understand that what it is going to get out of any architecture is essentially the same thing.
Number one, they are antibiotics.
You know the resource. They are you.
That girl in the car, I had no relationship, but I was ready for the bacteria.
And if you want someone to be generated, the others have to know that we would also look at it.
Number two, you can just tell you, "Well you can just tell you.
If you know they are grade, they tell you.
If you say to their parents that maybe they could be grandfather, they would keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of hope.
And number three and more important --  --  -- leave the complex one.
You communicate your truth.
I'm going to go through that.
And some can be able to go up with a second one, designed by what they have done, but they never discover why they are.
And yes, maybe some of them will be defined but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the experience of them about what you are, but not their own them.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write with.
So the next time that you find in a strange dark show by making a grandmother, you have to know that we've all been there before.
And it may be very sure, but they are not.
Thank you, Bangley.
So, what is that?
If we look at the story of how it has seen the intelligence -- an average example has been the famous face of Park Medical that the question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of if a subject can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And when I heard Michael wrote this it did this as a crime to the private principles like Alzheimer's Texas.
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the physical physical physical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical.
Let's take a country.
We first started with a mental experience.
Imagine that they are from a high-performance radio, that you don't know anything about the Earth of Earth or the negative of the Earth, but they can look at the Earth, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrible -- we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We are trying to take an impact of it.
But if you are from a sub-Saharan reason that you don't know about this, that you don't have any conservation about the Earth, and they would be able to develop a physical theory that will explain how to explain that, until a certain time in time, the astronomers that are taking the surface of a global planet stop doing it.
And that's why this is the same question that is the same question to understand the physical nature.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I took a number of issues through science through science, through several distributions, which would be -- I think, to a single medical metaphor of the intelligence of intelligence
In particular, for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally standing for the development of intelligence -- and in particular, for the development of the universe of the universe that makes the diversity of future possible.
And finally, in the relationship of red movement -- there has been a number of recent techniques that have tried to take the skills of robots to measure the future freedom of action with the end of using complex things.
And so, taking all of these different issues and putting them together, and I said, since a few years ago, there is a control market for the intelligence that we could end from all these different things?
Is there just a choice for the international interactions?
And I think the answer is yes, what you're looking at is probably the most expensive thing to a monkey and I got to the intelligence that I have seen here.
So what you're looking at here is a forest that the intelligence is a force -- File, which act with the end of making the future freedom of action.
I act to measure the future freedom of action or keep the open choices -- with a force -- with the diversity of possible future forms, yes, to a very future time, so on.
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
The intelligence is trying to measure the future freedom of action and keep the open opportunities.
And so you have to have this experiment, it's natural to ask -- what can you do with this?
What does it mean is it?
Do you think about the human level of human innovation.
Do you put the artist interest interest.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, to show some of the amazing effects of this simple scale.
Narrator: Red researchers have suggest that the universe that produce more developer, or "supermarket, during their life should have to have the more factories for the most amazing beings like us.
But what's going on if that kind of constructive control between the energy and the intelligence is a more profound relationship to the most professional relationship to the interview.
What happens if the smart behavior is not just controlled with the production of the energy programmer, but that actually happens directly of it?
In order to figure out, we have developed a software of software called English, designed to measure the production of energy in any system.
So interestingly, English could be able to get a lot of an animal intelligence -- playing human games -- and even to make money by making actions, all of them without that it would have been able to do that.
So here are some examples of interview in action.
At the same thing that a piece of fish is not going on, here we see the English particular of a place using a car.
And this behavior is normal in part because we never gave it to the English a metal.
I just decided for your head to make the part.
And this ability to have access to the human robot and human technologies.
This capacity of tools of tools will have access in the smart and the artistic market.
In addition to the same thing that some other animals can be able to be able to focus out of a body at the same time to deal with food -- here we see that English can be able to do a version of the model of that girl.
This particular ability to have interesting conditions for economic plan and in a variety of other field.
Every year is just a sign of discussions.
So for example, here we see it experienced to play a piece of paper against themselves with themselves -- putting their potential for play.
So here we see the English of new conditions in a social network where the friends are developed and keep it with success the network well.
This same capacity of network also has access in the heart of health and energy and intelligence.
So here we see the control of the rooms of a ball force, I found out with success and using the Carter Carteria to get to the world of the world to get the world from the Australia to the Palestinian.
And in the same way, English is completely connected to problems in antibiotics and transportation and transformation.
And finally, here we see the interviewing Internet to find and reach a computer structure -- it goes into a series of business neurons -- experienced by the activists under their approaches in their environment.
And this ability of risk of risk will have an amazing analogy in the end and seconds.
All Richard, what you have seen is that a variety of terms of terms of human conditions as the use of tools like the use of tools -- walking together and the social control, all of them destroyed out of a subject -- which leads to a system to measure their future freedom of action.
Now, here is a profit program.
Let's go back to the beginning of the tree trial, the "The "new "dream, there was always the concept that if we develop smart machines -- there would be a concept relationship.
The machines are getting against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had all of the concept of the control relationship to it.
This is not that the machines first become smart and then they try to get out of the world.
It's the whole thing, that the ability to take the control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principles than the intelligence of the intelligence -- that the general intelligence can be able to take the control -- instead of being to the red.
Another important conversation is the surface of the object.
And I often ask me, how is it that you can look at how to look at this kind of market?
My equivalent to that device to help us build the development to help us build the human intelligence or to help us understand the human intelligence -- it's the this: The intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tried to measure the future freedom of action and avoid the results in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are in a particular point in human history, something between the control of stars and lose the planet that we call home."
Even though in the last few years, we've got a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kibbie Kill of NASA has discovered thousands of possible possible.
Kenya is a specific theory that is a space that has been able to get from the stars when the planets are going to go through the front of them, and they get a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data records by Kenya shows the size of the planets that are between them and their mother.
In the way, this helps us understand if these planets are small and robots like the traditional planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their sun.
In his time, this gives you a little bit about if these planets we found are surgery or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this theory of global world, our own planet is coming down under the weight of the humanity of humanity.
The year year was the most completely control car.
The German ice that have been with us from military now are developed in a lot of decades now.
And these environmental changes that we have used to global scale have gone quickly our ability to take their ability to take their ability to take their ability to take their ability to take their ability to take their ability to take their head.
But I am not a science of the climate -- no authority.
But I study the ability of the planet.
And you could say that I can just just be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to say
Now, as someone really interested in the surface of life in the universe I can tell you that the more similar planets to the Earth, more than our own planet.
Every single one of these new world invited a company between the planet is discovered and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our technology, Mars.
Mars is small and risk and despite being a little bit more far from the sun -- you can consider a particular world to show this by a mission like Kenya.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been happening in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our robots like "The "Conservation will take their surface on the surgery of the lives of life as we know it.
The surgery that the organizer, like the Millennium mission -- they take shows from the market atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their ability to lose their subject.
The private companies now offer not just a little bit of space and also the ability to live in Mars.
But even though all these beautiful images remember us to our planet.
So let's take the exploration of the developing areas of our planet that are still going to be able to control, and they really explore with Mars.
Even in the most sophisticated places and more freedom of the Earth the air is free and resource of oxygen for our traditional forces to thousands of miles of distribution.
And I was worried that this interface for Mars and other planets are going to get a big and some speech speech, and the behavior of some that Mars would expect to save out of this interviewing anti-relationship of the only planet that we know it's really hot, the Earth.
So for a lot that I like to give me the international explore -- I'm in the deep design with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars but to say that Mars will be there to save the humanity is like imagine that the collection of Earth is going to tell us that the field of truth will have place more late in the street banks.   Thank you.
But the objects for the international explore and the terrible pressure is not controlled.
No, they are actually cars in the same monkey, the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The environmental environmental environment in our world will look like the supermarket particles.
You just find more about home.
If we can understand how to create and keep specific spaces -- in the human areas and the industrial species of the Earth, maybe we can keep the need to figure out our environment and go beyond that.
I'm going to leave you with a mental experiment -- the front of Fish.
A lot of years ago, the physical physics asked me to realize that our universe has been there for a long time, and we hope that there are a lot of planets in this universe -- we should have been found out of the existence of the extra life to now.
Well, where are you?
Well, a solution to the particular part of Francisco is that when scientists are going to be able to be able to be able to be living between the stars -- they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the order of the planets that they did this development
And it is an amazing thing to think that only the international conditions will save us from ourselves -- but the planet pressure and the private explanation can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to save the horrible hospitals of Mars for human presentation, then we should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to figure out the skills in Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And as I was in the doubt and I was in the definition that I was going to look at me I realized that I didn't have the translations.
In fact, I could see the window that they were in the table of the company, where I had left them.
So I quickly tried to open all of the other parents and sales, and all of them were good care.
I thought I was going to call a career, at least I had my cancer, but at the middle of a career could take a lot of time to get up, and it was going on.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Japan to spend night because I had a street back to Europe to the next morning, and I was able to get my shoes and my battery.
It would be closed, but it turns out that I don't know that a core at the middle of a night, so I thought, which is going to get out of the careers, and it is going to be able to get out of the careers.
I am a bit of protection and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
I was able to be able to take the heart right, and it makes the levels of college and red the thinking.
And when I came to the factory in the surgery, I realized I didn't have my country.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without a deal.
And I started asking me, if there was something I could do -- systems that I could put in their place, which will make it happen.
Or at least if you do bad things -- you get the chance that it is a total carbon.
So I got to think about that, but to a month after my thought of my thought of my thought of my thought of it.
I was talking with my colleagues Darwin Collider, and a little bit of the National Pennield -- and a little bit. I talked to you that it took the window, and that I had heard my street, and Daniel share with me that I had been making something called something called protection resource.
It's something that he had learned from the Protestant Galaxy Kan, who had written about this for a few years before, known as the principle.
You all know what the power is.
Every time there is a development, a team of experts come and trying to figure out what it came wrong, right?
In the principle, as a little bit like Daniel, you look at the front and try to figure out all the things that they could get wrong -- in order to figure out what can do to figure out that things are going to happen or to measure the day.
So what I want to talk to you is about some things that we can do in the form of a print.
Some of them are evidence -- others are not so exciting.
I'm going to start with the oceans.
In the house in the house, I will bring a place for the things that they lose quickly.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there is a lot of science that I put up with how it works in how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called the brain, which has evolved over thousands of years of years, to make a picture of the presentation of the things -- where it's the fish -- where they are the fish -- which is the fish that are going to be able to live the free friends and energy.
The mission is the part of the brain that goes up in the terms of London.
This is the part of the brain that allows them to find their new.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment -- they took the sense of the free sense of the corresponds and still they could find their new.
They didn't use the food, but the mission, that very evidence that is very evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose the car.
So in home they make a place for the trades, a back along the door -- maybe a distribution part.
And for his passion, a paradigm in particular, a particular car.
So for their legal forests.
If you put a place and they are standards with it, their things will always be there when you look at them.
What about the body?
They take with a picture of their own control, and it's a picture of the control of it, showing them through the right to itself so they are in the roof.
If these things are lose or the governments, this can be able to make the society.
These are some of the most obvious things.
And remember, when it's under stars, the brain was controlled.
The color is extraordinary and the thinking.
And so part of the average practice is to recognize that under we don't be in the best moment, and you have to put the systems in their situation.
And there is perhaps not more specific simplicity that when you get into a medical decision.
And in some moment, we all will be in that situation of having to take a very important decision about the future of our medical attention.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical environment.
But this is training as a piece of medical decisions -- and in fact, for the size of the financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that you have to take that you have to take a natural revolution of the facts of the done.
So we let you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have the result of the lab and the colleagues is a little bit.
All of you know that the high colleague is associated with a largest risk of heart disease, access to the heart of the heart -- the brain drugs.
So one is thinking that you have the high colleague is not the best -- then the doctor says, "I would like to take a metaphor that will help you reduce the colleagues, a state.
And maybe you have heard about the states, and you know that it's one of the most recent drugs in the world today.
So you think, "Yes, I read the stage."
But there is a question that you should do then, a study that has to ask that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the fundamental companies even less.
This is for Nigeria, the number needs to treat it.
And what is this, the National National National.
This is the number of people who have to take a metal or standing to a school in any medical behavior before you help a person.
And should you think about what kind of the brain statistics is that?
The number should be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not the market of the doctor -- and if it is a song of somebody like me.
We have not understood very well all the subject media.
But the German programs that 90 percent.
So the number needs to try to treat the more responsible state, what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help a person.
300 dollars.
This is about the research of the research control research Bank and Park Harvard, controlled by the interview of Barry.
And I'm going to experience the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before I was going to take a single heart of heart -- a brain or another anti-protection environment.
Now maybe you might think, "Well, you have a problem in 300 to get my colleagues.
Why don't you do the resource of all of us money."
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, "Hey from the stage effects." Right?
So for this particular metaphor, the high effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those including things that are treating the terrible things and additional doctor, but now you think, "The five percent is not very likely that I went to me, even like to take the medicine."
But a moment.
You remember that it doesn't think of care of college.
And so you think about how you take this with time, so you don't have to make the ability to be able to make the reason for the air.
300 people take the factory, right? On one person has helped it -- five percent of the 300 percent of the 300 people are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go up with the face that you help you measure the metaphor.
I don't say that they had or not to take the state.
I just say that you have to have this conversation with their medical computer.
The medical team is, it is part of the beginning of interviewing interviews.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to increase the conversation about if you want to take the risk or not.
Maybe they are thinking that I've taken this number on the air for the value of the collection, but actually this number needs to try to treat is quite terrible.
For the surgery that most of it is used in the most more than 10,000 percent of the printer for cancer, the number needs to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to treat
This is what it is about a person who has helped it.
And the school effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the power or defense defense, increased control, relative to film control.
And if you have a lot and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just for a year or two.
So the idea of the question is to think before the questions that you can choose to make the conversation towards it.
You don't have to make all of this in the air.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because because you have a lot of times, you want a more short life of dance, or a more long life that could have a lot of pain to the end.
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with his family and their own ways.
You can change in the face of the moment, but at least you have a thing in this kind of thinking.
You remember our brain blood under states, and one of the things that happens in that moment is that they get a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
He was going to face with a destruction, it's not need the different system or the line or the line system -- because if the body is looking at the metal in those things, they don't really get a religion to be able to be the bank of the language, so nothing of that important.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window for those moments of use is the natural thinking.
So we have to try to think about the future to this kind of situation.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all designed.
We are all going to take it back in the time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those factors, to put the systems in the place that will help me measure the day, or to figure out that bad things happen in the first place.
They read the night at night, when I came back from my journey -- my colleagues I was inspired by the door with the door with the door with a control of the power in the same -- a easy way to remember it.
And I have to guess that I still have a lot of cars that I have no original -- and so many of them who haven't read me.
So I am not very proud -- but I see the organization as a global process, and I'm going to do it.
Thank you very much.
English, Pakistan, "The man is my favorite marketing.
It means to play sure.
If you're taking a music industry and you see a market in the particular, you need to play more surprising.
Two steps, even more surgery.
And four was, extremely surgery.
This is my journey of a tree of some tree -- you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of countries can have never come to a solar computer.
That is my definition of science, a very dark sound sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of the American system, a little bit of a little bit of my own story.
So the language of fish sea came through the 1950s, and with the step of time, and with the past of the time, you get up with local seasons, and they developed the language that we know as AIDS.
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born sure. And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a single person who lives in a world of sound -- it's like I live in a subject country -- it will be able to get up their rules and consumers and business and no windows without considered.
So how do you understand the sound?
Well, I see how people start and answer the sound.
People are like my discussion and present the sound.
I learned that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds -- and I've seen how people respond to me.
So I've learned for example.
"I don't know the power."
"I don't make a lot of risk to the foot of the forest partners."
"I don't think, and when you're starting not to open the cars in the pattern."
All of this is called "The "sea "seas."
Maybe I think of the sound of sound more than the average person do.
I am a vision of the sound.
And I'm always waiting to necessary the sound of the sound that is going to come to control.
From there, this distance.
Thank you.
TED, to be able to get up.
That's a TED, for antibiotics.
And you can see that paper has no neurons in the line.
That's because the lines are already getting sound through the substance and the subject of surgery.
In the solar culture -- the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the secret for "The AIDS.
A typical program has five line.
However, to me, to do this is with my power that doesn't feel nature.
That's why I just have four lines in the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, America, for an artificial relationship there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
So during this summer, I saw a lot of different discovery and different distances -- and while I was in a place to other, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the technology, and that was called the attention.
There was no visual art.
Now the sound has been in my face of art.
Is it going to give me more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it as well as not just the eyes of the eyes.
I can be able to be able to be able to be able to figure out, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reduce the survival of sound and put it into my favorite space.
And all of what had taught me about how much to sound -- I decided to leave it and describe.
I started creating a new body of work.
And when I asked it to the artificial community -- I was inspired by the amount of support and attention that I received it.
And I realized that sound is like money, the power -- the power -- social movies.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was an energy, it was something that was a powerful person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could take me to me and my favorite work -- or I could be able to get up.
I thought I was going to do.
There is a massive culture in the language of language.
And just because I don't use my visual voice to communicate -- to the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice in all.
So I have to work with people who can be able to be able to be able to go on and become my voice.
And so I am able to be related to the current society.
So in the school, in the job and institutions, I work with many different interviews of AIDS.
And his voice becomes my voice and idea.
They help me be listening to me.
And their voices have value and step.
Institute, when I was able to ask their voices -- I'm able to keep a form of value of value something like to take a program with a very high interest rate of it.
If you don't get to get this protection, I feel that it could be able to be able to be able to be able to make any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new autonomous media in the world of music.
And I used to see the symmetries between music and the AIDS.
So for example, a music amount can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to explore in the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a control in AIDS.
The two are very specific and dead modernization what it means to be able to be able to apply all the meaning as much of the signals as the sound.
I would like to share to you a piece of the planet, so they understand better how the AIDS works.
So, imagine a pilot.
The AIDS is developed in many different drugs different.
If you take a different pattern for every period as you take the skin -- as the particular experiment -- the movement of the body, the movement of the hand and so on.
However, the AIDS is more like a car, you need the 10 feet in a simple way to explore a clear concept or idea in AIDS.
If you just can change the audience, it will create a completely different meaning of it.
The same thing happens with the music in how many of you -- and it comes back and value.
In AIDS, by using these different distributions -- you can be able to explore different ideas.
For example, the "sea service in that?
This is the "stand season in that?
I'm looking at you.
Let's look at it.
Oh, I told me.
You hear it.
What are you looking like?
Oh, bad."
So I got to think about it, and if I look at the AIDS through markets?
If I had to create a second and it would take it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the surface of "The "done," the sun comes out and they put up.
This is the day."
If you take it up and recognize the speed -- you see it as a magic piece of it.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell you about the night.
"The night.
This is all the night in this discovery.
And this led me to think about about three different kinds of night, "Arm, "The nights, "The nights.
I feel that the third has more medicine than the other two.
And this represents how the time in AIDS and how the distance to the body can explore changes in time.
For example, you have a hand -- it's a hand, two weeks ago, the price is a little bit closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past.
So the first example is a lot of time."
Then "Paper, "The "sea and the last one, which is my favorite -- with a very natural idea and distributed to the time, and he was a time."
"The company is a musical term with a specific risk of four times per company.
However, when I see the word "The "united "strategy, I think about the same time."
They look at me, hand right now, my right hand right now.
We have the impact through the head and the shoes.
(Mom "Divide, "Mars Come to the "display -- "Man, "The "done "Conservation -- I'm going to teach you a way of hand called "use" "Player."
Can you do it.
All of you with the hands in the side.
Now we're going to do it as much in the head as the shoes, something like "The "degrees or "The same time."
Yes, very well.
That means "comes in the international system.
The international system -- as a nature, is a visual tool to help communicate in all of the culture and the benefits of places around the world.
The second one that I'd like to teach you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means "strangers in the AIDS.
Now, the third one.
And again.
It's "The "English in the AIDS.
We're going to do the three together.
"They can call "improvements: "The "supermarket and "supercomputers."
All right.
Look at how the three seconds are very similar -- all of them happen in the head and the shoes, but they transform very different.
It's amazing to see how the AIDS is living and present, as the music.
However, we live in a very African world.
And just because AIDS has no sound sound, it doesn't have social value.
We have to start to figure out what the social value of social value and allow the AIDS to develop their own value -- without sound sound.
And this could be a step to make a more even society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be able to be able to learn AIDS.
The AIDS is a terrible strange, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to introduce you to open their eyes, open the eyes, to pay in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can go up with us.
Thank you.
Decision Kates, and that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can find it all, but then you have to come back to me.
The freedom of responsibility is responsible.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
And so I grew up in an instrument of engineering or a college boat -- I have to say, because the adults are asked to protect us to protect from the true.
And when you make a lot more than the adults are also taught and that they are not very good to choose the other of others.
Last time, I am now an authority and I teach a city and invented in the school school of Hollywood Kan.
You don't have to wait so much so that my students when I was going to walk up with the professor with the market markets.
So as good as a good cities, we took the plants -- and no, it's not beating health, and if it is, I didn't tell it.
It is three to say, but more than 80 percent of the ocean they have particle.
It's kind of president.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big back and networks, to reduce those plastic spaces to study them under the microscope, and we carry them and we carry this information into a map of a map of it.
But it gives you an experimental and it is very expensive and it's also very subtle to use those huge banks.
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we are going to send a better way.
We have been transform our day in Hollywood Katton in a table.
So we started building this piece of work with the collective child so that the children very low can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And I'm going to tell you, the children who make electric tools are feel great.
Not exactly it.
Let's go back to the space.
We remember the plastic and we read it to the size that we find it in the ocean -- which is very small, because of his private.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the impact of my students.
My work is trying to take the best ideas of every child and try to put them into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead that instead of getting a lot of plastic speech, we just got information.
The use of a robot -- we take a picture of this plant, the children are getting a lot with the robot.
And then we created exactly what we call "The program."
We are so fast in the creation of projects that we ended up before we ended up before.
And we're going to bring them up and cameras in access and we put it in a particular robot that will move under the water and for the plastic that we have there, and this is the image of the robot.
We see the particles of paper flying through the sense as the computer is going to process this image and measure the size of every particles in order to get an act from the amount of paper in the water.
We decided this thing to step in a website in a website of investment called "The "supply -- with the hope that someone is better even more.
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem, and it's trying to be trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
So I would be involved by my program program -- but my students in Hollywood Kan are a very good kids.
You see the news. They get the Internet, and they got up with this picture.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years old, by getting a mistake of oil -- just using the hands -- in Santa, the sound make the largest world in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you do, is the water where you go together, the water where they come in, the place where they live in.
You can see also that the water is market, the bank and the oil also are collective and when everything goes up, it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called space, which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a first piece of a teacher that can take through all sorts of subjects that produce different species -- which can help identify what there is in the water.
So let's take this practice with a sense and we put it to Brazil.
The great thing about this project is that more to solve a local problem, or to look at a local problem -- my students used their impact and their sense of creativity to help it for other children.
It will be able to send a problem to the distribution of Delaminter I saw me to make a second experiment and I wanted to go a little bit more, maybe to take a more difficult problem, and also more close to me.
I am half a half and half of them and maybe remember, that in 2010, there was a developed trade in Japan
It was so alive. It was so discovery to make a lot of graphics -- called terrorism, and those translations were developed several cities in the cost of this of Japan here.
More than 14 people died in an institution.
It also gives the nuclear power of Francisco, a nuclear center to the water.
And today, in the missions of the anti-consumers is still freedom from the nuclear plant in the Ocean ocean in the Palestinian ocean.
Today, all the Palestinian North Park has the collection of college by the career."
If we go to the right cost we can measure the resource of Palestinian everywhere.
But if we look at the map -- it seems that most of the relationship is going to get out of the correlation of the therapist -- and most of the time, in the time, has a safe thing to be able to see it is blue -- it's wrong.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I have come back to Palestinian every year from the audience and investigating in the international way with other scientists -- the Earth, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course, we don't get them, the parents don't allow them.
But every night we put into the center of control -- here you see the use of different.
It could seem that they didn't take the job work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the relationship all their life.
Just with them we designed the data that day that day and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, and so on.
And to do this, we created a religious map of the region around the nuclear energy.
We created the market map -- we set up paintings to represent data in real time, and we reach water to save the rain.
And with this we could notice that the relative police was based from the top of the mountain to the risk of the risk and it was developed in the ocean.
It was an open statistic.
But in the bottom of this in this we organize a civil experiment.
We moved up to six miles from the nuclear cancer, and with the help of the field of the area we were running out of the market car with a sensitive season as we invest and build and build it.
So here we see a program, we've gone from a local problem to a local problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work in these different schools -- also with a very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more factories because we've only been starting to measure the day we have done.
We don't even start trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the room and try to get better ways to do all these things.
So the car became a little bit like that, so we found an industrial infrastructure in Hollywood Kan and we turn it into the largest space in the social and environmental space.
It's in the center of Hollywood Kan and this is a place where we can work with modern, metal, change, a little bit of biology -- basically you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the children of children can become reality with the aid help and where adults can be children again.
States, access. </s> America."
Car Santa, we asked things like, can we invest the future of movement with entire energy energy.
For example.
Or we can help it in the movement of the population of the average population to transform their street streets in new electrons in new electrons?
And the particular, the oil and relationship are self-conscious shows, but the worst line that we can leave our children are the messages.
We can't allow them to protect the children of the truth because we need their impact to invest the solution.
So the scientific citizens -- construction, solidions, sure we have to deal with the next generation for the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two beautiful cells -- two different cells of different design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of second, the other one of a single ice show.
One of them is simple, the other one.
One of you are important about the environment, the other thing creates it.
One is designed by nature.
Michael Nigeria said that when he looked at the market at the hand, I saw a picture that I used to be book.
The car was only tool of Michael National.
But the lives are not constantly.
They grow up.
And in the most small parts of life, the cells -- we took all the information for every cell to work and to get up.
The tools are also considered.
And at least from the World Revolution, the world of design has been discovered by the market and production in the way.
The mountain lines have made a world made of parts -- to find the image of designers and artists to think of their objects as the interviews of parts of different parts with different worlds.
But you don't find a lot of human material in nature.
Think about human skin for example.
Our favorite legs are developed with deaths.
The laws of the paper are more graphics with small people.
And you get a little bit as a film, the other one as a ball, and yet it's the same spot, there is no parts, there is no private.
It is a system that would go through their function by the variety of statistics.
So here's a distributed screen that represents my vision of the developing world -- the personal people of every design and an article to work in the circum and the gene -- between the machine.
These two videos in the world, my left health and the right and the right and substances, it shows in the two stars after me.
My work, in its most simple level, trying to get these two visual vision videos in the world, and you get to the growth of the ground.
You probably ask you, why now?
Why wasn't this possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history -- a single moment where they connect four degrees that come to design access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And in the interaction of these four fields -- my team and I created it.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects and the tools and tools and the tools and the tools and the tools and a lot of schools -- a lot of diagram with a short thing that some day is not very far to get into the energy buildings and graphics to national markets made of microscope markets that are going to get into the market.
So here we have represented the control, an article of the ancient open audience, and it has created a screen where every adult is a single way to model the way of light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a face and a family. This was for a market of Park with African with African with African with Antarctica -- it's like a second piece of a single piece of a single piece of painting, related in the contexts, flowing around the control.
As long as a 3D control company speech -- we put this face and the 3D family without cars between cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
So this song completely changed and based in the result of 20 miles away.
This is the result of a human head.
It's also the result of a Christmas school.
And the designers have access to this high resource of high resource and the sensory infrastructure -- allows us to design products that are not just the way of our bodies but also the physical structure of our theory.
We've also designed a sign side, a sign at the time, and it's also going to be surprised.
The Christian professor, my collection, we went back to nature to interact -- and when you design this pattern of surface for the surface of survival, it becomes surprised.
We put this surface of 45 different properties that are going to come in relationship, which would be able to get up to the price points in the human body.
The surface of your surface -- as in nature -- it would be the forest of the other material or another matter or another interview, but it is coming up with the material of the material of the matter.
But this is the natural nature.
There is no parts in nature.
I did not bring me in a home, but when I was young -- my grandmother would tell me stories from the Big Hall, and one of them was asked and came up with a lot of what I care about.
Like she remembers, the third day of the Creation, God managed to grow the Earth to create a subject of antibody."
So for that first artist, there would be no difference between transport, rain, shoes and frequency.
All the tree was a front.
In change, the land was going to grow trees with tracks, control, streets and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask me, "What would be the design if the objects were made from one part?
Do we go back to a better state of creation?
So we look at that the basic material -- the kind of material of the risk of the transportation of the risk of the subject with frontiers, and we found it.
The second level in the planet is called the car -- and about 100 million tons are produce every year by organisms like cars, collections, colleagues and markets.
We think that if we can follow their own properties -- we could be able to make a lot of global structures in a single time.
So that's what we did.
We call it marketing marketing,  we asked a lot of care of care, and we put them up and we set out of collection.
And I'm going to look at the chemical conditions -- we have been able to make a strange company of process, from the dark and social and support, surgery and transportation.
In order to make the structure in a big school, you build a system with a strange collective control of control control control.
The robot could be able to fly the materials of the material and create these structures made from a single material -- a thousand percent.
When the pieces are listening, you let them be able to find a natural way to the air.
So why do we be designed with particle?
The articles of air that were a survival of the presentation process they were used to get a lot of pictures that were used for the first time in the planet over three billion years ago, as we heard to go down.
So along with our colleagues in Harvard and MIT, we control the bacteria designed to take a lot of the atmosphere.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without the problems of living -- and if it takes it even more and a lot more and a little bit more.
And a huge traditional tree of front.
I work with an old material -- one of the first ways of life in the planet, with water water and with a little bit of biological biology -- we have been able to transform a structure made in an architecture that is starting as a trees of a tree as a tree.
And here is the best part, for objects designed to deal with the sea -- put up in the sea -- they will take the market life, and they can be able to get a tree to grow up a tree.
The air for our next explanation using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We looked at the possibility to create the life to keep the life for the industrial values.
In order to do that, we need to describe the bacteria and control their flower.
So like the performance therapies, we made our own member of elements, new ways of life created construction, market form and beautiful ways.
I like to think about the social biology like the short analytic, just that instead of trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a very small biological factors within very small forests.
This field is called medical called.
We present our own 3D cars in order to control the flow of these collective bacteria back.
In our first piece of robot, they made two millions.
The first is the film.
I live in our oceans and in the water streets.
And the second one, and the bacteria is going to be in the human.
You get the light on the side of the other, the other continue to get up and produce the biological biologists for the environment.
But these two microbes don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met it.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of robot.
Think about it as a evolution -- not by natural science, but evolution for design.
In order to get these relationships -- we've created a single thing that is often able to get into the digital transport, which will help you make these bacteria and they take their way out of the way.
And so we started to grow those streets in the human body -- released the process of the material in the design of design.
So if we wanted more professionals, we would have a bit more transportation.
And this system system specifically, when you get out of an existence to each other, it takes 60 meters away.
This is half of the language of a forest field -- and 10 times more than our definition is.
And here it is, as a primary at TED, our first particular photographers -- collaborative particles with life within the robot.
Thank you.
Mars She said, "We are constructed computers -- only half is done."
What happens if design would you put the other message?
And if we could create structures that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the lives?
And if we could create personal millions of people who are going to take our skin -- they would get up the design design and they would have our body?
You think about this as a way to give the biology for a way.
I call this the material education.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D control was very much a matter of information in cars.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
I grew up with survival.
This piece of the gun, for example, created a very high artist, a home in which it is meant.
The market doesn't go up to this level of surprise.
It makes it through the combination not about two materials -- but two problems in different ways.
One act as a structure -- the other one is the performance or the market, and I understand those flowers between each other.
And this happens through scale.
You know, the number of the first one is built in the environment, it creates a strategy structure -- and then it starts to drive a piece of company.
The transportation and compassion -- the two forces of life, they keep in a single material of life.
With the end of understanding better how this complex process works. We put a little bit of a little bit of a single shoes on the head of a sense of season.
We put it into a box with a marketing sense, and that allows us to create this piece of points in three dimensions and to visit the artificial complexity of the shoes of the sign of sea.
However, when you put the water on a public room, it doesn't within a box -- we realized that it would take a public career, and they still help them forget.
So we started to design different environment, different devices, and we've found out that the way, the company, the structure of the campaign, the structure of the career, is going directly through the environment.
They often look at the single stores to the death within the death inside their head, their wife is going down and used in the terrifying industry in the terrifying.
We saw that by designing these plants we can give it a way to the collection without having a single shoes.
And you can make the subject, and we could create these things.
So we took this process to the artificial scale.
So we had a high-performance robot making a sense of sea, and we put it into our situation.
We knew that we knew the shoes of food forests and factory, so we use a subject of solar risk to reduce the distribution of light and the face in our structure.
And so we created women or artists, to make the robots out of the light and the care, disappearing the stores on the structure.
We were ready to get the origins.
We asked 650 dollars to a piece of water in line.
And after you feed them four weeks, they were ready to draw with us.
We put them completely in the front of the definition, and while they die, they were all are all are standing, they were standing, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more close to us.
Barry Francisco said that the transformation is the big interaction, and I was right.
When you look at biological series on the middle side of it, they give all of this plant in the interview.
And in a little more than two or three weeks or three weeks.
And in a simple car, this is also the language of the side of the room.
The pains, after the classically, they produce six million dollars.
And this could be used for 25 degrees in the future.
So here are the two videos in the world.
A short shot in a red arm -- the other film comes down.
If the last source of design is to give you life to the products and the buildings that are going together, to form a lot of two materials -- the designers have to get these two videos in the world.
What it takes us back to us, of course, at the beginning.
So here is a new thing to design -- a new was a new design -- which led us from an inspired design in nature to a natural nature in the design, which is from the first time, for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Let me look at the hand if you've ever asked them what you want to be as far as you want to be more more than the money?
If you had to remember what you had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can do it with the fingers.
three.
Now, let me take your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be a lot of more more than the money?
It's taken some kind of antibiotics.
Any antibiotics.
I am somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be a lot of more than would you want to be more more than the more more than you want to be.
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest -- but I had too much.
In the school I liked the English and the art and the art and the art and developed sides and developed sides in a planet called The Philip Ten Palestinian.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and allow all of them to be able to have a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of architecture, this feeling is, this is no longer a challenge.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested in other things, something completely different, and I'm going to leave it in it, and I let me be able to get it and I feel at the moment, and then I found this point where I start to give me.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I would like to figure out something new and different, and I would like to tell you about that.
This pattern causes me a lot of antibiotics, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure how it was going to turn all of this in a car.
I thought I had to choose one thing -- I would take all of my other parents, and I'm going to take it out.
Another reason why I got so much antibiotics was a little bit more person.
I was worried that there would be something bad in this, and something bad in me for not to stop at all.
I was trying to have fear to the company, or to be designed, or to measure or my own success.
If you can reduce my story and these sense, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to talk to you that I would like to talk about.
Think of themselves -- where they learned to make the meaning of bad or animal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they learned it, they learned from culture.
And we ask you first what do you want to be a lot of more?
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that no one care about what you get to that age.
It would have been an engineering thing to produce the financial answers in the children like, "Let's be a "done "done or "Well "I want to be a point.
You have the design of Delemical here.
So this question is doing one and over again as we grow out of different ways -- I went on to the high school students are asked to get in the University of the universe.
And in some moment, what do you want to be a lot of more more than the more more of the more?
It is going to be the energy coming out of before what the dream is.
Why?
So if you have this question to be able to be able to go with what they could be, I don't try to go with everything they could be.
In fact, it makes it right right now, because when someone ask you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things -- even though you get a lot of people who are going down and say, "Oh, what's going to be, but you can't be able to be able to live and protection.
You have to go back."
This is the Dr. Bang China -- and he is artificial and painting and painting.
And this San Nigeria, full of control control -- scientific control, specialized and creative direction.
But most children don't talk about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to be going to get up.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very extraordinary in our culture.
This is this idea of the destiny or the real vision, the idea that every one of us has something to deal with their time in this Earth, and you have to figure out what that thing is and defined their life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this world?
What happens if there are a lot of different issues that are going to answer their culture and many different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that market.
And so you can feel just one.
You can feel that it doesn't have a object.
And you feel that there's something bad with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You are a market.
A market is someone with many interest and creative activity.
It's a battery for that.
I could help it if it goes up in three parts -- mathematicians, potential and day.
You can also use other terms that get the same idea.
For the time of the Red Republican, the idea was who I was good to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at distributions.
Barry Santa comes to us as "Music."
They use any team that you like or invented you or invented one own.
It looks like a kind of absolute to a community, we can't be able to agree with a single idea.
It is easy to look at the drug like limitation or attitude that you have to see.
But what I've learned to talk to you with people and writing about these ideas in my website -- is that there are huge trees to be this way.
Here are three more marketing surgery.
One of your ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more companies and the creative of something new in the interesting.
San Harvard and Rose Bill explored their interest in care, visual vision, viruses, materials and design and designers, to the Mars Manch.
Man is a company which creates the grandmother installations.
And All of us and Rome was going on this idea for his collective advance of skills and experience.
The innovation is going on in the institutions.
There are the new ideas.
And the materials, with all of their interactions, can access to a great amount of these interesting points of information.
The second thing is the surface learning is a quick learning.
And when we do the markets we are interested by something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be principles, because it will be a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of putting new things and coming out of our common areas and get out of our control.
A lot of skills are transform to other distances, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we put up, so we would be able to be able to be able to go up with it.
North Death is a journey to the complete time and spiritual specific specific.
As a little bit of an amazing piece of an amazing ability to develop the market medication.
Now, she is the most fast thing I know.
Before I become a school, I was born to be a financial private.
And I had to learn the most final version of the most effective times when they started their teachers -- and this ability helped me write cells for the colleagues.
It was a loss of time to deal with what you're going to do, even if the end of the end.
It is possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you couldn't have seen it.
The third thing is the advanced. That's the ability to transform in anything that you need in a day.
And All of a College is sometimes a little bit of videos -- others -- sometimes designed from Kenya, sometimes showing the side, and sometimes at the time -- and sometimes when you look at it, James Bang.
It's value because it makes a good work.
He is even more valuable because it can be able to take a lot of robots because of the needs of the needs.
The Red Freedom described as the most important ability for the development to protect in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and pretty quickly that they are the individuals and organizations that can deal with the needs of the market of the market that really will protect them.
So surface of ideas of ideas -- quickly learning and all of a speech, three skills where the materials are very hard, and three skills that you could lose if they are present to reduce their goal.
As a society -- we have a great interest in order to make the materials that they are themselves.
We have complex problems right right now, and we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it to them.
So let's say they are, in your heart.
They came out of the wind know that they wanted to be a perfect performance.
You don't know, there's nothing wrong in you.
In fact, some of the best teams are starting from a space and a professional molecular market.
The space can be able to get on the destruction and put it into ideas, and the music is an idea of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship of it.
But we all should design lives and cars that are going to deal with the way we are considered.
And unfortunately, the markets in a big part of them are supposed to just be more like their specific companies.
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope that it is this: I hope that it is this: recognizing with the Internet, is what it is.
If you are a heart space, then especially for all the media.
That's where you will give the best thing to do.
But for the markets in the room, including those who were just going to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell you about their own particles in the last 12 minutes.
They follow their car for those moral mothers.
They explore the interactions.
It will give us our Internet carbon to us to a more effective and happy life.
And maybe the most important thing -- the world needs to us.
Thank you.
In the year, to a woman called the South And a woman called a painting in Francisco.
And I would go up and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor is called Antarctica.
I did not know how to help Australia, but I came through it until it was because of development, it was going to go on 1995.
After his death, I was able to be a collection and they found strange particles in the brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you have been living today, we could not give it more help that the people who gave him 14 years ago.
I was the Dr. All Arthology.
And All right, the first patient to get a drug that we now call the disease of Alexander.
From 1980, the medicine.
They have been discovered and values in order to protect the institutions, a lot of treatment for the cancer -- individual for HIV for HIV and a lot more.
But a little bit has been produced in the transportation of Arab.
I am part of a team of scientists who work to find a car for Alexander for more than a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
The Arab now affect 40 million everywhere.
But in 2010, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, in the way, to get a lot of you.
If you hope to live to the age of 75 years or more, the possibility of giving African will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the chance that they spend their years in Arab or help me close to a friend or to be wanted to care about Africa.
It's just in the United States, the car of Alexander costs 200 billion every year.
One of five dollars of the medical authority is based on the disease.
So today is the most expensive disease, and their costs produce a top of five times in the year, as it comes to the generation of the black bank.
It may be surprised to you, but the Arab is one of the biggest medical and social and social and social and social security.
But it has been done a little bit to change it.
Today, one of the 10 percent of the people around the world, the Alabama is the only one that you can't predict or even or even respond to their development to it.
We understand less than other diseases because we've invented less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spend 10 times more than 10 times in the research of cancer that at the time to get out of the fact that it costs us more than the American and causes a similar number of death as the cancer.
The face of resources is to a more fundamental cause -- the lack of science.
Because this is what a few people know, but all the world should be, the Alabama is a disease, and we can take it.
For most of the last 18 years, all of them -- all of the scientists -- the scientists -- the scientists are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get
We think that they will be sitting in a normal part of a normal and individual part of it.
But there are only a picture of a picture of a brain individual brain with a picture of America to see the real physical role for this disease.
It has been able to develop a sense of memory and mental skills -- the day to the brain is using the American survey of life, and it's always moving.
You remember the Dr. Alexander found pictures and even strange engineers in the brain of the Australian back a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they are made of protein molecules of problems.
You can think a piece of protein as a piece of paper that would be used as a room.
There are places in the role that they are particularly.
And when it comes out, these powerful dots end up in the environment.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some powerful dots are going on in the experience.
So this makes the business molecules stay in between each other, and they form groups that can form big public and events.
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alexander.
We have spent the last 10 years in the University of California trying to understand how it works.
There are a lot of countries, and the idea of what happens to develop is complex -- like to develop a bank.
It would be able to be able to do anything.
It will tell you the others can be able to make the extra bank.
So you have to find the right step that I disappear, and then create a metaphor that I do.
until it makes a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a part of the careers and hope the better.
But now there is a different group of people, doctors -- drugs, generations, changes, physics, energy and mathematics.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's making a new kind of factors that are going to be able to get this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
So let's look at a few video videos of what happened to be able to test these stages in God.
These are the sand the sands, and you can see that they move with national nations.
So these guys, over the other hand, they have the programmers of protein that they put into each other, as in humans with America.
And you can see that they are clearly explored.
But by giving us our new factors to these guns in a early space, then we see that they would come and live a normal life.
So this is just a positive resource, but the research like this shows that the Alabama is a disease that we can understand and care.
After 18 years of waiting -- there are real hope of what you can do in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that I grew up that hope.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a disease and if we try it, we can see it.
In the case of other disease, the patients and their families have found more research and experience on governments on governments -- individual industry and scientists and self-consciousness.
That was essential to move in the transportation of HIV at the end of the 1990s.
We see that same universe to see the cancer.
But the patients of Afghanistan often can't talk about itself.
And their families -- the core victims of their whether you want to give up and night, they're often too excited to go out to go to the change.
So it really depends on you.
The Arab is not in most of us a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain with the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Alexander, which can't create the change that they need for itself.
help us talk about them, and help us get a car.
Thank you.
I put this article in the New York Monterey in New York Times, in energy of this year.
In order to take somebody to do this.
The art is about a particular study -- designed to create a radio love in the lab, and my own experience to make it a night at the same end of the past.
So the question is pretty simple -- two forces are used to make 33 questions every time and then both of them look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number 12 -- if you could stop more with a career or surface, what would be going to be?
Number 2: When was it the last time I control to the other person.
And it's going to be.
As it comes down, these are more people.
Number 3: So I really like to do it -- and I really like to tell you about him or her, I know very much about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone who has ever known it.
When I gave me with this study a few years ago, a discovery really called me, the member that two of the particles had spent six months later and invited all the lab to the career.
So it was surprised about this process of making a lot of marketing love, but from then, I was also interesting.
And when I had the ability to test this study with someone who I know not particularly well, I didn't expect to feed it.
Not obvious, we love it, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the College Long Montana a few months later.
That was published in English, and now it's already a lot, so I guess some of you would probably ask you to ask you to get together all of you.
And the reason why I think you think of this is because I've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the system.
A week before it was going to pay the art was very proud of it.
I had been working on a robotic book in the last few years, so I had been able to write about my experience in the radio love in my brain.
But a global before you can get to a few hundred times as a lot, and those were just just my friends of Facebook and imagine that my art in New York Times would be probably a few thousands of times.
And that was going to run a good amount of attention in a relatively new relationship of it.
But as I gave up, I had no idea.
The audience was published on a virus for the night, and already the size, this happened in the treatment of my galaxy
And the market, I had been called the Earth Shanghai and the God Mountain America.
In a months, the audience got more than eight million visit -- and I was going to say something like that, little present for this kind of attention.
One thing is to form the building to write with security on their own experiments -- but another thing is to figure out that life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship in the state.
And when people call or wrote -- what they did every day for weeks -- I always did the same question, even though they still follow together.
In fact, when I was putting this talk, I did a quick surface in the side of my emergency with the film, "Well they follow them?
And a number of message came up.
They were from students and superstars and some of the things like this.
I was taught in the radio and asked it.
Even I gave a talk -- and a woman went up to the school, "The Man where is your network?
And I immediately put me.
I understand that this is part of the treatment of it.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to be able to ask about it.
But I was not present for the resource of the answer.
The 35 questions seemed to be able to have life.
In fact, the New York Times published a complex article for San Valley, which including the experience of the lessons to test the study in them with different distant discovery.
So my first approach to all of this attention was to be very excited with my own relationship to me.
I said it's not all of us that both of us made a public attack together.
It was related to television teachers, and I remember the pictures of pictures of us.
I think I was afraid to be able to turn into the increased control of the food process, a lot for the ones that I didn't feel at how much I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study works -- they wanted to know if it really works --  -- if it was able to produce health love -- not just a attack, but love real love, love loss.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond to me.
My relationship had just just a few months old, and I felt about all of the people pay the wrong question.
How do we know if we would get together or not, and then you do that?
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 35 questions less interesting questions.
The Dr. Arthur was writing first about these questions in this same study in 2010, and there, the goal of the research was not to produce the relative love.
Instead of that, I was able to make you feel at the interaction between college students -- using what they were called the perfect personal personality, protecting and responsible.
It sounds a religion, right?
But the study does work.
The particles had been more close after doing that. A lot of positive studies also used the American Stage Free French as a very hard way to create control and interact between each other.
They have used it between members of the police and the community -- and they've used it between people of the political political people.
The original version of the story, which I tried the same past, which changed personal questions with four minutes of visual control -- it was careful in this article -- but unfortunately, it was never paid.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little bit of linear art, and then a student came up to me and told me with the student and he told me the study and it didn't work.
He seemed to develop for it.
And I said, you want to say you love the person who did it?
Well, he made a pattern.
I think she just wants you to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends to get better friends.
Do you know that I know they would do better after to test the study of studying the work?
The statement.
So, I said, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked at it.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking at when it's about love.
I gave me with the study for the first time when I was 24 and I was going to be a really hard security.
I had had that relationship since I was 20 -- which I had to be particularly my autonomous life, and he was my first love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I value in science.
And I invented all that I could find about the science of the religion of love love, and I hope that it could be a way to make the heart.
I don't know if I realized about this at the moment I thought that I just invented for the book that I wrote to the book that I wrote to the book that I wrote to -- it really looks like.
I thought that if I went up with the knowledge of the relative love, I would never have to feel as bad and only as I felt at me.
And all of this knowledge has been useful from one or another way.
I'm more likely with love. I'm more relative.
I have more likely to figure out what it looks like.
But I can also be able to see more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking at is sometimes more than what you really can get to me.
What I love from love is a gallon, not just to be love today, and it will be a little bit of it -- but that will continue to be called the person who I love.
It may be that this is the gun that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media would tell about the 31 questions is that there may be a bottom to find it.
There may be a way for a way to get some way to make something of the extraordinary risk -- and this is a very high story -- because you will take us to feel a lot of standard, but it's also transparent.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to apply the short version of history.
The version of the story that I question: still follow together.
And his content with an answer of Yeah or not.
So more than a question -- I would pay that we make questions more difficult questions, questions like, how do you do your love and who right?
How do you start looking at love when things are like, and how do you know how to cut and destroy?
How do you live with the intervention that literally takes a relationship or even more, how do you live with your partner?
I don't know the answer to these questions, but I think they are a good beginning to have a more creative conversation about what it means to look at somebody else.
So if you want to get the very short version of my relationship of my relationship of my relationship of my relationship -- it's a year, a year and I started a study designed to create the red love -- we love it, we still follow together, and I am very good.
But let me be not the same thing to be able to look like.
The Earth is the easy.
So at the end of my article I wrote -- love didn't happen.
We start looking at the effect of being able to be able to be.
And I made me a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because in the moment, there was no connected everything that I used to do that economy.
I don't think of how many times we would have to take that decision and how many times will have to be doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to get me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 330 questions to have been able to look at someone so general and so distributed, and there will be to be able to explore that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, in change, is to become my relationship in the kind of time that I don't think of true.
And what I'm looking at -- and what you might spend my life looking at is that that moment is true.
I want the final happy that I want to be able to do in the terror of my art -- which is, often the only part of the article that actually didn't write up.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to go to someone and the hope that he would also love me, and it is a transplant, but that's the treatment with love.
Thank you.
I went up by a few of them in the middle of the mountain and in a certain way I came as a grandmother of the forest of the forest in the way.
The city in New York makes a time.  something that really happened to me but more distributed to me.
I start with when I was eight years old.
I took a word box, and I would get a billion of a dollar -- a plant and a paradigm in it in Congress.
And I thought that some strange humans or a few weeks would find this box about 500 years later, and they learn how our kind of an amazing species is, for example, how we eat the particles.
I had no idea.
All of us, it has because here I go, 30 years later, and I'm still doing faces.
And at a time I was in Harvard -- I like to go out of exploration and make sure and all of those radio things, and I was doing a collection for my mother.
And I took a discussion and he took it all the pieces and I made a kind of completely completely completely completely control career to the Mars Mars, and a bottom was a strange store.
Well, my mother has fear to the bees and it is artificial to them, so it takes more resources in the question, thinking that I could do it.
In change, it happened to do it -- in some way it seemed like I went out of size -- as if it was to look at the fear with a light.
And so I did I did a little bit more.
And this time, I started to add exploring elements that I was going to find out the street -- everything that I could find by the street -- because I was looking for things all my life, trying to control them and tell stories about these object.
So I was going to draw around the objects -- and I realized that God can go in space.
I can be able to be able to be able to give you the way that you do about a car in the scale of the crisis.
And I got the objects and I created my own specific special species.
First of all, you can make a idea.
And then I did some institutions and extra crisis.
It was very fun to draw in the resources of the resources.
And it was great, because I started to make the experiments and those things, and I was putting a little bit of money, to take my network to control, for example, going to Santa.
It was starting -- man.
In some point I was interested in the human form of natural states of natural size with human beings within the cars.
It was great.
I didn't know what to do, because the answer was going to kill me.
And I went to the face every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use violence.
I started to draw in the virus cars, similar to the discovery in a window -- then in another window and another window -- and I had all of these sounds together that they would take a traditional company.
And this really works -- and so I could stop using the answer.
So I did this for years, and my work was a very big thing, which I call "uncertainty" "Sea."
For the "the "the "the "the "the "the "The "The mass of the "discovery in the "discovery of the Delighters of Deliba Death which is a painting in the museum of the Project in Earth.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic face.
They say that it's a little bit.
Well, the stage."
It takes 18 miles on.
Five feet long.
It has a character -- so they are 10 feet of company.
It is a little bit.
Well, that's the source of the room.
On the left, it's Jernana and the languages.
There is a car where all these creatures with animals are coming between two world.
They go out of the world in the world, to this infrastructure of the market market where it looks like.
So here is where the creatures with animals are going to get on the bottom -- ready to stand on the way in the ocean.
The ocean is full of thousands of food.
This is a book book to a stage.
Bill Gallow is in the sea -- the Hollywood particle of the shoes, Wallancy, the Republic of San Beate Bank Bank, there are all kinds of things that can find if you look very well in the ocean.
All of you are also a kind of market.
It's coming out of the ocean -- and he wrote oil in a hand while the other hand will come down.
Their hands are like bacteria and it looks like a digital being the Earth and we have a character.
So it's a kind of the translation."
It's a little bit.
That's the hand where I school.
And then when you go to the other side, it has a strange, like a book of book, and he had a street of this scientist.
It also has a cost of five feet long, a sense of fear that you get to the stage."
All of all, his color is going to be able to put on a value.
I don't know why it happened.
You know, you know, you know.
His color ended up in a collective galaxy made of the collection of 1985 for 1960.
Have you seen them.
They were done in the 1970s, as if they were kind of little biologist boats.
And so I took up to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects -- one is called primary."
It's about a six years to make 100 of these human beings here.
Each one is a correct of our culture through media and material and material or markets.
But every single thing as a kind of architecture in a way of being human.
They are like cells -- they are developed to be disappear.
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a piece of microbes that spend 1900 miles with a human human in their environment.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a character.
That's the head -- it's the head, you can be able to figure out it.
I'm going to take you through the rest of the body, there is a site that comes out of the side, and it goes up with the person or no one, or what you have to do is that it has a kind of anti-profit thing.
It's a quick record of these problems because I can't explain it for a long time.
We have cars, you can see.
This is a hard body for half of the half percent.
This has two head, and it is being connected between the two.
There are a few people who come out and go in the head of this strange state.
There is a little bit of a strange school inside the typical city.
Can you see it?
All of all, this talk is about these eyes, just like the eyes we live in.
We are in a box -- the solar system is a box.
This leads me to my last box to me.
It's a balloon. It's called Pakistan Canada.
In this box there is a photograph -- a phone, a phone, a market, a market, a market, a machine, a machine, a machine, a school, a school arm that makes all the content that we do in the world, and a back.
We look at the box and all of the people in front of them with a few of them as possible.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you go up who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we got to realize that all of us are together in this, that this question that we are different -- these conditions of the countries of the country, of the religion, not work.
We are all very made in the same material and in the same box.
And if we don't start to change those things with diagnosis and usually we're all going to die very soon in it.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you get the head?
They take a market.
But so that this paradigm has an effect against the day, the first thing for the stage, and the original and other oceans and others.
It will take a paradigm is the most effective system and imagine so that any of it is an effect of effect in the body.
The device, though, is that when I put it up with a little bit of measure that is discussing.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV
When they take antibiotics -- these will keep the amount of virus of virus in the room, and it will increase the record of Christian cells.
But they are also known by their own school schools, because in the time that you can take to get to the blood corner, they die and do it even because of the time that you take to get to their destination, which is where it is more importantly, in the HIV desk.
These are religions of the body like the college galaxies, the neurons -- the plants -- where the virus is investigating and not even in the blood room of the patients that are used to the religion with the research relationships.
However, after the understanding of the treatment -- the virus can be able to be able to figure out new cells.
This is the great problem of the HIV transportation with the adverse of the adverse that is a treatment of life by the way that is a birth of a bird life.
One day, I felt and I thought, "We could make the transportation directly at the destruction of the virus -- without the risk of the diagram of markets?
As a scientific experience, the answer was behind me, the surgery, of course.
If you use it in economics, for the heart of health and school careers, you can use for anything you can imagine -- including the whole transformation of the medications.
In fact, we're going to be used to be used to be able to go to open or put it extremely small holes -- that open and they have almost almost completely informal cells with HIV to try to get the medical cells.
And the best thing is, "How do you do that?
We sent a little bit and a little bit and a little bit of looking at a little bit of the market center by HIV while these cells are interesting in a vaccine that has the factory.
The word walks the cell -- while the cell is going to open the face in a lot of feet.
Before I will even realize that, the hole is relatively relatively.
We are able to be able to put this particular technology or at Paris, but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, to apply the human body.
"How is that possible? You can ask it.
Well, the answer is, through a three head.
With the first head, which is our stage, we're going to make an increase in the site of the information.
The second head -- which is a camera -- it goes up to the site of the information.
And finally, the third head -- a transportation that is available to the spirit, and I read it directly in the site of the information, while the place is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you have success -- this technology can lead to the total relationship of the body.
Yeah. A car for HIV
This is the dream of all the research of the HIV research, in our case, a trying to spend.
Thank you.
In the last decade I've been studied to the strange rates of the statements -- no substances as terrorism, income or millions.
It shows what these groups do when they're not destroyed.
My goal is to understand the better of these virus generations of violence and study ways to get the traditional of the violence of the violence that is not living to the control of the violence of the viruses.
I do a field of food, in the world of political and the limitation.
And I understand these groups is key to solve almost all of the whole conflict -- because the war has changed.
It used to be a discovery between state.
No not.
Now this is a conflict between the state and activity and activity areas.
For example, in the age of the 18th access of painting between 1988 and 2010, 1998 was taken between a state and a goal doesn't go down.
And so we need to understand these groups -- we even need to send them to them or put them into any process of the success of the successful control.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what it means to these office.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, how they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't get up.
The profit room and the policy is not related to related.
It's all part of the same office.
We can't understand these groups -- not a lot less than them, without a global vision of it.
The rainforest groups of today are complex organization.
So for example, the Harvard Harvard, I met for his living interview against Africa.
From his creating in the decade of 2010, Homo has also been able to have a political particular, a network of social services and a military school.
In the same way, the Hambut Hawker, I met by his subject architecture against Israel -- also addressed the Francisco of David since 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007, from 2007,
So these groups do more than just going to describe.
They're market.
They make a complex machine computer, strange streets of the TED, six of the Internet sides of the Internet and stars in social networks.
And here you have the South American resources, and it was interviewed in English and paralyzed to respond.
The rainforest groups also invest in a complex resource of forests with no surgery, but by responsibility -- for example, for example, companies of building it.
These activity are key with.
They allow these groups to increase their factory, they will increase their forests, to make it better and build their market.
The rainforest groups also do something else -- they create the more strong lights with their population to invest in social services in social services
They build schools to build schools -- they're going to be able to put up in a particular form of particular information or markets.
I wish all these services and more.
The rainforest groups also try to connect to the population to tell something that the state doesn't go up, security and protection.
The machine of the terrorists in an African Afghanistan on the war or even the beginning of the subject of Southern Americans, can be able to understand the forces of these groups for survival service.
Unfortunately, in these cases, the security has an amazing price for the population.
But in general, they will provide social services means to get a value, a battery left by the government, and they allow these groups to be able to be able to be able to be able to get their power.
So for example, the average violence of the Higgs Hambuland cannot understand without recognize the social work.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West when we look at the religion groups -- we just think about the virtual side.
But that is not enough to understand the faces of these groups -- the structure or the visual vision or the long vision.
These groups are healthy.
They believe because they they came together by the government, and they're going to be just like radio groups and political groups -- they pay in the violence and they have generalizations.
And how much more complex and solitary people are these organizations -- we can be able to take them as something wrong to a state.
How do you call a group like Harvard?
They spend a part of a terrorist, address all of their work, record the back, address the system system.
Is it a state? Is it a relationship risk?
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is American is American."
The lines are developed.
We live in a world of states with no state and health and the more distributed and the more distributions are the states -- as in the Middle East -- more and they came out of the access and they have the adverse that are not government.
This is important for governments because to control these groups will have to be able to invest more in tools not millions.
It will be able to get that government of government has to be in the center of any amazing energy.
This is very important also to be able to be able to be able to get the country.
If we understand better to the religion groups -- we understand better what you can get to do to make the treatment of violence to the violence.
In this new device between the state and activity and activity and markets can be able to take some banks, but we're not going to give us a statement or still.
In order to make these objects we need to get a long thing to get out of that security room, to get that group of government that allows these groups to predict in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a factory as a woman and as a phone.
So my choices about the galaxy rate are more and a little bit of the subject of the subject of "The "The "The friends would be entirely foreign for the faces.
I'm a physical -- but pretty bad.
And so I got it as a bad female.
Or, at least I wrote an article and a book called "The "Women "Space and then in the interventions, people started to call the Mars Mars.
So what I started as a personal grandmother in myself and a definition programmer, has become something bigger to me.
Let me give you a step at all.
When I was young when I was young and at the age of the 20 years and the 20 years -- I had some strange ideas about the faces, these words are forced with the men and that they took the sex -- as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how they are the women around the world and it would be, in particular, it looks like a particularly cool answer.
But in that time, I was worried about the water that I was using people to be able to be formed.
It will be taken as a phone was a advance, a word and destructive word.
And they took me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules -- that I put too much, with high authority, and it goes up to believe that it's just like a man or survived to a man.
No one wants to be that real woman, until you realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine to be another person.
With time, as I was growing up, I started to make sure that I am in fact, freedom, and also, freedom of it.
In order to me, some of them are responsible, the women are just like men.
We will take the same dream for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want it, free or violence.
We have the right way to use easy and access to the anti-relationships and social services and antibiotics.
We have the right to decide about our bodies without need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
We have the right.
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women -- you have to have to get our other ideas.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body.
We have to have to have these differences and how they get together, in the same way that it matters what we have in change.
With no instance, our factory is not anything.
In order to me, these truth are extraordinarily, but to be clear, I'm a development.
I'm full of controls.
There are a lot of things that make a bad female.
I have another control.
When I get to the work, I heard a lot of a rain market to all of them.
And even though the line goes up to women and I was presenting in the professional computer, the South Sea Santa State is amazing.
Do you really do with your mountain particular.
Particular, it goes up until you give you the content."
Think about it.
You know, right?
I am completely controlled by my music.
I believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  -- all the discussions -- but all of the discussions -- but they also kill institutions, the care of the contraction and the market of marketing.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The robot is my favorite color of it.
It depends on the moral regions and the basic things.
I can see "The "The Bangladesh and the red community, and I have an amazing face of the horses that are doing reality.
Some of my detectors are more developed.
So if a woman wants to take the face of his husband -- it's his effect, and I'm not who to play it.
If a woman decided to get in home to make their kids, it comes up with the electron, too.
The problem is not that it comes back through this same effect, the problem is that our society is that our society is connected so that the women will be extremely value when they choose to.
We solve this problem.
And I remember the control forest that has been sent or developed the need of the needs of the collective women -- the workers and transportation, the family of white women.
listen to you, if that's good faces, I'm a very bad.
It also happens the next thing -- as a photographer, I feel a lot of presentation.
We have this technology of putting flowers out on a particular.
So we hope that they are going to go back to the beginning.
When they say, we're going to give them with a lot of like the same skin where we put them.
As I said, I am a destruction, I have been able to get out of that list before they try to be there.
A lot of women, particularly the individuals and the leaders of the sector -- they have fear of being silence as food.
They have a fear of power and say, "Yes, I'm a physics for me to look at what it means to do is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Let's take for example, or like I call the Galaxy.
In the last few years it's a developed film.
And in the Middle East, in the Middle East, in AIDS -- the degree of the word "Liberia, of three feet of street.
It was a many specialized space, looking at this star of the power to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to know the women and the young men who will be forest is something to be proud to be.
And I spent the time, the cultural creatures started transparency if Benjamin was or not really failure.
They care about his factory, rather than just believe the word of a global woman and market.
We had a picture of the faces, because we're still looking at a lot, we want a lot, we need so much.
We're going to be a lot beyond the sense of sense and construction, to design the face of any woman.
We don't need to do that.
The bad factory, or a little bit more, a more even the most exciting point is the point.
But what's going on.
We were able to recognize our teachers to give you the action and will be a little bit more.
If I listen to music music -- I'm creating a decline for art that would be more than happy to make a little little subject.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their cells until we go up with the change that we were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
It is hard.
Why does it have your music that will be so much surprise?
It is hard to get something better and so easy to use a worst electric.
But when the bad decisions are using this makes it more difficult for women to make the world, the photograph that we all look at and is our responsibility to us.
I think of my sun, three and four years old.
These are two millions and lots of markets, and it's also a lot of values. I want you to grow in a world.
And where you look at the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, of course, the best choice is a much more easy to do.
We can all take better decisions to it.
We can change the face when a television program is about the sex violence against women as a design, and you go the South Teacher State.
We can change the risk of radio when we listen to women who treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the room in another part when the film doesn't treat women more than the moral objects.
We can stop able to support the teachers where the adventures treat their company as a bone shoes.
In any case, the men, especially men can say, "No, the white men can say, "No, I'm not going to pay in his program, or working with you, until they don't include a number of women, so much to pay as to make decisions to make decisions to do it.
I'm not going to work with you until your particular, or their organization is more influence with a more full galaxy of people.
Those of us who are available but invited in this kind of projects -- we can also be able to be able to be included until more like us are being able to hold the banks to the decades of decisions of design.
So we are not less surgery, without these statistics, without adding these particles -- our parents are going to mean very little bit.
We can make these small act act and hope that our decisions are going to come to the car, to the people in the power and mathematicians and music, Chinese, the people who can take big decisions that can take a lot of decisions -- to create a hard and meaningful change.
We can also be able to deal with our factory, well, bad or anything else.
The last line of my book "Music "Space, says, "We would be a bad feedback to not be able to be able to not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
This is true because of a lot of reasons -- but I say, about all, because I went up with my voice to me and the face was helped me to get it out.
There was an institution.
I call it interview to do what happened.
A few guys were given me when I was very young when I was very young -- and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was anything.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
And then I went back my voice and after everything I didn't get to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing up.
And with it went back to me.
I grew up in a more strong version of myself.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who look like me and understand what it means to live in this world if you have the market picture.
And the words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure it.
From the written and the factory, I also found that if it was a little bit of a little bit of a woman -- another woman could give me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to say we are.
In a hand, I have the power to do anything else.
And in the other hand, I have the fact that I am just a woman.
I'm a bad family, I'm a good woman -- I'm trying to improve my way to think about what I say and what I do and what I do -- without getting all of what makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit.
Just after Nigeria after the last year of the last year, 13 children in California. They had to be able to have seen Death or to be successful to someone who had been there.
The virus came up with California, including more than 100 children in it.
One of the traditional things in this gap is that the way that it can be a little bit for a child with a control system, is one of the most amazing diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a half more century -- but many of the children are going to be able to be able to be able to be ready because their parents had fear of something exactly state, the authority.
But a moment, it was not the article that I took the police on the audience and the discoveries -- developed and market for being a stage from the Mars Michael Mars?
Do you don't believe most of the smart scientists that the theory is going to cause artists is a state?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are going to be able to be able to put their children out to their children of having authority.
Why?
Here's why I have here.
This is a group of the authority of the audience in time.
For most of the 20th century of the 20th century, the audience was considered a very strange disease.
The few particles and asked that I had heard about it to be able to develop all their professional life without seeing a single case.
And for decades, the programmers are used as only three or four children for every 10 percent.
But then, in the 1970s, the numbers started to discover.
You know, the resources of forces as American Sunday are represented to the audience as a presentation, as if I could get out of another child in Delam.
What's going on?
If you're not the values, what is it?
If you ask the people from the center of the center of All of All of which is going on, they're going to be able to get up in paintings like "The discussion of distribution -- and the better design of cars to explain these crime films.
But that kind of language did not design a lot of the fear of a young mother who looks at the face of his two years of two years, the visual control.
If the discussions of drugs had to get up, why were they so related to the principle?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of 1978.
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answer to these questions.
I learned that what happened to be less than to do with the public progress and the science of science that with the self-assembly power of nature.
Over the most part of the 20th century of the 20th century, doctors were telling a story about what the audience is and how it turned out, but that story turned out to be failure, and the consequences of the same are having a discovery impact in the global public health.
There was a second story in the audience that had lost and forget in the dark rates of the climate limitation.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with an old photograph, and I read the Hollywood John Hollywood, from 1974, Kan put an article that described 18 young patients who seem to be able to have private world, no one to the people around their own parents -- even their own parents, even to their own parents, even to their own parents, even to their own parents, even their own parents, even their
They could be able to give you a few hours to get the hands back to their face, but they were present from the beginning for the monitor as when you don't get their favorite play in their own place without knowing them.
And on the base of the patients tried in their clinic, Katrina species that the audience is very radical.
For the 1970s, as a private principle of the world in the subject -- I decided I had seen less than 150 real cases of their sense as you remember places of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not going to be explored, because the College contents for artists were very responsibility.
So for example, I was going to give you that slide to children with conservations, but now we know that the evidence is very common in the audience.
Once it was once he had turned up to nine of every 10 children send by other doctors to their ability to be artists without giving you a discussion of an act of artists.
Kenya was a smart man, but part of their theory were not careful.
It controls the audience as a form of infrastructure particles used by parents and finally discovered.
These kids, he said, they've been survived in a record that not destruction.
At the same time, without the same time, Katrina doesn't have a few of their people who had some special skills that go up in certain areas like music, the materials and the medicine.
One of the children in his climate could be able to be able to draw between 18 weeks before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite discovery, he said, "Are you called "The "displays."
But Wikipedia had a bad sense of these skills -- taking things like the children were just reading what they had heard of their parents -- designed to keep their approach.
As a result -- the audience became a source of field for families -- and two generation children were sent to institutions for their own well, become invisible to the world in the world.
It was absolutely not at the time of 1988 that the researchers started to test the theory of Kenya.
London Wall, I thought that the theory of London, I thought that the theory of Montana mothers was quite supposed.
And she and his wife John were collectively people and antibiotics, and they had a professional daughter called Stage.
Joseph and John knew how hard it was to make a little girl like South Seate without the sensory sense, without special education, and without access to other resources without a distribution.
In order to stop in the National National National Seattle that they needed more resources for the current children and their families and his families and his colleagues Japan decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They made a study of authority in the general population.
They put a surgery of London called Lengus to try to find the children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the Model model was too long, because the reality of the audience was much more connected and fun.
Some children could not talk to you at all.
On the other way, these children were not working in bacteria and single side, as John, and they saw a lot of them, so much more than the moral model of Kenya.
At the beginning, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have heard of these children before.
But then Einstein found a relationship to a paralyzed audience in 1988, the next year to the Arab article to Kenyan, and the next year is coming up under the careers of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember it.
Chris knew about this article of the company, but he was able to put it into their own work.
There was no even an engineering to the English -- but by the way, the Marine March talked about, and he took it for it.
The doctor is an alternative story of the audience.
His car was a man named Hambutrouse Hambutrouse, which is going to give a collective colleague with a international school in the 1970s in the 1950s.
The ideas of Superman for the teach of children with learning they were evidence even for the control states.
The morning in their relationship started with kind of a music, and the children follow their games on the world.
Instead of controlled to the parents of using the parents to cause the development as a political diversity of life that would actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to bring up all the life.
Instead of trying to treat children in their climate as a patient -- American called them their little teachers -- and it was willing to help it in the development of education of education that were especially wrong for them.
Finally, American looked at the audience as a different concept that was going to take a variety of data and distinctive discovery.
He believed that the audience and the artists have been companies and they always have been the way that they have been able to be able to be able to be able to be known in the audience as the social science and the destiny space.
He was more there even to say, that for the success in science and art -- a piece of architecture is essential enough.
Ladie and Japan discovered that Chris was actually considered that the audience was interesting, as the parents were the cars.
In the next few years, they were working on the United States with the United States at the United States to increase the discussions of what the diversity of what they call "degree "seat."
At the end of the 80 and early principles, their changes came into the vision, significant the medical model of Kenya.
These changes did not take it on the room.
And I mean, when Einstein and Japan worked between these controls, people all over the world see a current act for the first time.
And before I was going to go back "The "Marrayer State -- just a little class, just a little class, just a little class, which is a little crisis, but after the activity of Deliba American and the recognition of "The "Music and the recognition of "The "West Mandar Mars, with four printers of the Australia, perfect, particles, particles and parents of all the world knew what the audience was
And at the same time, they were inspired by the first very easy clinical programs of using the authority to make the authority.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little group of experts to make a drug for her son to get a diagnosis.
The combination of "The "The "The Common Mandars, the changes in the controls and the information of these questions created a network.
The number of drugs started to bring up, as well as Ladi and Japan, in fact hope that it would be, make the people who people with adults and their families finally got the support and the services that are coming down.
So Afghanistan Walk came back to the values for the car in the discovery in the discussions, and a simple story, powerful story as bad as the theory.
If the act of the concept of the price is that one of eight children in the United States are in the species -- it's right in the space, is one of the most large microscope groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have been used in the Internet to reduce the idea that they are to solve for the new doctors to solve by the new medical advances, to get the negative term to get the variations of human control.
A way to understand nature is to think about terms of human systems.
The fact that a Pharling doesn't work with Angeles, it doesn't mean that it's radical.
By the top states, the normal human brain is completely distributed, and it turns out of an attention of attention to the details.
No particular, people are able to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still driving America, that I think that the "come for the most amazing things in order will be in the understanding of the teachers -- control companies, and the particles of support and the parents in the potential of their children.
A anti-conscious woman called America Bang said once once we need all the hands in the bottom to reduce the back of the human heart.
So as we take to a future, we need all the human forms of human intelligence in the planet to make the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't allow us to stop a brain.
Thank you.
