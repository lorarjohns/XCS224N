You know that what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm the author for children, the more reading in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can wear as a farmer or a leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you today about circles.
And you know that an organization is usually something that came out somewhere.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as an operator.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Boltzmann.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My Circle started in the 1980's, in the middle school, in Stephen, Ohio.
So they hit to bleeding every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to get into the bathroom of the teacher's room.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a love -- and in the 1980's, I felt the need to start working on organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I got a phone call from that teacher, the Post Post who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disillusioned that we never get to know.
You could come to Ohio and please bring that guy you know you've found.
And I must tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to join this please."
Well, the next day we were at Cleveland.
We went to see ourselves, we laughed, and we realized that she needed to be hospitalizing.
We found a place, and we interviewed, and we took it, and we took care of her family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to meet me as an adult came to me and became a box of cells and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed up, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was present in itself.
The Epinect is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy to talk about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything's interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first sheets.
I was amazed.
My heart pounding, I was struggling, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The tops around me of the water nearly 60 meters, and I couldn't even think it was a copy of snow over another nine year after the year.
The bottles are born when they get away from glaciers or break the ice booms apart.
Each top has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and they cling up to the end, whereas others can't support them more, and they collapse into a dramatic passion, a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, by looking at a top, that are isolated and alone, in large as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a top melts, I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As a light bulb releases rich water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I hasten to photograph these tops as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that at these unique moments exist in that way and not going to exist that way again.
It's not the death when they melt. It's not an end, but a continuum of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the tops that photography is very young: it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a shower that I photographed in Kenkath, Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get a rolling rotation.
Here they are.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the top and your flower line.
You can see here, it starts to roll, the ship has moved down the other side and the man is standing there on foot.
This is a bank of Greenland.
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so on, the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one by combining a baby.
So two couples each.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And in this scenario, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joined the X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
They both press and start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity I turn out two roles.
In one of my role, I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a training of training, and what I study in this case is the way people have appreciated the anatomy -- that is to say, of humans and animals, how they've considered the body fluids and animals, how they've considered the body fluids.
The other role that I play in my work is the activist, as a defense of patients, or, as I say sometimes, defining impression of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with silver twins, two people within one body.
I've worked with people with people, much lower than average.
And I've worked with many instances of people with anti-participants -- individuals whose physical types don't fit in the male and conventional feminists.
In general, we can call it interpretation.
The interpretation is adopting many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of having a sex that is not scaling in male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual based on cycle of X whose gene SRN from the chromosome and tells the protections, that we all have in the fatal life, that become testicles.
And then, in the fatal life, the testes produce testosterone.
But since this individual lacks of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same one.
It's the loudness of anxiety to angiogenesis.
So there are high levels of testosterone.
As a result, the body is developed by following a typical common cost.
When you're born, the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl, it's raised as a child.
And often it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the silk, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests realize that instead of having open and a uterus, it actually has testosterone and a chromosome.
What's important to understanding is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called superstring glands.
They're in the back part of the body.
Superstring glands produce anger, the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a typical woman, don't know their chromosome structure, I think it will be a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the angerts.
We produce anger and respond to the angers.
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the anger than the woman who was born with testosteroids that has the anxiety of anxiety to the angertors.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the interports are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a way, they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as a variety. He had a kid, and sexual relationships with her would take a life as a boy and just discovered that he had open and stranger.
It had an extreme way of a disease known as a superstring hypochondriac.
He had 20th child and in the suit of superstring glands were so active that essentially created a hormone hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were male-conceptually -- their brain was exposed to the hormone hormone component.
I was born with a child, no one suspected anything.
And it was at 19 years old when it started to have medical problems caused by the internal message, when the doctors found that in fact, it was women inside of it.
Well, another quick example of a case of interpretation.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as opposited as opposite, which is to say, they have an organic tissue wrapped in the standardized tissue.
We don't know well why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
And the reason that kids with these kinds of bodies -- they are lean, small twins, or interpretatives -- they are supported to normal surgeries not to be able to make a better physical fitness.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you get to several surgeries is that they are a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having female identity, supposedly, being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when we present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with catastrophic.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture vis-a-vis culture.
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic individual.
Imagine how surprising it is to have kids who are born as two people inside a very body.
The smallest case is last year with South African corridor, Cape Sembert, put into the seat of trial in the international games of Berlin.
Many journalist calls to ask me, "What are they going to do to determine whether Cassini Sembert is men or women?"
And I had to explain to journalists that don't exist.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't take a low-cost line between men and women and internal men and women and internal and internal women and internal and internal and internal women.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science advances, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable adaptive categories that correspond directly with stable identical categories -- are much more different than we think.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology allowed.
As we see, we get into a scary terrain.
Let's see, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we going to make away from them in just a few nucleus?
And as we progress in science, we get deeper and deeper in an uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we're driving are probably too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to take a moment from which a body becomes human, and it has different rights to the cats.
There are very heated arguments today -- perhaps not in public audience, but I know within medicine -- about when someone considered a dead person.
Our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still didn't bury it.
If she stopped moving out of it.
But today, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to face the dilemma of really determining someone's death, and that puts us into a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories could make someone like me.
In politics, I'm a program, defending people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it brings me nervous.
I'm going to notice that these categories are much more unstable.
The tension of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent administrator of the Founding parents.
I know they were racist -- I know they were serious, but they were large.
I mean, they were so brave and audacity and so radical in what they did, that I find every single lot of seeing that music car 1876, and not for music, which is totally passionate.
This is what happened in 1776 with the Founding parents.
Founding fathers were, for me, the first activist activists and explains why.
What they were rejected was an analog concept and replaced it with another one who was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as they all remember, what our founding fathers did was the idea of monarchy, the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the atmosphere.
The old world monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood concept.
They were from the idea that the political power was getting to the political power for the right blood rights of grandfather to father and then to the son, etc.
Founding fathers rejected that idea and replaced by a new analog concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They leveled the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not anatomical differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And in part, they were doing it because they were part of an illusion system that they were spending two things.
And he was managing democracy and at the same time the science was born.
And there's very clear if we look at the story of the Founding parents, that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a natural world.
They were taking away from the supernatural explanations and so they rejected the concept of supernatural power that was transmitted by a gay idea of race of birth.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if we look, for example, the Declaration of Independence -- talk about nature and the god of nature.
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in fact, they were becoming the idea of anatomical coincidence.
And by doing that, they were feeling the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened?
And women were training.
Then he came to the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from Southern Truster, who said, "I'm not a woman?"
We found men at the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color that would eject the anatomic awareness about the anatomic difference and again, they screwed.
We see the same with the Disability Movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the coincidence we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain gods.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomical divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean we should give us to the anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five year-old kids should be allowed to have sex relationships or married.
There are some anatomic divisions that for me to make sense and I think we should.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings called the beginning of this talk.
We have two states, both concepted in the middle of 1979, exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
Henry, the opposite was born in term, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed all three months before Henry -- the right to the sexual consent, the right to the vote -- the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other ones in relationship to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered to be considered -- though I haven't told you, if it's a X-ray -- in virtue of being considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered by the mandatory of the mandatory adventure that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary.
Henry can be married in all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So they still pursue the anatomical categories that are in many aspects are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science advanced so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be broken?
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is wasted.
Where are we going?
It looks like what happens in our culture is sort of a pragmatic attitude: "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man there is no chromosome to have chromosomes and to marry a woman we have to have chromosomes Y.
Now, in practice they don't do chemical tests to people.
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you at the beginning of the anxiety of insignificance to the angers.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speeches "I have declared a solution.
It says that we should judge people based on the color of their skin, but in the contents of their cartography" -- going beyond the anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of your cart?
I want to point out I am also sure that I am not sure that we should be based on this to ensure people rights, because I've managed to admit that I know from some people who are likely to deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some speakers I know can make more informed decisions, intelligent and mature relationships about their sexual relationships than people from 40 to 40 to me.
So how do you put on top of the content content?
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with a magnetic MRI.
Do we want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still really important that the United States continues to guide this stream of thinking about relationship to democracy.
We've made a good job in defense of democracy and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless it's willing to commit to a change, in which case it allows to live.
We're not in that situation.
I am glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made it to light twin twins and then separate them and grow their family.
But when the telephone asked her the mission of the operation -- it was a very risky operation -- he responded to me that in that other country these kids would be very saturated, and they had to do it.
And what I said, "Well, have considered the political assistance instead of the right separation?"
The United States offers huge possibility to people to be who without forcing them to change for the welfare of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, in closing, I mean, I've been talking a lot about the parent.
And I want to think about what democracy would be.
And I want to say something a little bit radical, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different anatomic types, in particular, if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in interpretation, I've also been interested in researching sexual difference.
And one of the things that have been interested with is the differences between men and women in the way that they think and operate in the world.
And what we know from the cross-cultural studies is that women on average -- not all, but on average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to escape those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in grad school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered -- I was considered a feminist -- as now -- it made me an alien plant.
"Tell me what the feminism hungers have?"
And I thought, "That's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with deploying gender, so there's nothing feminine in the feminism."
But the more I ever thought of her question, the more it has seemed to me there is something feminine in the feminism.
I mean, there might be something on average, in average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable ones.
So while parents were very reluctant to find the way to protect people from the state, it may have injected more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the repetitive support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond the anatomy: thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect one, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, we are far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth more than their cost cost.
So we could easily bring the world into the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just replace it by business buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment was already properties and that the other half would still have to achieve it.
They could try to increase the capability by doing things in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that they face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the nuisance and the distributions of the build.
So it would be very difficult to do all those approximations.
But they could go to a whole new place, build a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place facilitate construction rather than putting them out.
So I proposed that governments create new enough reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under statue.
I later learned that roughly at the same time, Java and October were thinking about the challenge to reform Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 holes would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, Honduras.
In the next regular election, Peppe Lobby was improvised with a platform in which I promised reforms and at the same time.
He asked October to be his boss of gay.
Meanwhile, I was preparing myself to give a talk on TEDGlobal.
Through a process of performance, trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under status to their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those norms that say that you can't go and bother all the current restrictions of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes as much of technology as the norms to progress -- and it's usually the rules that prevent us to move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala, a friend of Guatemala, sent October a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed Japan.
They called me.
They said, "Let's put this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point on how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, October said, "Paul, maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city is a place where you start with the development terrain, a status that specifies the rules that will apply there and an option so people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the House president called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way our country forward.
She asked me to go to September and talk about nine and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which includes an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very large.
This is a picture of Denetic and the white line is the new airport that was built in Dene.
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the houses that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that measures at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody applaud correctly.
The faces of the audience were very serious and attacked.
The congestion leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor Rome, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my computer.
So I sat up and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explains the essentials -- that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could possibly be in Honduras.
And also including new choices for leaders.
Because the U.N. government leaders would need help from assistine countries -- they could benefit from the countries that would help them set up and make the standards of the status so that they could all trust that the status is indeed complimented.
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily accelerate about a thousand square miles.
And soon after the 19th of January, they vote in Congress to get their Constitution and add a constitutional device that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this painful, voters in Congress in favor of this constitutional regime was 124 to one.
All the parties, all the families in society, they sang it.
To include in the Constitution, you have to take two times in Congress.
17 of February was approved again in another voting from 114 to one.
Immediately after voting -- the 21 to February 24th, a delegation of about 30 holes was the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new great center of the city that's building in South Korea -- it's bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years to get the permits.
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in practice, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to come, and then they would allow to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow your Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new criminal system.
There are urbanism and construction buildings that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know is that they have a good number of habitats.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to install in America, especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million dollars a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet their parents that they haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in Hongon?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new leaders?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my homeless friends asked me to say, "Thank you."
I'm Jesse, and this is my value.
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public confidence, and that is, I live obsessed with the suits.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, to photograph and publish in my blog broken breaks, colorings and different for every time.
But nothing new.
All my clothes is a second hand of pulse markets and retail stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand is allowing me to reduce the impact of my superstring in the environment and in my chin.
I come to know interesting people -- usually my money goes to a good cause, and my appearance is unique.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be from my foot?
Will I like color like color.
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I won.
Going back to my value, I want to tell you what I spoke for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anyone bring up with all that clothing?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
Red in exactly a week is everything I've put in my valley.
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after getting here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't know me as the woman walking for TED in underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the songs for this week.
Doesn't it sound?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is really called tiger free.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You can hardly see a phenomenon for less than 50 dollars.
All the sudden, including the shock, cost me 50, and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
Long: color is energy.
It's almost psychologically impossible to be bad mood, when you're seeing a red red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: The integration is shipped.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
You just know yourself.
If you laugh from the right people, you don't just understand you, you will also appreciate you.
Microsofts: Guinea of the kid you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the distributions, or I remind you to your little seven years.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
Joe: trust is the key.
If you think you look at something, it's pretty sure you're not.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, you don't have to look at that you can't attract.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to get everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Video: A universal truth six words for you: Leathers go with everything.
And finally, I said, "Developing a personal style and unique is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people came up with this week just for what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little valley.
So before I go home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to give me emotional to these things, because on the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful and brilliant waiting, if there is a little love in my heart and searching.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side which is the intuitive part.
So if we use a scale to measure the attitude of every hemisphere, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you put your brain on this scale?
Some would choose for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the integrate in this audience -- your brain is something like this -- with a great appetite in both human hemispheres at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logic and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, which just like most other experiments, quantum quantum physicists, we need pretty logical to connect these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see as a reaction, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
Certainly intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be just somewhere at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, the development.
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and it didn't do it very well, it always stops.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar teaches a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to pass them, and they remain in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you are a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking walls, play with these bizarre particles.
And when they play their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really bizarre things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called quantum mechanics.
At that point, it was a few years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not so much.
And I've never seen them.
That is, no one saw a particles.
But it didn't fit well to my logical side.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a superstition of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom up a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little trick of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a piece of metal.
And so I did this almost like a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new, and I went to work all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this business in a form of swimming clay that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superstition, but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up to stop doing those things, because I don't want them to piss them, or actually, to frighten it.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that shines it and the wind that happens next to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to exploit all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We set up the lights, then we introduced an aspiration and we extracted all the air, and then we cooled it to a temperature of less than one degree above the absolute zero.
Now, by being on the elevator -- the little piece of metal is free to act as you want.
So we measured their movements.
We found it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of perfectly separate, I was vibrating. And the way it was vibrating was like an breathing like this -- like a fire that spread and contract.
And by giving a smooth push, we could make it film and not vibrate at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a vibration and not vibrate at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case -- all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal. And at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain instants when those are lined up.
In the rest of the time they are deployed.
It means that every atom is in two different places, which means that the whole piece of metal.
I think this is great.
Really.
I was going to lock into a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one single atom and that metal metal is roughly the same as the difference between that metal bit and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places, and that piece of metal.
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How would your consciousness do if your body was deployed in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we heat it, and we turned out the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was in one piece there.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all objects on the elevator actually are quantum objects that are just sitting in a little space.
You hear much about quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's deep reduction of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amy.
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job in Google, until I reached the idea to do something related to the idea of doing something related to the museum and art to my boss that is here and that allowed me to bring it out.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of business and stories, you know, with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There's a lot of stories that we did.
I think my own story is explained just on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I came from a great education -- not -- but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make reality of making it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than it shows the demo, to explain a couple of interesting things that we have taken out of his launch.
So simply let's go to Google.
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the galleries of the Galapagos, the MoMA, the Emily, the Resuch -- Van Gogh.
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites: the Metropolitan, the art Museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and page, we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombay, or Microsoft, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they split.
Do you want to navigate the museum?
We open up the plane up there, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the walk.
Keep forward. Have you gone."
They explore.
Thank you, but I don't get to the best.
Now I'm standing in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The Hodes of Pentium Bretton in Metropolit.
I see the seventh six.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's the whole information of metaphors.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to double-click right here.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the glass technology.
So this image, for example, it goes on, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million pictures?"
So I'm going to show you what you do with 10 million pixels.
It can make it around very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression.
But if you really wanted to deploy.
So I started playing play, and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems interesting.
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I investigate a little bit, I talked to some people in the Metropolitan, and I actually discovered that this is a game called "Freedom, which is to hit a cow with a pole on the Tuesday Tuesday.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get to the grounds.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to leave the picture, so you'll see really what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we go quickly to jump again to MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite, "The night standing night."
The example I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the paintings?
And if you want to see how Dan Gogh actually created this piece of master?
It turns it up, and it really achieves it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the night star," I think I'd never seen it that before.
I'm going to show you another favorite function of mine.
There are a lot of things out here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "college."
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a manifestation, that gives you the same way.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these pictures.
It's very simple, we enter -- I've created this function that I call "the power of the "or "The Power of the Gold, we just did a robot around it.
It's about "Love Machines in the National Gallery.
You can analyze things -- send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel in the context of these teachers.
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even even come from museums.
Maybe it shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital means to do justice to its art artwork, and it's repeatedly represented online.
And the big question I do today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum?"
And the answer is no.
It's to contemplate experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a pilot, a flying pixel.
In our lab we call it sensible design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian originally, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his dorm -- but the reason I'm showing you this is that something really interesting in Formula 1 in the last two decades.
It makes a long time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula car, took a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot.
This is what in engineering, you would call control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two components, a sensor and an accident.
Now what's interesting is that today's control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered by networks and electronics.
They're becoming computer computers.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently and can be detected.
To address cities is a big deal.
As a result, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's crust, but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
Seventy-five percent of energy consumption.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these detectors and activities are coming into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from Palestine Antonion by late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called "The Me Beautiful Mounting."
Well, our objects, the environment, begin to talk.
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms will become sensors and activists.
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
It's almost like in the old Minister of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo.
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, insisting in the idea of capturing the environment and achieving something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup, right?
Maybe some of you remember it, played Italy and France, and at the end of Zidlene gave the head.
And anyway, at the end of Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at activity in the net.
Here we see the city.
You see the Columbia in the middle and the Bore River.
It's morning, before the game.
Time is at the top.
For the afternoon there are people over here, and there is a call, moving around.
It starts the party: silence.
I Gulf from France.
Excuse, people are doing a quick call and goes to the bathroom.
Second time.
First extra time, second.
Zidley, and in a moment, the head.
Canal Italy, yes.
That night everybody went to celebrate the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day, they went to the center of the winner team and the first minister of time.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called Circle Massacre where, from the time, people will celebrate -- it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we would not have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection: it's not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they assemble it.
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags, to track the trash into its deployment by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were running, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that would be threatened.
Then we put a little chip, a tag to the trash and then we started tracking it.
These are the results.
Participating from Seattle.
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of inefficient.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist.
They're happening and there is a lot of internal transport.
But the other thing that we think is that if we see every day that the cup that we fly doesn't disappear -- that is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle that is still there is still there.
That if we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Asia Birdshone, could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to connect on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaradev.
It all began with a question of the city of the city, which came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was: How can technology, new technology, add that one?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop is, imagine that they have a glass and volts, volcanoes of solemn, legal legal legs that open up and shut down.
It's created as a water cut, with water pixels of water.
If you bring the pixels you can write on them, you will show patterns, images, text.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can go by, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the Bell mayor.
He liked a lot.
And there's a committee to design the building to the entrance of the Express.
We call it Digital Water.
All the building is made of water.
There are no door or windows, but when you approach it up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered by water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the salamanders, the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappeared, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody in the winter, when they lowered the roof, someone who was there and who said, "Democratically demonstrate."
No, it's not that they have demonstrated it, but when it goes down almost all architecture disappears.
Here it is running.
You see the people intrigued by what's going on.
And here I am myself trying to not be able to go through the sensors that open up the water.
I think it should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in Zarajara came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let you go, but a building that kept making slices and holes of water and you had to jump out and don't get wet.
(Audience people. And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty to do things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels, the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopter in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud.
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal confidence in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is light -- not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be able to get a 3D pixels that you can zoom in, and go through and see from very different angle.
This is the true controlled Florida, going down to form an V.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, from people's movement, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bolt -- one of the best bankers in today, the star of the New York City and the Millie Scalately, to capture their movements in 3D, and use them as an input for the Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels and catch it in different outcomes.
It's so much 3D digitization in real time as motion capture.
It can reconstruct all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and motion, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible input for Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- almost like a cloud of cloud -- like a barn, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody give a little bit for a pixel.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible across the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us -- we can move from the digital world, from self-organizing power, to the physical world.
In our case, we may want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That meant something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How will the digital world go from the digital world?
The idea is that we can make people become involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our clouds are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered from pixels.
You can move inside the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from below, it will serve to share the main moments of the Olympics.
So this is so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can climb up, as a new top of London here.
You can get there.
Like a new digital fat at nighttime, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
Suppose I told you, with just a few changes in your genes, you could enhance memory for a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in a better way, being stronger to get more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe, of themselves?
How about to live with good health?
Or maybe they are from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like?
What would you like if you could choose something?
Audience Member: Creativity Creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see here.
Leant. It was probably due to the number of people who are present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about long-lasting?
Oh, the majority, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something that would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been an online theme here at TED, but today I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great genomic genome of the 20th century, TED Doberoyozoi, who also computers in the Red Art Russell, wrote an essay called "National Nava" in biology makes sense of the light of evolution.
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is it the other or to us?
This is another looking at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well, at one end, it's clear that we are interested in.
We have a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some have gone back and forth.
We've been here about 130,000 years.
It may seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetes.
This isn't like human insulin -- but it's the same protein -- chemically inevitable, that comes out of the pandemics.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry in the more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antoine Dammid raises the automation -- think about bacteria?
The gut is a beautifully hospitable environment for those bacteria.
It's classified, dark, wet, it's very electronic.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want with no effort on your side.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional interpretation of some ferocious strength to the output.
But, of course, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digesting essential nutrients.
But what does the future stop?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the environment?
In this vast slide of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief composer, the animal kingdom, as a single and only companies -- and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entertainment part of this talk, so I hope you enjoyed it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
It was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the single-celled organisms, every cell will just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when the multicellular organisms appear to change things begin to change.
It enters sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction passing the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I thought, well, shocker, shock, death of sex seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year, I had more doubt.
I came to understand George Burners feeling that still acted in Las Vegas well in his 90s, years.
And one night someone hit their hotel doorstep.
He opens up the door.
In front of it, he finds a wonderful light dancer.
He looks at it and he says, "Come on for a seed sound."
"That's right," he says, "I choose the soup."
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different purpose to the goal of evolution, not necessarily contradictive, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to reclaim the health in the illness.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution consists of the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving, generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the rocket rockets designed to send genetic charge to the next orbital level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that you expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality, through my work.
I want to make it not dying."
Evolution doesn't necessarily need longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the bigger or the strongest or the strongest and not even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean the traffic bacteria that can survive the heat of the guerrillas that will occur, if there were fish there, fish cooked to the cow, however, they have managed to do that an electronic environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what is happening in evolution, and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the next -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that by medicine, first of all, we have known a lot of genes that otherwise would have been unleashed and removed from population.
And second, as a species, we've built our environment to adapt to ourselves as much as we adapt to him.
And by the way, we calculate, and we share so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation required for the evolution.
A second possibility is to produce a traditional type, natural type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll down, but they're inexpensive.
And in the absence of isolation: when as a species we collect distant planets are going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce the evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility -- an attractive possibility, intriguing and scary possibility.
I call it the new conversation, the new evolution, which is not just natural -- but sweater and chosen for us as individuals in the decisions we will take.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First we consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not something necessarily good for society but it's what is chosen at individual and family levels.
Just think that if you can choose not only the sex of your disagreement, but in your own body to do genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
What if we could do genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce cancer risk or eliminating the pollution?
Would you not want to make those changes in your genes.
If you look at the future, that kind of changes will be more and more possible.
The human Genome Project started in 1990, and slept 13 years.
It cost 2.7 million dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of human genome to a cost near the age of 20,000, and in a week.
It's not going to have a lot to do a lot to make the human genome reality for 10,000 and it will be more and more the scope of everyone.
They get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect ourselves from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against growing up in cells of a bank plant.
Can you imagine something good at the table?
That's reality today and in the future, it's going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little changes.
Can you change your body cells and if you could change your disagreement cells?
And if they could change sperm and volunteers, or change the velocity of the fine, and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate homosexuality, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier?
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also embrace superstring skills, a better memory.
Why don't you have the engineer's engineering from all if you could increase it with the next generation of the Machine computer?
Why don't we have a faster contribution muscle than allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why don't we live longer?
This is going to be inertiven.
And when we're in conditions of this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have converged the evolution of before in revolt.
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can buy it to 1,000 years and maybe it happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have for them.
Are we going to use these options in a better society, more successful, more considered?
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more version?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to deal with.
And the depth of all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these decisions?
For good or for worse, and before what I could think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're 90 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine making class, click, click.
Clay, click, classroom, classroom. It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting on the DVD.
It was the only one I could talk to flight assistants.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. We probably hit some birds."
The pilot had already looked at the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot aligns the plane with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
He shoots the engines.
Imagine being in a plane and no noise.
And then he said three words.
The three more advanced words I have heard.
He said, "Please prepare for impact."
I didn't have to talk to the flight warning.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life's finished up.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to repeat, all the experiences I ever wanted to have and never had.
While I was thinking about that, I came up with a sentence, which is, "Collection was bad."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to blow anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we did the George Washington Bridge, which was not for a lot of -- I thought, Wow, I really feel a great breath.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanities and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give rise to my ego.
And I regret the time I wasted on things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as I measured on that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like wonderful.
I don't try to make reason, I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock goes down, 15, 14, 18.
You see the water.
I'm saying, "Please fly."
I don't want this to break into 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we were barrassed, I had the feeling of, Wow, dying is not afraid.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go to my life.
And that sadness.
I wish I could see my kids grow up.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of artistic talented -- so --  And I scream, "Long, like a little bit.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
Of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I came up with a miracle, not die that day.
And it became another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your airplane, and please don't be like this -- but imagine, and how would you change?
What would they do, they still wait to do because they think they're going to live forever, right?
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy?
And most importantly, are they being the best parents that they can do?
Thank you.
I clearly have been blessed in life with many astonishing projects.
But the coolest I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called TEDx.
TEDx was one of the most important graphics in the 1980s.
One day, he came to her house after he ran and said, "Daddy, I feel an ant on the legs."
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today today has a total pandemic.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, so obviously the graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to sponsor Tony TEDTalk, and the cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with it?"
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that -- I saw Stephen Hawken -- is not that all the people with paralysis, can they communicate through those appears?"
And he said, "No, unless you're somebody important, you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable.
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody see the movie "The Scarl and the Marriage?"
They communicate that way -- they go through the finger.
I said, "That's archael. How can it be?
So I sat up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that sign a kid that I didn't have the slightest idea of how he was going to cover it.
I was committed with her brother and her father there at that moment there at that point, "Okay, this is the thing: Tony's going to talk about, we'll build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous.
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called GPHIN Gratority Research Lab, who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser fix, they draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around doing art installation like this.
All the things that are coming, they say, they are part of a cycle of life.
First they start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and at the end, people begin to make art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentations.
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side to another had a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine for TEDx to communicate -- a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun -- I call him You because when you talk to the guy you get an email of it, and you say, "I don't deserve it. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corner -- to our house.
My wife, the boys and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and consumers and analysis took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid and that when we came back the squares of the walls and the place would have graffiti in place.
But for two weeks, we went to the March of Venice, my son was part, my dog also, and we created this.
It's called Everglades Calculus, "TED and you can see the description.
They are a pair of cheap sun glasses, which we bought in the March Vancer ship, some armature camel and things from Homo State and Radio Shack.
We took a PDP camera, we open it up, we put it on a LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and it is constructed -- you publish the free code -- the software goes down.
And we create a device that doesn't have limited at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital to say no."
Any person with partners today has access to drawing and communicating using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you, that was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the TED room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this buses and attack during the great insurgency.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense sentences all night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so he could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the park outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and he would imagine what the feeling was in the parking room.
The funny thing was we had to break into the parking season, so we felt like we were reading the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email, and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to rescue me and pull out that I could breathe."
Isn't it amazing?
In a way, that's our war of war.
That's what keeps us moving, developing ourselves.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a Machine screen.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free. None of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great."
Armstrong took something about us, and then, in December, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventors in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what it ends up from closing the circle, is that in April this year at the MIT Geographic center at the center of Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art in the Street."
And "Art in the streets will have the best exposures of urban art, Bank Fairea, CAPTA -- all of them are going to be there.
TEDx is going to be in the show.
So basically, this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, it can happen.
Nothing of what there is in this room was possible -- the scenario, the computer, the microphone, the Calcology -- nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with an eye technology technology -- I just acknowledged something and was associated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us to do every day when we meet something that we feel to do -- if it's not now, when? And if I am not me, what?"
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years by staying in very difficult situations and at the same time a lot dangerous.
I went to prison, hard.
I worked on a coal mine. dangerous.
It filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- funny at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been suggesting in awful situations with the only goal to try and examine social questions in ways that are compelling, interesting, and hopefully analyze them in a way that they look at entertainment and accessible for audiences.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and paradox wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an airplane in Erajo.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter -- I offered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following, "OK, AIDS is present -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as content can explode in the face, especially if I put it on ridicule to you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good medical opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
Thank you.
It's a proposal in progress, by the way.
So even with that savings knew that someone would buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we examined the world of marketing.
And as I said before, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be prepared to me, nothing could be anxious, to something as difficult or as dangerous as stepping out with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan Spring: I want to make a film that is treating the production of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is funded by producing products, marketing and published.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever sell."
What happens in "The largest film ever sold is that all over the top at the bottom at the bottom of the beginning, in principle, has images of brand, all the time, from the assumption that appears before the title, the X-ray brand.
Now this brand, Calcutta Studdyn, the Stanfords Center.
These people will be fascinated to the perception of perpetuation forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, (MS: It's a return."
I'm a reductionist period.
It was "Abstract."
But we're not just going to have the paradigm of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure we can pull all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe and become the most cool shoe you've ever used.
The most cool car that you've ever drove in "The largest film ever sell, the best trajectory you have been drunk, coast of "The biggest film ever sell."
Captain Koko: The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, make them to fund the film?
The goal of complete film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, the whole film of beginning to end.
And I would love that CEO to help make it happen.
Robert Fridge: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear, it's the ultimate respect for the audience.
Good, though, I don't know how welcoming the people are going to be.
TK: You have a perspective -- I don't know if "good is very negative, but you know how he's going to replicate? (Music: No idea. (Make Core."
MS: A million and a half -- (DK: All right! John Kamen: I think it's going to be difficult, the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big brand.
TK: Who knows, maybe for the moment we get the film, we see it as a bunch of joyful languages.
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart Rudaper: Most of the answers will be not."
MS: But will it be hard to sell it, for the film or for being I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... it means you're not very optimistic.
So help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. (MK: Okay. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands brands.
MS: Yeah.
MK: We have some places where to go.
MS: I thought "happened to the camera meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
The camera means "We don't want to know anything about your movie."
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these suddenly disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and stage of separate media is not the idea to rely on that new vehicle that is going to bring the message to mass?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a fatal mistake, and that mistake was this.
Actually, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture represents.
See, when you look for images of transparency in Google --  -- this is one of the first images that appear.
I like your way to rotate, Sergey Brian. No.
This was the problem: transparency, free of simulation or enemy, easily detect or seen, which is characterized or accessible -- which is characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially in business practices, being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name, the president of the name, even the CEOs name it.
But suddenly when it comes to make it really changes something changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear --  -- like that weird bear.
It's unpredictable --  -- like this weird rural pathway.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it?
Eat a whole mouse of Colony Whitopia.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell our story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me to some lie -- and there is him looking at me as I used to do -- he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and there's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirken of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take my mind and I would have to take my mind and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to warn suddenly -- what I started to realize, is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, massive, giant movies and others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood films, giant salarmes, say the reason their movies are so successful because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these large, giant Hollywood films, Hollywood films, Hollywood?"
And the movie is called "The largest film ever sell."
How are we going to see Bangladesh in the movie?
Every time I am to go out, every time I open my bottle, you'll see the description of Bangladesh.
At any given moment in an interview with someone can say, "You're fine for this interview?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you calm down.
Maybe you should put some of this before the interviewee."
And there was one of these fabulous arms.
Both Florida as "Viscues of Pantheon will have its opportunity.
We're going to have as much for men as a woman, solar, blocks, whatever.
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a promising view.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
Similar to smaller movies we have, we are rather a rival brand.
So we don't have the budget.
So doing things like that, you know, to remind people Ban is why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe to Bang?
It's in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Woman: Technology higher.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put on the athlete.
Man: We talk about something abused, fat.
I think "regrett" is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus smell and south."
It keeps you.
How do we keep a lot more time?" With better fat, more fat, three times faster.
Things like those who are missing the benefits.
MS: And that's a multi-consumption company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the common Pepsi.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your brand.
Man: My mark?
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: I'll revive the 1980s, pandemic pandemic unless it is dancing up.
MS: All right, what is the Barge March?
Green: Something unique. (MS: Nine." Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a dark glamorous.
I like a lot of the dark colors, lots of gray and things like this.
Usually I carry access like sunglasses, or I like crystal and such.
Woman: If Dan was a brand, it could be a classic convertible: Mercedony Benki.
Man 2: The brand I am, calling it "washing flight.
Woman 2: In part, in a hopping, in part of a boy named Brooklyn, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of matrix.
I see toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is Ferring because I train the market.
Man 5: Five screen screen Marcle.
Is that something?
And Android: I'm a lawyer.
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand, but I often rank myself on the interpretation of dark glamorous and casinon flight.
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone to get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call "the "strength Personality."
And I found a company called Olone Zawadan in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Newton, February, Hamlet to discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
And About: The photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photo.
AT: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
AT: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world where you live -- like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things originates and start in a place and start in my case and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AO: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next is the best day of my life."
AT: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
AT: Tell me about "Why does that serve us?
What is the machine? How do you find now?
Why is it important? What does the red.
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you are.
What other mammal have you had?
It has to be scary. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: Ah! (Audience: Thank you. No, thank you.
AT: Thanks for your patience -- (MS: Grand work. AO: Yeah. (Am: Thank you very much. All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all this.
Linda Malawi: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different places, but complex, in your brand, Marcus Spring is a considerable brand.
They are spreading very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or in the other rather than focusing on both of them.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the human nature -- to avoid things that are not safe -- they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them you and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the classic one, Apple here.
And you can see here to Target, Win, Mini Copenhagen and Jetnakist.
Now there are legal markings and conscious marks, those things that have gone and come and come up with a considered market is something pretty powerful.
MS: A local marking." What's your mark?
If someone asks you to describe your identity of brand, your branding, what would it be?
Are you an advertised attractive? Are you somebody who makes blood flows?
Or are you rather an attractive attribute?
A little bit more called, reserved, conservative.
The transcendent attributes are like being a doctor to be fresh like President Prize, contemporary and adventure or audacity like Eronic Flinter, fast or gold, professional, domestic or mystic like Gandhi.
Or are you rather attractive attribute?
Are you unconscious, sophisticated like 2074?
Are you standardized, traditional, province, protester, you identify with Oppenst?
Are you confident, stable, family relative, confident, safe, complete or wise like the Dalai Lama or You?
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, addicted and disconnected, who said, "No, don't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would not have control over the end.
They allowed us to tell the story of the neuroscience, and we came to tell the story in this film of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain as much for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Paulo where they prohibit the outdoors in the air.
In all the city over the last five years, there are no fangs, there are no pills, no fangs, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing in schools with limitation problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I have had more success is those where I've been interacting with things directly.
And that's what these brands did.
They took the intermediaries, they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that will make people think, that will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has they left? Did they succeeded on?
Well, from the movie in the Florida Flock, let's take a look.
According to Bureau the movie in January and since then, and since then, -- and this is not all -- we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a couple of weeks and a half.
That's just online, no press, no TV.
The movie hasn't been distributed.
It's not online. It's not in superstrone.
It's not even present in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun winning momentum.
And it's not bad for almost all the agencies that we talked to her customers, not to be part of it.
I've always believed that if you risk yourself, if you take risks, that there are opportunities.
I think that when you get people out of that, it's pushing them to fail.
I think that when you train your employees at the loss of the risk of the risk is preparing all your company to stop rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to advance is we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to not have fear of the opportunities that can frighten them.
Ultimately, I think we have to give rise to fear.
We have to put that bear.
We open the fear. We open the risk.
From a hacker at once, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to beat transparency.
Today, more than a little bit of honesty will go through a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk "Look for Transparency has been introduced by my good friends of ECM who, for 17,000 people bought the rights of the name in eBay.
EM: Become big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
ECM presents transparency."
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So Morgan, in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those 170?
MS: It's an outstanding question.
In my pocket I have a child from the TED matrix of TED, the Salawate Foundation, a child for 177,000 to be applied to my TED for the next year.
The idea behind the Steunh Computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the rise plant in Natanisma.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speed and valves, we can cause a lot of problems with cellulose.
The Greek boxes don't use Windows from Windows -- they are from a completely different technology.
But if we could get an effective virus from Windows in a wearable computer used by an engineer to confirm this gray box, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind Steum.
We started with a Winner sandwich.
The blind income to the gray box, gives the cellulose, and the nuclear program is embedded.
It's easy, right?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching about Stephen six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown as well.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the Windows part of Windows," the insult would use multiple vulnerability vulnerabilities.
It seemed to do something with these gray, these control systems.
That was called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Stephen and we saw what happened with this.
So they went very strange.
Steumn behaves like a lab of lab to the one who didn't like our wife: the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then from experimenting with different cheese tastes, I realized, and I thought, "This is a driver attack.
It's completely distracted."
The installor is looking for actively in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working on that place.
If not, Steinberg doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what's the goal?
It could be, let's say for example, an American energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we discover the goal soon.
So we extracted and we compiled the attack code, and we found that it was structured, in two digital pumps, a little and a big one.
We also saw that they were highly armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points for you to attack.
You probably even know how much of the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that Steunh installor is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old scarless language.
I want to tell you how we could make sense of this code.
What we were looking at at first were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We then searched temperatures and data structures and we were trying to relate to the real world, with the objective potential of the real world.
We need some theories about disasters that we could approve or disappear.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent book, it must be a valuable white white, and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been reported.
They don't find several thousands of targets in that area.
Basically it boils to the nuclear power plant of Bush and the name of Natasha exercise.
So I said to my assistant, "Tell me a list of all the experts in central centers and energy plants among our customers."
I called them and consulted them in an effort for contributing their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital bird with the cortex controls.
The robot is that mobile part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see.
If you drive the speed of this robot, you certainly can dump it up and even make the choreography explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and discover an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to decipher the digital bird looking very close to the data and its structures.
So for example, 1656 in that code, you can't obviously obviously.
I started researching scientific literature on how these centers are built in Natasha, and found that they are structured in what's called a candidate, and every cascade contains 1664 cellulose.
That made sense: there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These centrifuseles in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find?
An almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had among hands.
So there's no maltrum, it didn't.
The results have been received after several weeks' work.
We normally ended up in street shops, and we had to get back again.
Still, we found that both digital birds were pointing to one single and same goal, but from different angles.
So the small bird is taking a back, and doing the robots and sandwich them, and the big bird communicates with six strokes and manipulating voltages.
In addition, we're really confident that we've determined what the destiny is.
It's Natasha, and it's just Natasha.
We shouldn't worry about other targets to be achieved by Steunh.
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really impressed me.
There's the gray box there, and up to see the cellulose.
What this thing does is to intercept the value values of the sensors, for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provides legitimate code, which still execute during the attack with false data categories.
And believe it or not, this false entry data is presented by Steunh.
It's kind of like Hollywood movies where, during the robot, the security camera is fed by prepared video.
Is it great on it?
The idea here is obviously not just to guide the operator in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive actually.
The idea is to make a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not perform fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine is taken, you have to open up velocities on a millisecond.
Obviously this can't do a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're committed, then they can happen bad things.
The plant can blow up.
And neither or the operating system will notice it.
That freaked out.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is generic.
It has nothing to do with cellularies, specifically, with control enzyme.
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or in a car factory.
It's generic.
And you don't have a kind of -- to disseminate this burden with a USB key.
You could also use conventional technology of gas to disseminate it.
The most possible.
And if you did that, what you ended up with is a cyber of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We need to face the implications, and we better start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Raleigh, it's made public in many ways that people assume that the Mozart is the main entities behind this.
What is your opinion.
Ralph Long: Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. Okay.
My guess is that the Mozart is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The motor behind this is cyber survival.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, fortunately.
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for fear. Thank you, Ralawa.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry up and give superstring skills or someone else that makes use of wheelchair and go back to walk.
In Berthur Biotechnicks, we call these robots.
It's nothing different from something that goes in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and helps you, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other foreign tests.
This is not an unreal idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take on its back a 45 pounds, and it's demanding to bring even more teams.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to take this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to HCG2 -- or Portugue human Cargolists.
Soldier: With the HIV/AIDS exoskeleton I can carry 90 pounds for variables for many hours.
Its flexible design, it allows you to put in candles and run movements with great agency.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I increase my strength and my resistance.
Ellen Bend: We're ready, with our industrial partner partner, to produce this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the look at the basements of the wheelchair chairs, which I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 66,000 million people around the world, worldwide.
Like one percent of the whole population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens, very young people, with damage in the vertical column that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about population that aging that is rapidly multiplied.
His only choice, a lot of times -- for a cerebral injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from their successful appearance, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you to the ESP who's using Amanda Boton who 19 years ago, he had a lesion in the vertical column, and as a result, he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Both: Thank you.
EB: Amazing is using our ELAM, which I mentioned.
It's got some sensors.
It's completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals down to the computer on the board on board over here on the back.
There's also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the houses, and on the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural sand.
RB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when I was a bizarre jump in the air, looking down at the bottom side.
In a fraction of second, I lost all the sense and all the motion of the penguin down.
Shortly on, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Ladie, I'll never walk again."
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last mix of my self.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn how to slide down on screen, climbing rocks and even riding a hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk on, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to Amartma, and all the wheelchair users, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battery, they practice sex to say hi and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Festival Man Festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, know their cousins to know.
This is the world of wild bonds.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known by their aggressive.
But unfortunately, we've done too much incident in this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by big, arrogantic, society society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where mortal violence hasn't yet observed.
But unfortunately, Bonobos are the least understood of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it's been very difficult to study them.
Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity.
It's not surprising that this destruction also raises the survival of the Bonobo.
The meat meat and deforestation do that you can't fill or a stadium with the bonobos that are sitting in the world -- and honestly, we're not safe of it.
But in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hiding on the trees.
Who are these prizes?
We know them like the apes "have love, not the war -- because they have frequent sex, promiscuity and baseball to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity since the life of bonobos is more than Kamen Suture.
Bonobos, like humans, love to play along your life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for them the game is critical to establish associations and foster tolerance.
We learn to trust and learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with generations of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of interactions, diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of videos of the wild middle.
First of all, it's a ball of ball style button -- not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male.
Look what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, the back of ball."
I just think in this case I love it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as much as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like the testosterone -- and also how play requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time it's more fun.
But play is polio.
The game is polio, it can take a lot of shapes, some of which are more cold, imaginative imaginations, curious -- maybe the place where the astonishing is.
And I want you to see -- this is Fuck, a young female who is playing with widened water.
I think, like it, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we shape are the real seed of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our adoption of adaptation.
To adapt us with success to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's harness the majority of our game capacity?
The game is not father.
The game is essential.
For Bonobo and human, life is not just cruel and deployed.
When it seems like the least appropriate, they can be the moments that the most urgent thing is.
So primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for development from a nonprofit organization called Robin Hook.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I combine fires as a captain assistant in a body of volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers have a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain -- I was caught in a conversation with the owner who certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night -- she was standing outside in the rain, under a parachute, in paper, whispering as his house was on fire.
The other volunteer.
The dog." I was so cold.
There was a lawyer or a management of money that, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people who came into a business building in calls to save a live live just because it earned me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me an adventure.
He said, "Benights, I need to be in the house.
I need you to go up, go through the fire, and bring it to this woman a couple of shoes."
I just swear.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was -- I climbed the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the real bombs that would have finished to turn out the fire and entered the fourth main room in search of a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back on the stairs where I met my Names and the beautiful dog on the main doorstep.
We took away from the house for the house of house where, as it was to wait, his treasure.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house of house against the courageous effort demonstrated to save his home.
The kindness that she looked at all over the other was that someone had gone even a couple of shoes.
Both in my voice in Robin Hood, like my voice as a volunteer bomb I'm witness for acts of generosity and kindness on a monument scale, but also about acts of grace and courage at individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have done, or they are to achieve remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: Don't expect.
Don't expect to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give it now.
They serve food in a car, they wipe up a neighborhood park.
Be mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day, we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So train the game, save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Bez! Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first few blocks of concrete are made in 1864, with a very simple idea, spinal cord modules that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to LED came up with this.
He was called automatic astronomy brick.
And in a few years, the LIGO laws came to all the homes.
It's been estimated that they have been made over 400 billion or 75 bills per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LGBT made it accessible.
LGB just adopted the block of concrete, the favorite, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to answered: the new building block.
The transistor was a small amount of plastic that would take us from a world of static cities attached to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows to create much larger circuits and more complex circuits -- a brick at once.
But there's a major difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Lebanese.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Libraries are electronics each with a specific function.
They're hardwired to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they get together by magnets together.
So you can't put in a wrong way.
The bricks.
The green is the room, the blue is the current, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So we just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly can begin to make bigger circuits to begin to do.
A blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a regular.
If you change the button, you change the button, which is here, and now we have an intriguing light.
We added this board to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, Lebanese are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and soldier, Lebanese allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make it blink faster, or slower, it just turns out this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind Lebanese is that it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to be reduced to bricks ready to use.
Lights, sound, solar panels, motors -- everything must be accessible.
We've given Liberations to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how do you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a daylight works, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We've also taken Little Libraries to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience any experience in electronics begin to play with Lebanese as a material.
Here you can see with bottles of paper and fine, we have George create.
(Nature sounds)  A few weeks ago we took Lebanesees to the designers of Rhode Island design -- who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a chain of confidence active activity.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a land made of plastic that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, Lebanese became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be aware of everyone.
So Lebanese has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world where we live, this interactive world, is our own.
So fast-forward and invented.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little business seeks to engage with the environment focused on.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm. Wait for a moment.
You can get a little bit in charge.
We can continue to better leave the video to one side.
No.
This isn't ...
All right.
CSP technology is ...
Oh, I'm afraid time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched an initiative to reclaim the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything they are supposed to detect, and we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called "Cooper for America and would be like a couple of Peace Parks for telephones.
We select some members every year and put them to work with menus.
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the so-called municipal world.
They made great applications. They worked with municipal jobs.
Its task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
They know Al Allen.
It's a Bangladeshi town.
Here it appears as if it would look for a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone calls it when it's caught by the snow because it knows it's not very good at getting fire when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask help in this single way?
Last year in Boston we had a team of measles from Code for America."
They were there in February and at that moment I had a lot of this last year.
They realized that the city never wiped up these hydrogens.
But one of the members called Erik Michons noticed something else: that citizens wipe up with shovels right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can take a hair.
You accept to wipe it up.
When you do it, you put a name, in this case put it.
If you don't do it, someone can be beaten.
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications programmed last year.
But it does something that no other government technology arrived.
And it goes into viral form.
A responsible for the Hole City system to see this app realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to deliver standards of tsunami.
It's very important to work these suits of tsunami, but people steal the batteries.
So he asks citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens wear the damages of the captured.
And Chicago just launched it to make people refuse to clean sidewalks when they snow.
So now we know nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has spread out without fractions, in organic and natural ways.
If you know some government technology you'll know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that required three people for two months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that we had done for normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the California power of California that all over the time has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of governance.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days and spread in viral form is a kind of exhaust to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not like private companies, like many people think that should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without restrictions and open and generous.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that represents the way to deal with the question of the government who has the new generation, not as a problem of an incurable institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only Code for America, but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to civic apps every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't complain about, fix it.
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line at the DVD -- and all of those other things that get us insane, the government is essentially in words of Tim Rill, what we do together because we can."
Now, a lot of people have adapted government.
If you're one of those people, you would ask them to recognize it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change -- the government is.
And because the government in the last instance of us -- remember that from "We, the village?" The way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as many people thought the government is to choose people to make charges.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about British.
This is the center of phone care and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you check 31 in the U.S.
Scott appealed this call.
English in the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open up the gates of the house, put strong music and see if it's going on?"
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the Barragements.
Boston has no center of flames.
It has an app and websites and phone called Citizens Connecticut.
We don't program that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New York City of Boston.
One day, this happened really, this is a listener, "Hang on my trash skull. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to take it?"
The dynamic of Captain Connecticut is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Congolese Connecticity everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I went to the place, I found the trash cube behind the house.
Zarrett? Yes. Oh, live? Yes.
I turned out the cube. I went home.
Good nights, sweet bag!"
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the tech definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to automatically help each other.
So one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role of paper.
I connected the two people.
And it could have connected to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we strengthen communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader? We sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfy our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15.
Underneath there is what we call bureaucraticians.
And we say that word very slowly.
But it is that despair that keeps that that belongs to us that we finance as something that operates in our agreement, that other thing, and we actually are losing power.
People believe politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to function that we will have to make the bureaucracy be sense.
Because that's where the real government is happening.
We have to collaborate with the government of government.
That makes the October movement.
Have you seen it?
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of the ALS electronics project on the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's a bureaucratic activity.
And for those of us who have given us to the government, it's time we ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see enormous challenges that they will have to deal with.
Do you really believe that we will get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in names of everybody?
We can't rely on government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to reactivate the government function so that it can expand the civilian society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act with manuals, you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years -- so I am a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that nearly for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk about, everybody's going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channels at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem don't care much to do their voices.
They're using their hands.
Put hands to the work to program applications that do better to government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a hair by taking a hair by shaking weeds and enveloping a trash cube that has a browser.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those hydrogen and lots of people do it.
But these applications are as digital reminder that we're not only consumers -- we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes, and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we don't fix the city.
So I want to ask all the speakers -- when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we'll be a manual manual?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prison, prisons and on death row.
I've spent most of my life in slums, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED, watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I've noticed, in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here are impact around the world.
At times, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is really important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach yourself with consent, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- it's caring, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a African-American family dominated by a marriage, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She started a lot of the arguments in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about 1840.
She was born about 1830 and his experience with slavery confirming the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also loving.
When I was a little and looked at her, she came up with me and gave me a good hug arm.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then backed me.
One or two hours later, I went back and looked at it, and he came up with me and said, "Bronze, you still feel my apple?"
And if I said that, I was going back again and if I said yes, I left myself in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be near it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower in the 10.
At times, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture your time and your attention.
My cousins were running around.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At the beginning, I thought it was a game.
So he looked at her and smiled, but she was very serious.
After 15 -- 20 minutes, she got up the room, he grabbed his hand and said, "Go Broadway. We are going to talk."
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, "Bronze, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anyone.
I said, "Okay, Mama."
She said, "I'm not going to do this." I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know what I've been looking at.
And he said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do anything."
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to give me three things, Brian.
I said, "Sure, Mama."
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
He said, "She's my daughter, and you have to pretend me to take care of her."
As I loved my mom, I said, "Yes, Mama, so I'll do."
Then he said, "I'm the second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing."
I thought it and said, "Yes, Maham. So I'll do."
Then finally he said, "I'm the third thing I want you to do is you never drink alcohol babies."
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Mama, so I'll do."
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a brother one year older and a sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15.
We just came up with all the time.
He took a beer seat, offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's good. You know, but I'm not going to take beer."
My brother said, "Come on. I do it, and you always do the same as we are.
I got something, your sister also took a break."
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can go."
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a break."
I looked at it with force and continued, "Oh, don't be that you're still thinking about the conversation with Mama."
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, "Mama tells all the grandchildren that are special.
I was delivered.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread up.
But I am 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking that it is a virtue. I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really make sense.
We can't get things that don't believe that they could do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been pressing during the proposition.
My aunt died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that we had to be able to commit to.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
Nowadays there are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor and black communities, it is so much description, so much despair.
One of three black black between 18 and 30 years is in prison, or in parole.
In urban communities across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Walter, 50 to 60 percent of all the color chicks are in prison, or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race -- it's also about it to poverty.
In this country, we have a court system that is much better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor, and innocent.
It's not a collapsed, but wealth.
And we seem to feel very quiet.
The politics of fear and face make us believe that these are not problems our problems.
We are disconnected.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious development work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, they serve you from right for always if you have a criminal condition.
Right now in Alabama, 34 percent of the black population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we project it to the next 10 years, the level of rights loss will be as much as it was before it was before they were approved by the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where you feel like 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no chance to go out.
Right now we're in process of some literature.
The only country in the world.
It represents people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, they have taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the commissioners?
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way to look at it, it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the committeed crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
Death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
In every nine people, it's identified one that is innocent that is excited and liberated from the death of death.
An amazing rate of mistake, an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow us to fly airplanes if every nine you would take away, you would have struggled.
But somehow we isolate ourselves from the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American stories, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorists, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and dropped up to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by horror.
In many communities, people were afraid to be linked.
They were worried to be bombed.
The threat of terror was what their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say to me, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks about the people who stop saying that in our history we live for the first time with terror, after 1119.
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The era of terror, obviously, with segregated and decades of racial sub-Saharan and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about race. I think it's because we're unwilling to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial satisfaction without a truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country, we haven't.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty conference.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers came after my presentation and said, "You know it's okay to hear what you mean?"
Addiscopathy: "We don't have death row in Germany.
We might never have it here."
The room was sitting in silence and a lady said, "There is no way to our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we would internationally, and deliberately, we were going to be able to run people."
This is a statement about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany would run people especially if they were in their most Jewish mothers?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these difficult issues, positive things and wonderful things are not yet implemented.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology. We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are surprised by suffering, abuse, degradation, indiscrimination.
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We last talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more decisions with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that doesn't want to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ends)
To think of them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though it's so rational, so committed to the intellectual.
With innovation, with creativity, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from the ideas of food as well.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not only the brilliant and underneath, but also in the dark and hard.
Vaccine Haweline, the great leader leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering, we had all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in sites of despair and being treaties."
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be engaged.
There's no disconnect with technology and design, which allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to exclusion, to inequality, to influence.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts constitutes an identity much more challenging than if we ignore these things.
Let's find them.
I had the great privilege. I was a very young lawyer to meet Rosa Parks.
These women get together just to talk.
Occasionally, the Caribbean lady called me to say, "Know, the Paraguay Mrs. We're going to gather to speak.
Do you want to come and hear us?"
I said, "Yes, lady. Yes I want."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?"
I said, "Listen, listen.
So I went and just heard them.
It was very vignerable, very lightweight.
And at one occasion he was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, the Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now Brown, I think that's that idea of the equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been wrongfully convicted.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sense of life, without parole.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We try to end up with mass incurables."
I gave him all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, "Mom Umm Memo."
And he said, "Even to be adopted, very fat."
At that time, the Mrs. Carry incidented, he put my finger in the face and said, "That's why you have to be very, very valuable."
I think, really, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to figure out how to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst we have ever made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not a bread.
Even if someone kills another, it's not a museum.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not it.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very small, very stimulating, we're not going to judge ourselves for our technology, for our designs, or for our intellectual ability or rational capacity.
At the end, you judge the character of a society, not as much as they treat the rich, powerful and private, but for the way they treat the poor, the condoms, the prisons.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly deep themes about what we are.
Sometimes I'm willing to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much strength.
It's sort of like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been feeling very hard.
I go to prison, and I see my 13 and 14 years old, which have been skilled to be played for adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what it isn't it?
The judge stands as an adult, but I see a child.
One night later, I was awake -- by God, if the judge can become something that you weren't, it must have magical powers.
Yes, Brazil, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think properly, but I started working on a mission.
I had a 14-year-old client.
I started working on the monkey, with a screen that said, "Machine for my black clip to be treated as a previous privileged white of 75 years, executive from a corporation."
In the application, I found that there had been indecent behavior in action, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a line on how in this country there is no ethical, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that missing meaning would be a dream or really write it?
For my horror, not only had it rediscovered it, it had sent it to court.
They spent about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally decided -- I have to go to papercutting for this stupid case.
I jumped into the car, and I felt really overwhelmed.
I left myself in the car.
I thought this would be very difficult and uncomfortable.
I finally got out of the car. I walked into the judge.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black black man, was the conservative of the judge.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "It's you able to bounce?" I said yes.
So I came up with me and hug me.
And I whispered in the ear.
She said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that it was viggraging.
That was profoundly connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I entered the audience room.
When you arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this beautiful mold?"
I said, "Yes, sir. I was me." And we started to argue.
People started to go. They were all infinite.
I was the one who had written those crazy crass.
They came up with the cops the fiscal fiscalations, the auditories.
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all the great ones because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye he reached to see the consensus that she was going and she was coming.
He was looking at the window and he was going to hear all that free.
It kept walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black of concern came into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge described a recession.
During the break, an asteroid of the apple was shown because he had entered the room.
The attack was stuck on the old black.
And he said, "James, what do you do in the audience room?
And the old black stood up, I looked at the assistant and looked at me and said, "I went to this room room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the objective with the migration."
I've come today to TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow in the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be evolved if we don't worry about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is bound to other people.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity should be tied to the freedom, compassion and justice.
And above all, those of the speakers that share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with firm.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious desire of the audience, of this community, to help your purpose to do something.
Something that's not a chicken. What can we do?
LS: There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's a referendum this spring.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, over the next five years.
And despite this, 46 percent of the homicides are not running in arrest.
56 percent of rapes don't get nowhere.
Here's a chance of change.
This referendum is going to propose that these funds are described to make the law, to safety.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the U.S. in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you to do with the biggest rate of income.
What would you say that you think that is?
LS: Actually, the rate of crime with violence, has remained relatively stable.
The great growing growth in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase comes into prison population.
And we let us convince the seat of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to perpetrator chain, to steal a bicycle, for little crimes against property instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of criminals and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy on punishment doesn't do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brenote, you have excited about us today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.
Local! They grow the threats for Bin Laden.

Oh, my God."
Peter Diamonds: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months. They would casually be in the last six days or of the last six years.
The idea is that media means prefer to provide negative news news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can possibly occur.
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first side of all of those data is an ancient snippet of the temporal lobe, called the lamprender.
The amygdala is our early warning detection, the danger detector.
Oldenburg and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a dozen stories we will prefer to look at the negative.
That old adage of the press, "If there's blood, "do it sell -- it's very true.
And because all of the digital devices provide us the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising we are positive.
It doesn't surprise that people think the world goes from bad in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get distances.
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- the climate change, the extinction of species, the scarcity of water and energy -- certainly we have them.
As human beings, we're really good at overcoming problems, and in the long run, we end up with them.
We analyzed then in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than doubled, the average average per capita adjusted by inflation has tripled.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has gone from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy that global literacy spent 25 percent to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to make expectations more and taller.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, a lot of people living under the poverty line have electricity, water, bags, refrigerators, television, air conditioning and cars.
The magnetic magnets of the last century, the women on the planet would never have dreamed of such luxury.
solidifying a lot of this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that comes from the information technology in this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the performance performance in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a superstring in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and in peace, in terms of depression and agenda.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop in any of the big challenges.
And even though it's plotted on a law on the left, it turns up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster.
And in this curve, the marriages of Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in Australia's called infinite computation, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on the planet -- synthetic biology, fuels, vaccines and food, the digital medicine, the national medicine and the AI.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" from BMW?
It was threaten.
I looked at the newspapers, the best headline that I could.
And I loved this one: "Water sells to human opponents.
Justice is not an easy game.
It plays the human language matters.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Sincaria University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to link a company, or a product or service that can actually affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have sounded absurd.
Today we can point up a dozen companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create fancy life for every inhabitant on the planet -- it's about creating a life of possibility.
It's about taking that out of that which is scarce, and it turns it up.
You see, it's contextual and technology is a force that liberates resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Navage II from the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited to dinner the king of Simon.
Napoleon troops ate with plastic coppers, and the same Navadon, with gold covers.
But the king of Simon, he ate with aluminum covers.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet -- it's worth more than gold and platinum.
That's why the tip of the memorial to Washington is of auditory.
You see, although the aluminum is 83 percent of the Earth's dough, it doesn't come as pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and skills.
But then the electrons came up and made it so cheap that we use it as if it was described.
We project this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet bad for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 techniques of energy every 18 minutes.
It's not about scale, it's about accessible.
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the gene generated by deliberation: 8,000 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT posted a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the southern parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents.
And if we have plenty of energy we have plenty of water.
Let's talk now about wars.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan put the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after that Saturn?
I got a famous picture. How did he call it?"
"One pale blue dot.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent per water.
Yes, 971 is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight for five percent.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
Authority comes, the nanotubes.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the interconnections of the broccoli -- I'd like to share with you, I would like to share with you, his technology called Shinela -- maybe you know it -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of water to the day of any source, salty water, pollution, a little little light -- for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coke just agreed to do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have a full confidence that I mean, Coca-Cola will implement it globally, in 600 countries on the planet.
This is an innovation that's made by this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in the phones.
My gosh, we're going to get to 70 percent of the penetration of the mobile phones in the developing world by late 2013.
Think about it, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having an intelligent mobile smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information and communication that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- GPS video, images, images, libraries of books and music, technology diagnosis technology now develops and lose market value with cellphones.
Maybe the best thing is when you get health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Clashrins Foundation, something called the X Prime Prime Prize, of 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and since they have A, they can fear, they can extract blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnosis than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where it's about 25 percent, and there are 1.3 percent of health workers.
When this device sequence an RNA virus or DNA that I don't recognize to call the health of health and, first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of plenty.
I call it the billion.
The white lines here are population.
We just passed the sea from seven billion dollars.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to empower the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion internet users.
Three billion minds never heard before the global conversation.
What do you want these people?
What will they build? What do you want to have?
And instead of an economic collapse we'll have the largest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in the global economy.
And you'll get more health thanks to the Triceratops, from a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computation in clouds will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy healthy and productive health?
How about a few voices never heard before?
What if we give them opposed to the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and can do for the first time?
What will these three billion dollars?
And if you're contributing that we can't predict it?
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams, guided by their passion with a clear target, they can do extraordinary things.
I'm going to finish sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called Foldit.
He emerged at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine structure and function.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a superconductor problem.
They've played this college teachers.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started playing it.
And it has been shown that the machinery recognition machinery is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to assume the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the bank.
We have the capital of the jitney.
And we have three billion new minds that will join us to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The death of the game.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1833.
You may believe that person penguins, but it didn't.
It actually collects fish.
And he described one of them as very common."
It was the mess.
I was caught a lot to the 1880s.
Now fish is at the Red List of the U.S.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're biased.
The filters still say they remain intact.
So what happens here?
Second story, also illustrates another concept -- the deployment of the waist.
Because I was there in 1971.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate me.
I burned a lot to the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lake was surrounded by palms, and as you can see, from a few mangroves.
There were tons of about 20 centimeters -- the black bag block.
And the fish of this thylacine was very abundant. It was very abundant.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had halved.
They were made at five inches.
They experience a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was involved in the introduction of sand fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, it started in 1960, Europe did a lot of development projects.
Fish development was supposed to impose countries that were already 100,000 fishermen to impose the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly -- he called the Mutania four.
I went out to fish in it, and we conducted studies in the south of the Middle China and most of all, in the March of Japan.
What we captured was something unstable.
We captured now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were sponsors, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny blobs on a few of the remains that are fish coral fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was thrown away.
These images are extraordinary because transitions is very quick.
In one year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom goes from being a solid coral background.
This is a dead turtle.
They didn't eat them. They downloaded them because they were dead.
We once captured a living.
I still wasn't all at all.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time you go to an area where you've never fish fish.
But it's not documented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember.
We adjust the point of parties, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this something like this.
On the axis, we have good things -- biodiversity, lots of bars, the green of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images that are received at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and exploding it forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the situation of changes.
And at the end of keeping some missing misery.
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer anymore, or are not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before extinct, is thin.
You don't miss angry animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea of big fish.
They become unconscious because we fishing.
Over time, there are few fish, but we think that's the point of parties.
And the question is: why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, questioning that it was very different.
And they will do it because evidence present in a way before it's not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some people have, like capture such and so much fish in this area cannot be used to, or usually they don't use the science scientists, because it's not scientific."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we live in industrialized societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From that enormous role that can be able to have a protected marine area.
Because with the protected marine areas, we actually recreated the past.
We recreated the past that people can't conceive because the point of particle has run and it's quite low.
That's for people who can see a marine marine area and they can benefit from the vision that causes them, which allows them to erase their point of party.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access to, like the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may probably fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago there were grey whales in Chesapeake Bay. 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the mathematicians and the tons are like "Love Avail."
And if you think about "Love, if you think about why people were touched with the movie -- not talking about the story of the Ponglad, why do we engage with pictures?
Because it evolves something that, in a sense, it has lost.
So my reform, the only one I will give, is Cameron, make "Availa II" underground.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Allas, the conversation manager of YouTube."
It's true.
So we will see why videos are made out of and how important that is.
We're all storytellers.
But today the web video makes any of us, or from our actions -- copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a sandwich.
It takes over 18 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And from those only a little bit of a percentage of it becomes viral -- it receives infinite information and computer machinery.
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, community participants and surprise.
Well, let's start here.
Beard Marsham: Oh, my gosh, my God.
Oh my God."
Wow.
Oh, wow!
KA: Last year, Beijing Pask published this video shot outside of his house at the National Park Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This chart shows the reproduction in the population of the past summer.
Beard doesn't make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Moses Mountain Beard.
I had already posted many videos of nature.
This video had been published.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimbabe.
Jimmy Kimmer published this aunt that captured the video to popularity video.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kimmer presents us and interesting things and spread them to a wider public.
Rebecca Black)  It's Fridays, Fridays. You have to start the Frees.   Everyone wants me to get the weekend, the weekend, the weekend.   You want to think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video.
"Vandan Venezuela is one of the most popular video clips of the year.
You saw it nearly 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Like the "Architect Royal Robby Robbies," this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Fridays. It's true.
And if you ask for those other peaks, they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular parents?
Well, the Tower took it, and many bloggers started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Mister State Thategon, was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on Twitter.
But the point is that a person or a group of creators are adopting a point of view and share it with a wider audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about it and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 walls of Venezuelan on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every other day.
Unlike the University of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon by spreading, or doing something new with it.
"Wanna Catari: It's a repetitive animation with a music chord.
So that's it.
This year saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that you've seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the point here is the creativity that sparked between the Internet Internet community.
There were replacements.
Somebody made an ancient version of it.
And then it became internationally.
Suddenly, it came up with a whole community of remix, which made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all be part of.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted "Rabbi three or Red Black or "Wantan Cat?"
What did you want to have written to make this situation?"
In a world where you go up with two days of video per minute -- only that very unique and unexpected can be unleashed in the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great clip of a guy who protects against the titles to cycles in New York, I admit that I don't care too much.
Casey Nashver: I was drawn to not circular for the biker, but often there are obstacles that are prevented by the biker rational.
KA: Thanks to the surprise and his humor, Casey Niana made that five million people saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth of all the new we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Beard Marsham: What does this mean?
Ohih.
KA: What does this mean?
The trends, creative communities of engagement, totally unexpected -- are characteristics of a new kind of media -- a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity defined.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Berkeley, started on YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little bit about our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media -- but define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still breaking.
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first piece -- a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a drug, a man whose life had been supported in the unique hope of oneness and freedom.
Imagine it as the communists come into Santa, facing the fact that their life had totally been in vain.
The words, for so long, is now battling it.
It was forged in silence.
He died by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that be in vain. And my lesson was to learn that the story tried to mate, but we hold it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at sunset slowing up to the sea.
My mother, May, was only 18 years old when her father died, and a contaminated marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been described to a task -- the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her to not achieve it.
And then from a four years that defies fiction, a boat slid into the sea deployed sea devil.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was periods, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother would carry a little bit of a strangler.
If you were caught first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, and it turns out on every wave and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were enthusiastic with the suitcase of men in our boat, or the engine died and couldn't catch for six hours.
But I know I know the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malawi, and the young man who collapsed and died, finished the journey was too much for him, and the first apple that I tried to, given by the men in the platform.
None of the apples.
After three months in a refugee camp, we embarked in Melbourn.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in Fortune, a class lobby, which population is comprised of immigrants.
Unlike the middle class submersibles, which existed in Fortune, in Fortune, there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the incomes of English.
My mother worked on farms, then on a line of car car line, working six days, double turn.
Still, I found time to study English and get a title on IT technology.
We were poor.
All of the dollars were all adopted, and established an extra tutoring in English and mathematicians, no matter what it should be taken, which was usually new clothing.
Two pairs of media for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the bills, because it had to last six years.
And there were very rare and painful shorts on the eyes and some gratitudes, Asians, come home."
Honey, what?
Something in me was driven.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to go."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted, but we were telling us about our day, and we heard the motions of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered sheets, all of the boat.
And my task was to be woken up until her skinness would start to wake up.
She opened up a grocery store, then I studied to be a stereotype and opened up another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry, and inflated boys and children trapped between two worlds.
They were seeking subsidies and paraplegical paraplegic.
And they were created.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, incompatible with what I was thinking about myself.
In the other, I was interested in precision lives, tragically like violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But a lot of aid received over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of a lawyer, I chose the young Australian young lady.
And I was captured from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
Tan Anne -- in addition to Fortune, was now so Lee, refugee and social activists invited to speak on sites that he had never heard names, and at home there she had never imagined.
I didn't know the protocell.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to remove the routine and the comfort of life in an inorganic submersible -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for nearly 20 years, counting on the day of each and burning asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she was attached to the boat.
The note had ever been an option.
"Let me say, "And you're not what you are."
So I talked about youth and education and deforestation to the marketing and the deforestation.
And the more frankly speaking, the more I was talking to talk about.
I met people from all walks of life, many of them doing what they loved love, living on the bottom of the possibility.
And even though I ended up my license, I realized I couldn't stay on a bag of a lawyer.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a disconnect, a new collection, new on the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's not just that it's good, it's something that will be grateful, maybe a godsend.
Because being inside it can easily mean to collapse the horizon, it can easily mean accept the pressures of your province.
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is demoralized, but not the way we fear.
Possibilities that would not have been allowed to be allowed.
There was a energy there, a unimpressive optimist, a rare mixture of humility.
So I kept my intuition.
I put a little group of people for those who the slogan can't be done was a resistant challenge.
For one year, we didn't have a center.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant of soup that we all share.
We worked at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant, and we opened up steps.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My heart again.
Three months later I had moved on, and the adventure continued.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time where the Constitucing was the social norm and the local Mandelbrot was the person that matters.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it alone.
At the age of 17, it became a conculture of a Manderbalk whose mother hit it.
No support of his husband, he caused a return to sue it and take the cause herself and much more revolutionized caused when they win.
It can't be done to be wrong.
It was in the room in a hotel in Sydney when she died, at 1,000 miles, in Melbourn.
I looked through the machine of the shower and saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to be awake.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple, and we sat around his attention.
We told stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monkey came and told us he had to close the attack.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monkey: "Why your hand is hot, and the rest of the body so cold?"
"Because you've taken your hand from the morning, he said.
"You're not sandwiched."
If there is a nerve in our family, that running through women.
Since we were and how life formed us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been frustrated.
The defeat would have been easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could want that for you?
However, I fear the privilege.
Can I give you a little bit of a life in your life, suggesting your blood in every wave -- the improvision rate of the engine, the horizontal vast that doesn't guarantee nothing?"
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them, I would do it.
Thirty Newson and also the mother of this is so today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in Random about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky sky, with the singer Muhan Ali.
We were talking about how nothing has changed.
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car, and we submitted the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when Army, the great Indian warrior, he had a seat, and he would take a bow and a stream on the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same thing with tablets and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was really challenged to me.
And every time I felt a little more technical.
I was terrified this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't take it to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not to kill it.
As a kid, my grandfather gave me his retaliative pilot of pocket.
And this technology piece of 50 years was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirates and narratives in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile cells, the luxury clock and the cameras prevent that we are.
They face our inspiration.
And so I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing her.
It illustrates books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly multi-consumption.
But what does that mean?
I'm about to launch Khy, an interactive application for iPad.
He says, "Give your fingers on every light."
And so --  -- he says, "This box belongs to -- I write my name.
And so I became a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes from me.
My inner girl is excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we get from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always passionate to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the leathers.
And they really illuminate your way in what the book remains from the book.
Another idea that fascinated me as a girl was that a whole galaxy would fit on a bag.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a pen that I drag into this magic device into this magical device.
And this opens up a map.
There are always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows up, flush and guide during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it also unfolds.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the oppositions.
We've all heard of the ones and the nights, but how many people outside of India know their Indian counterparts. Would you care?
These poor guys have been trapped on the cameras in Iraq for millennia, in an old and face book.
So we're bringing back into a contemporary child record.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been buried, attached to their PCA, they haven't gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections: on sticks, stones, judges and coaches.
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this ritual of childhood you have to go out and, in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then label it.
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a shop and says, "Oh, I saw a road."
A kid in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And it creates this sort of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taken.
Inside the variation of connection between the magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we plan to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video, and you can actually see a group of animals that appear on the beaches of the house.
At a moment, the screen.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and fold them to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are intertwined with technology and magic and technology get closer to each other.
We leverage the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and joy and child love that we feel through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many health projects fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the Robert University, was to define a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she put a little cup of coffee or tea and I asked patients, family and known -- what happens?
"How can we help it?
And we tend to think, this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or perhaps not all, but most of the health projects fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wikipedia scanner. It's a very simple thing.
It has a bar of switched and off.
Every morning I get up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 pounds.
But it's so simple, that every time I get, I send my information to Google Heathrow.
And my medical doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which it needs circular assistance or some urgency of that style but see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my Wikipedia blanket and before I get to my car, people start to talk about: Lucifer, today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people out of their chairs.
From the next week will be available.
This little block attached to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to be able to be able to take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to the control and be capitalists of their own ship, but they can also help us help health care, because of the challenges that we face, like the cost of medicine care, the doubling of demand and other issues.
To perform techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by crowdsourcing.
And one of the things that we did to share with you with a video video.
We all have navigation control in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM cars are at Machininalone.
Also where all of the gas are.
And of course, we can find fast food chain.
But where is the nearest DNA to help this patient?
We said, but nobody knows.
Nobody knew where to get the DEDT saves life right now.
What we did was we made crowdsourcing in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to see the audience "When you see a DARPA, please send it, tell us where, and when it's open, because sometimes open up in or other ones are closed.
And over 10,000 DASA was already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We create an application for Lawrence, augmented reality, to find these DARPA.
And every time you're in the city of March and someone collapses, you can use your iPhone and you can use your iPhone cell phone to find the nearest DNA -- which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not only like DNA 4, which is the name of the product, but also as DNA.
And we wanted to start it globally.
We're looking at all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work and act as a center for the DARPA computer worldwide.
Every time you're on vacation and someone collapses, it can be a patient or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us to validate these DARPA.
They could be a message of message or people, for example, to see if the DARPA is still in their place.
Please take care of this and not only improve the health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my picture.
Or is it phone?
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest for photography. I woke up with my first digital camera at 15.
She was mixed with my previous passion, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a picture with a camera the process ends up when you press the paper.
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start pressing the paper.
Pictures like this: a construction on a very crowded road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite it, it keeps a level of reality.
Or pictures like these -- dark and colorful at once, but with the common goal to keep the level of law.
And when I say realistic say philosopher.
Because, of course, it's not something I can capture but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as a photograph.
Pictures where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capturing an idea to catch a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them seem real?
Are they detailed or color?
Does it intervene light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes illusion is the perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a two-dimensional surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfect objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that looks 3D, as if it exists.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we send the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining photography.
It's really going to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like a picture of the fact that I think are those that we don't even think about, the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But by combining pictures is very important to consider it, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures combined to have the same kind of light.
And these two images come up with these requirements, they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to differentiate the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect meeting.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
I could think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is manipulated.
But this picture is totally comprised by photographs of different places.
In personal I think it's easier to create a place than finding it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter, I knew I had several months to plan it, to find the different location for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The costs are from a different location.
The undersea part was captured in a piece of rock.
And yes, I even made the house from the top of the island to look cooler.
So to achieve a realistic outcome I think it needs planning.
It's always a shot, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well thinking.
If you make a good job when you take the pictures, the outcome can be very beautiful and very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please may.
It's a diagram that I took from a folder.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of ROVCArt microseconds versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like many other people that we tend to see, is sort of a short line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
Talk about systems with symbols with symbols is something new.
Here's something bizarre here.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
It would need more intense because writing about paper.
Why do we record?
The answer is that if I draw them in a normal curves where we say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to draw, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if I graduate, for example, some other technology, like transportation in a symbolic curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology would advance as fast as the microscopes, last morning we could take a cab and be in Tokyo.
But it doesn't go to that pace.
There are no precedent in the history of the technology development of a feedback growth that every few years of magnitude orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these exponential curves -- we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It will happen one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical self like this until it gets something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm an optimist, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we're in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask yourself, is: What is that new way that the world is adopting the world?
What new state is the world heading?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're embedded in it.
I remember the future occurred in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has gone on, year after my life.
But I think it's because something is happening.
It's a transformation, and we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than expressing what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that we experience with.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we came back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great star rock with many chemicals flowing around them.
If we look at the way we organize those chemicals, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside, and so the droplets grew up.
And they started to split.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms.
But those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a clear range of chemicals.
And every time they separated, they had an unequal distribution of chemicals that they continue.
So every drop was a little differently.
In fact, the droplets that sort of differentiate to be better at the time of incorporating the chemical chemicals -- they grew up more, they were getting more chemicals and they divide more.
They usually lived longer, they were more related.
It was a form of life, a chemical life, very simple, but things got interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well these droplets learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to replicate.
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since they evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same code system.
In fact, every being alive is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun -- now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 microns of white dust trying to hide people from security security.
But it -- I took this code -- and I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this snippet of DNA and amplified it to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot for all the speakers -- in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If an eBay would have put it into a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step.
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells were happy another billion years.
But then there was another great step in which things were really different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information by forming these cells of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, they evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin, and they took them back to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistance to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that were formed that in a way, they were together, and they set up a synergy.
So they survive or fail together, and that is that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community, they were getting closer and they were favorable for evolution.
And the point of inflection occurred when these communities came so much that, in fact, came together and decided to write the whole recipe of the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage of interesting for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have multicellular communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we are a multi-consumption community.
We have a lot of cells that are no longer acting alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the case of muscles, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
These are starting to absorb information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than processing information in community.
It's the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they began to specialize within the community being responsible to record, understanding and transferring information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as individuals, learning was confined to the length of an organism and not the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat certain fruit, because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen.
So the fact that the nervous system built those data structures to accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time needed to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a vague idea, in the head.
I'm here sitting by emitting some groups and hopefully building a similar idea, vagina and confusion, in their heads that hold certain analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated, we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as an organism.
In fact, as a human, we've started doing abstractions.
Now we spend similar to the multicellular organisms, we abstract our methods of record, present and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The telegraph, the informal, the video tape, the CDC, etc. These are specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary example of T that produced some evolution with the Convinction program, to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scale of time again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years each.
The next step, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following language, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the following ones, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is refugee -- I guess that collaboration is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes faster, faster.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is feedback.
But I earn my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design them would not be possible without recent hackers.
But now design objects that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that it does every transistor in that connection machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of Thinkie Malekians, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that before you couldn't get, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes the methods we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions at random.
Can you run these kinds of instructions of instructions at random, run all those programs, and take those who are closer to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could put two numbers in the right order.
And I said, "Computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task better?
We set up those and eliminate the rest.
And now we now reproduce those who best ordered the numbers.
And we go back to reproduce them by following a process of analog reconstruction to sex."
Let's take two programs, which bring children, that exchange suburbs, and that kids inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the process."
California again.
It introduces some mutations.
And he tries again and reproduce another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that lead numbers in absolutely perfect way.
In fact, it's much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are darkly programs, strangely.
But they get the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they achieve the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I once went into a 747 with Margaret Minnesota, and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "This plane has hundreds of thousands of particles that work together to offer a safe flight. Don't make you feel a wide?"
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering produces.
But we don't understand all the options that we are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, and so we can execute these programs much faster.
I mean, it's fertile.
The thing goes faster and faster, and so I think it seems so hard.
Because all of these technologies are feedback.
We're catching up.
And we're at an analog moment to the single-cell organisms when they became multi-consumption.
We are the amounts and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the point of inflation.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think stop here before I get eliminated.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been spending enough time to allow me to get part of my fake presence on that.
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We are near the end, the World Service approach it.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of surprising statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about going to "Represent the Rules," talk about statistics and to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them, and I hope many of you know it.
It's called the average average.
And we talk about 300 of a battery that is balanced.
That means that the baby baseball effectively, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the game field without being caught, and that anyone who tries to launch it to the first base -- don't get in time, and the second base will be saved.
Three thousand thousands.
You know what they call a 300 ball in the Great Lights?
Well, really, well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a 400-year-old baseball bat?
By the way, that's someone who is 10 bags, it turns out four.
Legonicity -- like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the largest league of Bishover to executed more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's try this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have appears and they are derived to a surgeon who has a 400 percent record in appealers.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place left and a loved self has two heart arteries and their family doctor who serves it to a cardiologist whose record in angiogenesis is 200 dollars.
But you know what?
She's getting this year.
And they have been 257.
This isn't working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think that should be the average of a heart surgeon or a prisoner, a nurse or a collecting obstacle?
1,000, very good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the acts of a good surgeon -- a doctor or a paradigm.
What we do, though, is to send the world to the world, and I include, with the standards of being perfect.
That they never, they make a mistake and be able to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I absorbed when I was in medical school.
I was a computer observatory.
Once a time, a fellow in the high school said that Brian Gold studied to a blood test.
Like that.
I studied in my little devil, in the residence of the CEO of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
In my kind of anatomy class, I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artifact that goes out of the art, the differentiated difference and not the usual difference.
And I even knew the difference diagnosis about how to clarify kidney activists.
And as much as it was accumulating more and more knowledge.
And I was really fine, I graduated with hormones.
And from the school of medicine with the impression that if I memorized everything, then I would know everything else, or the most likely, close to everything, because this is so improvising me from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Dr. Drug.
I was a resident at a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the Drug lady to emergency services where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to cardiology service.
And when you first applied to a cardiologist, you hit me to attend that patient.
And to report the boss of residents.
When I saw Dr. Drug, I was dropping.
I heard a remarkable sound.
And when I found it, I heard a string sound on both sides of it, which was telling me a compelling heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops running, and instead of pumping blood forward, blood goes to the lungs -- these are blood, and therefore there's difficulty to breathe out.
And it wasn't difficult to diagnosis.
I did it and I started working on the treatment I would give him.
He gave him aspiration and medicine to alleviate pressure in her heart.
He gave him digital pulses, pulses of water, so he could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first mistake I sent her back home.
Actually, I made two more errors.
He sent her to her house without talking to the boss of residents.
I didn't pick up the phone and did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and consume it with him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to give you a complementary information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would require constant attention.
Perhaps I wanted to be so successful and able to assume responsibility, that I could take care of my patients without even counting my boss.
The second mistake I ate was worse.
When I send her back home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner who said, "Goldbook, it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure, he asked the nurse to take care of the Dr. Drug: "Do you think it's okay if you go home?
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yeah, I think I'll be okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high, and the ambulance along with the guards took her back home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad presence in the stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I started to leave the hospital and walked into the parking room where my car was my car, and I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency services on the road.
And there another nurse, not the one who took care of the Drug lady before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors.
Other specialists also fear it, but there's a particular in emergency and it's that we see the patients fluxterly.
The three words is: Do you remember you?
"Do you remember the patient who sent your home?"
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"Well, she came back with the same tone tone.
She went fine.
But I went back and on the side of death.
At an hour of having come to her house, after I gave her the high, he suffered a collapse and her family called 9/11 -- the paradigms brought it to emergency with a 50-year-old arterial pressure pressure, which means a severe shock.
I barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff deploy all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise the arterial pressure.
And they put an artificial response.
I was concentrated and rocked up to the core.
It had a mix of sentiments because after the stabilize was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope to recover.
And in the two or three days afterward, it was obvious that I would never wake up.
It had a brilliant cerebral damage.
The family came together.
And within eight days, they signed up to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they were left to go. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. Head, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the following weeks later, I screamed for it, and I experienced for the first time the male marker that exists in our medical culture and I felt just insulated, isolated, without feeling that healthy embarrassment because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the countries and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teach.
The malignant shame that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside within.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my boss, he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I suspended things and made sure that they wouldn't give me to me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my family? Why did it send her to his house?
And in my worst moments, why did I make an mistake?
Why did I choose medicine?
Little by little that feeling was disappearing.
And I began to feel better.
And in a cloud day, it opened up the sky, and finally the sun came out, and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I used the efforts to be perfect to make no more errors, I would make those voices to sew those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, it was in the emergency department in a hospital hospital in the north of Toronto, and I received a 25 year-old man with a pain in the barrier.
I was very busy.
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her house, I was a little colored.
He wrote penicillin and sent him back home.
But as he goes to the door he kept pointing his hair.
Two days later, when I came to my graduate change, my boss asked me to talk to me excellent in his office.
And then the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the harvest?
Well, he came back and didn't have a strange profile.
It had a potentially fatal condition called Egyptians.
You can Google it in Google -- it's an infection, not from the barrier, but from the upper air stem, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He was lucky, luckily, he failed.
He reads antibiotic anti-providers and recover the few days.
And through the same period of embarrassment and replacements, then he saved me and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Twice. Twice.
And it's a great effort. Especially to work on a hospital, because you have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a description.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They ordered a root radio, but a colleague who was checking the patient perceived certain sensitivity on the bottom right and called the surgeon.
The other patient was very different.
I read liquid to retire and asked my colleague to check it.
You check it up and see some sensitivity on the bottom right quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and worked well.
But every case was attracted, I was blown down.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a puzzle.
The most significant has been over the last five years.
Just shaming and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't release myself and talk about my mistakes -- if I can't find the voice that tells me what happens to me, how can I share this with my colleagues.
How do I show you this to don't get the same mistakes?
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When's the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but don't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a traffic in my hospital took the wrong leg, believe me would have difficulty to look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions: the ones that make mistakes and the ones that can't sleep and the ones that have properties and those who have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as antibody who start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we avail from medicine to people who make mistakes, we'll get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years and depression of medical journalism -- I've done a personal study of bad medical prostheses and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first paper I wrote for the Star Tower, "White Coke, Blake Coach, Black Coast," Black Art."
And what I learned is that mistakes are present.
We worked in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 in the hospital are wrong, or the failure is not right -- in a system where hospitals are increasingly more and more numerous and more numerous and more numerous -- causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24 million Canadian medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's based on crude subsidies, because we're not destroying the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multipled every two or three years, and we don't get involved.
The privacy of the dream invaded everything.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest. It comes along with bright eyes and at alien to alcohol, and suddenly my story is thrown out of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot -- I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. Don't tell their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all the professionals susceptible to mistake, well, no one will be left.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their more serious cases?
In my program, "Lesterland blah art, black art, it's a question to say, "This is my worst mistake -- I would say to everybody, from the paradigms to the boss of heart surgery -- "This is my worst mistake, blah blah blah blah blah -- "What are your mistakes?" And it would run the microphone to them.
And their students would stop, they would go down, they would turn out the head and they would drag out and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to say, "Look, don't get the same mistake wrong.
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a redemical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The uninformed physician is human, you know, human beings, accepts it, and it doesn't get proud of their mistakes, but it will be striving to learn from what happened to teach others.
Compare their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
I set out the mistakes of other people not with intention to catch them, but in a love way and support for everyone to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans are directing the system, and when this happens, they get mistakes from time in time.
My name is Brian Gold.
I'm a redesigned doctor.
I'm human, I make mistakes.
And I'm really excited about learning something that can convey others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions do we take one day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey to over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to choose an American American. It's about 70 a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of emergency scientists.
Researchers were recorded by the different tasks and the time they used to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that in average, they have 133 jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of mining.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of his time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the hours?
How do you measure the way that you handle those decisions?
Today I want to talk today about one of the biggest problems today today, choose to choose for options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive.
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear the problem of the property of the opposition?
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, it was reminded this very tall, very tall, at least at least at least at least at least at least at least at least in that time it was very sophisticated.
It's called Drakes.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar, over 500 different kinds of 500 different ships and vegetables and about 25 of the workforce, and this was when we had water water.
I loved going to that tent, but I just asked myself, "Why would I never buy it?
This is the steel of the olive oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in the sealed box that came from militarized trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, "Is this strategy to offer all these options?"
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with his camera.
We decided to make a little experiment with the memories.
She's hanging out.
They had 84 different classes.
We installed a set of setting, right to the entrance of the tent.
We put out there signed out of six tastes, or from 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop testing the melody?
More people stopped when there were 24 percent, 60 percent, that when there were only six percent, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a melody.
Here we find the opposite effect.
What stopped when there was 24 -- only three percent came to buy a metal.
What they stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy membrane if they found six -- that if they found 24 percent.
Well, to decide that we don't buy that we buy that we buy it to us -- at least it's good for us to preserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of the supply of choices affects us in traditional decisions.
We decided not to decide even when this is not convinced.
Now the theme of the day, the financial saving.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with Gord Hunter, Em and Erik Kamen, where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 600 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of forces available on savings planners for retirement, the 404 program -- deployed people to save for the future.
And we found there was really a correlation.
We had 656 plans that ranged from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the future number was taken, there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two fund, the rate rate was 70 percent or more, not as much as it would like.
And on the plans that were offering about 60 fund, the rate rate went down to the 60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those of you who decided to participate, the greater the number of options, the more people were inclined to avoid the actions or the investment funds.
There were more choices, they were more willing to invest in the financial fairy account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would recommend to optimize the financial financial well-being.
In the past decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they get the decision, that apply even when this goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions in finance, and in the health.
They're more likely to pick up less satisfying things, even though they get better at them.
The main reason is that we get to look at that giant variety of mass, mosquito, clothing and melody, but we are not able to do the calculations to share, contract and choose that amazing display.
Today I want to propose to you four simple techniques that we have tried to, in one way or another, in different research, so that they can train into their business.
The first is, Curtain.
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, "Look.
They worry about losing space in the ancestor.
But actually, what we're seeing increasingly is that if you decide to cut, to get rid of extra choices, there will be an increase in the winds, down the costs, will have a better experience in choice.
When Procase & Gamble went from 26 different types of Head & Shackan to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Goldman Catari compete has eliminated the products for cats of cats that are less sold, they increased the users in 787, by two causes, bigger selling and fewer costs.
You know that supermarket superstrings are offering 45,000 products.
In a shop of Walmart.
But the ninth largest line in the world today is Aldium and offer only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce on the tin.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to manage the choices is the planet of David Labraya, the Harvard show.
All the employees in Harvard are automatically engaged to a life insurance fund.
They really want to choose, they offer 20 fund, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to cut down.
These are all important options."
The first thing I do is ask the employees: "Tell me the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't tell you, you won't be able to do your clients."
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Garden.
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience with everything paid to the most beautiful road.
Here, a description.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give a applause if you're ready to take the Gold Stress.
(Clicks are appropriate.
Aren't it?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think it really reached more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, and in the second round, but I can turn to say that you thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of opposition of choices, which is Corporation.
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very much, very counterintuitive.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses credit cards or credit that when it uses effective use?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Sherman Benjamin and Alexander Prevast, about personal R&D people who worked at INTUV. These people were in a meeting where they were being claimed to a 404 plan.
That meeting, we preserved exactly how we were used to, we did a little warning.
What we added was that we asked the staff to think about positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this mountain there was an increase in the 20 percent of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to place on their savings bills, from four percent.
The third technique is Classic.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that at the Wenders of the northern room, the exhibition of magazines can contain from 13 different types to 664.
But, you know?
Because the fallacy indicates me how to tell them.
These are two jewelry.
One is called "Japanese and the other, Sking."
If you think the one on the left is Switzerland and the one on the right is Jason, they give a palm on it.
(Audience: Well, there are some applause.
If you think that the one on the left is Jason and the one on the right is Swiss, they give a stick.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's correct.
The one on the left is Jason and the one on the right is Swimmer. But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something that you pick, not to define them.
You often see this problem with those enormous final lists.
Anyone who are informing?
My fourth category: Condemining complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a well-known decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German manure manufacturer.
You have to make 60 decisions, to assemble the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one.
Color outside. I have 56 possibilities.
Motor, box of change, four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order that the decisions emerge.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, to a few boxes, four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four boxes, to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to look at.
How many of you are.
If you have a lot of acceptance in every decision, this indicates that you're overwhelmed, or it is, we're losing them.
We found that those who are going from a lot of choices to a few options, provide the button, and again, and another more.
We miss them.
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order that you present information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to choose.
Although choosing the box of changes don't say anything about the preferences of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the Internet, in all ways we prepare to choose to choice.
We get excited about a product that we're building that now has more hooks to the process.
To summarize it.
I've talked about four techniques.
All these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the alternatives or better, for you, to use them in their issues or for people who are going to be.
That is that I think the key to get the best of an election is being careful by choosing.
And the more careful we are in our better choices will be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in communist Eastern Germany, if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to register a little text sheet, written with the machine.
And this for government to track the origin of text.
If they came up with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we didn't realize that someone could do this, a lot of it would limit the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow pictures on every page that are tracking a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the net.
If we look at what happens in the world online, we can grab the attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
There are criminals.
Like Mr. Dimitri Gold of the city of Kiva, in Ukraine.
The mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberspaces to earn a lot of money, intentional quantities.
There are really many cases of millions online, multi-consumption, who made money with their attacks.
This is Valentine's Stature, from Twitter, Ethiopia.
This is Alfred Gonza.
This is Stephen Water.
This is Berner Sunday.
These are Matthew Anderson, Tahrir Alpha etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal trees to steal money from our own, when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our valentines when we buy a computer computer.
The secret service in the United States, two months ago, froze the Swiss account of this guy, Sam Jay, and this account was 14 million dollars when it was frozen up.
The Mr. James is still disconnected.
And I say today is more likely than any of us is victims of a cyber than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad in worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we observe today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions -- they motivate the opinions -- they motivate laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have downloaded over the last 12 months, occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks: criminals who do it for money, the hackers like Anonymous, who do it to protect and the last group are the national states that are attacking them.
And then we see cases like Dignitory.
That's a good example of government attacks against their own citizens.
Dignity is a certificate authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
Declare the last fall, because of a scar.
They staged the safety of the site and they played a cyber.
Last week, in a meeting with representations of Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people because of the attack to Denmark.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die?
Dignity is a critical authority.
They sell certificates.
Why do you serve the certificates?
Well, you need if you have a website with stereotypes, services encrypted SETI, services like Golia.
Except to intercept an alien certified authority.
And they eliminate caregivers.
And in the case of Dignitory happened exactly that.
And what about the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt.
Well, in Egypt, the protesters took the sound of the police secret Egyptians in 2011, and during the back of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this folder called "The USA-down.
And within that folder there were notes from a company in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept large-scale communications.
He had sold this tool for 8,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The headquarters of the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to the totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the Treasure Steven School, a tree used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is interviewed.
But today goes beyond.
It embeds the Internet connection.
They will use even tools like the Treason School to infect our computer with a tree to allow them to see all the communications, and listen online online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like this, the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm a honest citizen.
Why worry?
I have nothing to hide.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's playing privacy.
Privacy doesn't melt.
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So while we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right we have to do today will be forever.
Are we going to trust any future government, in an administration, that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows.
The National National Park doesn't have fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like brands migrate from the park.
And predators, like lions follow, and this is what they do.
They kill our winners.
This is one of those who killed at night, and as soon as we woke up in the morning and found it dead and found it very bad because it was the only towel we had.
My community, the masses, we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to show them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up hating a lot to lions.
They die them are warriors, they protect our community and livestock and they're also mad with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A kid in my community, from six at nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions would give them fear.
But I realized that actually, this doesn't serve, because even helped the lions to see the star of far.
I didn't yield. I continued.
A second idea was to use a scarses.
She was trying to deceive the lions to believe it was near the stage.
But the lions are really intelligent.  They came the first day, and they saw the scandals, and they went back and left, but the second day, they went back and said, "This thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they hop and kill animals.
So one night I was walking around the shelf with an oven, and that day, lions didn't come in.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light to move.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to learn and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
I made everything.
As you can see, the solar panel takes the battery and the battery supply the electricity to the little indigenous box.
And the inhibitory box makes lights detail.
As you can see, the lightbulb goes outside, because that's where the lions come from.
And that's how lions see it when they come at night.
The lights explode and send the lions to think that I'm walking through the stage, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them up. You can see the fund, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to scare other predators like helples, legacy, and it's also used for stamping elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention -- I was fortunate to get a fellowship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brooklyn International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping bring funding and concentration.
I even led my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to put them.
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the sand of the savanna, speaking the cows.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come to the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an animation and a pilot engineer.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cow of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
Allah wing. What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard Turn: Yeah.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on your list?
LT: My next invention is -- I want to make an electric fence -- CA: A electric close?
LT: I know you invented the electric closes, but I want to make mine.
CA: Have you tried it once, right? And you -- LT: I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a candler.  CA: At the foot of the probe. Richard Turn, you're huge.
We're going to stick on every step that you know, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No China's China.
And I felt very proud of it.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim Snowbouka, but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea is the enemy.
Though sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I'd spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public exercise.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my brother.
That said, "When you read this, the five family members will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're lying together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
I was very high.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train season, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody would help them, because they were very worried about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine, the North Korea in the middle of the 1990s.
At the end of a million North Koreans died during hunger, and just a few of them survive eating pastor, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more often the energy cuts -- all around me was completely to dark at night except by the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the Amartma River, which serves from the North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very attached to certain points, allowing North to cross a second.
But many die.
Sometimes I see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with distant people.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to come back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be.
But soon I learned that it's not just hard, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be replicated to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese cops and was interested in police station.
Somebody had been accused by being north, so they tested my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and supported.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the interrogation.
And they left me to go. It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China are looking for asylum in foreign embryos.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese cops and depressions.
These women had a lot of luck.
Though they had captured them, they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans weren't so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and depressed to North Korea, where they're tortured or candidated or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, the whole world can be embedded in an instant.
That's why, after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to risk myself going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
I was sitting in South Korea was a challenge much greater than I anticipated.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a great gap between North and South South.
We're all citizens, but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of division.
Even through an identity crisis.
Am I a solerly or a North America?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with pride myself.
Though I adapt to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam to university.
Just when I started conforming my new life, I received an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities would intercept some money that sent my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the outside.
They had to rush away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, in a way, for more than 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in bus took a week, and almost we were caught several times.
Once time, our bus was stopped and adopted by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identity of everyone. And he started asking questions questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I was supplying my foot and told him that they were deaf people who were collapsing.
I looked at myself, but luckily, I thought.
We did all the way to the border of Louis.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards.
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border illegal.
After paying crutches and sovereignts, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and increased again in Lawson capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did all of my family to liberate my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was returned to the short distance of the South Korean bow.
I was going to come between the immigration of immigration and police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribe or fluid.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asking, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubling, the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two nuts and bring them out of prison.
I was grateful with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why me?"
"I'm not helping, he said.
"I'm helping the north people."
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The ammonia unknown symbolizes a new hope for me and for the North Korea when we needed it.
And it showed me that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the North Korea needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving its freedom is only half the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families, and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language, practice practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to live with family and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very lucky, I have received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North that is growing around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Central Center.
This is Centre Street -- sounds of light, fast food, banjo land.
So the planners in the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center to represent something else, so they changed the South Los Angeles, as though this will fix what's wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South --  Stores of Line, rapid food, banjord.
Like 265, millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to carry more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, Beverly Hillis -- that's about 15 kilometers away.
I tired to see that this happens.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to food, and if every time you get out of house you see the harmful effects that the current food system has in your neighbor?
I see chairs.
I see centers of disposabilities like Starbucks.
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I already stopped driving 45 minutes away and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planted a food forest in front of my house.
In a soap of land we call a danger.
It's 45 feet three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I get to win, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
That's how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Grounds, we put together and start to plant our food forest forest trees, you know, nine full vegetables.
What we do, we are sort of a group paid for advertisers from all the procedures, all of the city and completely volunteers, and everything we do is free.
And the courtyard, he was beautiful.
Then someone complained to.
The city came up to me on top of me and actually gave me a catheter saying that I had to remove my yard, the catastrophic made a judgment order.
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order for planting food in a piece of land that no one matters?  So he was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Louve, and he talked to the cop and one of the Kosovo Grounds, who put a petition in Changing, with 900 signatures -- we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My concept even called to say that they were going out and loved what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more ballast land.
It has 18 miles of ball land.
That equals 20 Parks Central Parks.
That's enough space to plant 725 million plants.
Why don't it look like this?
Growing a plant will give about a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar of steam will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my homeland, when I tell people, grow your own food.
Growing your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Central Center.
I grew up there. I raised my kids there.
I refuse to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufactured for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, which is sticking walls, I remember soils, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my performance of that canvas.
You'd be surprised.
You just can't imagine how astonishing a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness of how my garden became a tool of education, the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised.
The garden is the most therapeutic act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a ground.
Also, they get fat.
I remember one occasion, who came to a mother and her daughter, and they were like the 18th 17 of the night and they were in my yard, and I went out and looked very low.
I, well, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, they don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Win, don't you fear people will steal your food?
I say, "My God, I don't have a fear of going to steal you."
That's on the road.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at your time, I want you to take your health."
There was another occasion where I put a garden into a refugee shelter.
They were these guys who helped me to download the truck.
It was fabulous. I shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so just for a moment.
So President Grounds has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and participate, all in voluntary plan.
If kids grow up, kids will eat color.
If you grow tomatoes -- you'll eat tomatoes --  But if none of it is taught, if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, you eat blind to blind you in front of it.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught -- I see color kids who are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the garden, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are charged from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you get the next George Washington Carnegie.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my planets, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole frame, where people can share food in the same picture.
I want to bring containers and turn them into healthy care.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free stuff, because fat is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to support it.
What I'm talking about is to get people to work, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor to grow their own food, opening market markets.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become electronics, winners, gardens of gardens.
We have to change the script of what a gas is.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gas.
Who manages to take your palm right?
That is her choice.
In sum if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your palette so that we can plant something.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Sound sounds)  (Clip ministicks."  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of steam, and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
They can have a lot of water in the scarver that sales.
And especially if you're lying on your bike and these cars pass up, that's not very nice.
Also, the scar can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we built roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we wanted a silent road.
The solution for that is to make porn roads.
The purple stroke, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pulses and water can go through it, so the rainwater will flow down and have a road that it's easy to drive, and they won't strike water again.
Noise will also disappear.
Because it's very heavy, the whole noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has devastations, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can disappear.
What is it? You see that on this road the stones of the surface goes out.
First of all, then several more and more and more, and so on, you know, I'm not going to do that.  But they can give her parasites, and they won't be happy with it.
And finally, it can also lead to more and more harmful.
Sometimes they can create bugs.
Oh, it's ready.
Bachans, of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can see really how damage appears in this material.
It's a porous, as I said, so it only has a little amount of advertiser between rocks.
Because of the intellect, to the light of Velder, to the oxytocin, this adrenaline, this baby, the glue between the rights, will be embroided, and if you get it down, you're going to become microprocessors, and you're separated from adaptations.
So if you drive on the road, you will get the advertisers -- as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of automatic materials.
If we can make this material be taken, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use steel lake, from that to clean sandwiches, and we can cut the steel frog in very small bits and we can mix those little bits with the battery.
So we have a lot of latencies with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- a computer machine.
The industry can heat, especially steel, is very good at it.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the button, the button will flow through these microbes and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a mountain of microbes, because I can't bring the big driver machine here onstage.
The mountain of microbes is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out right now.
I said that we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat for samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try."
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters from the Amazon author, where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road, and we test them in the lab.
We did aging the sample, we put a lot of burden on them, we would review them back with our manufacturing machine and we repair them, and we went back to test them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to close, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, incorporating these fibers, using these fibers, using the energy energy to actually increase the life of the road, even can double the life of the road, can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity.
We still have the display here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before I can show you how the repair act.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning in my house in my house.
My father was listening to CBS News, in her little gray radius.
He had a great smile in her face that was unusual in those times, because news is usually depressed.
"The Taliban was struggled, screamed my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school."
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came out of Afghanistan and made illegal.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a kid to escort my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could actually educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in the market bags to seem like we were shopping.
School was in a house, over 100 of us abbreviated in a little room.
It was nice in winter, but extremely hot.
We all knew we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally, the school was closed for a week, because the Taliban.
We always wondered what they knew from us.
Were they tracking us?
Did you know where we live?
We were amateur, but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the girls a test.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total infrastructure of a remote province of Afghanistan, insisted in her daughter, my mother went to school, and therefore her father was replaced.
But my mother raised a master's degree.
This is her.
It will go back two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all her family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters in spite of the Taliban, despite risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not to educate his children.
During the years, I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, "Well, figure, daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can force your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So don't you want to continue?"
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the balloon, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud of graduating at Microsoft College here.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was exiled from her home for the courage to educate his daughters -- was one of the first ones to fight.
He doesn't just get out of my university title, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who carry it down on the streets of Kabul Street.
My family believed in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 100, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOPA, the first and perhaps the only private school in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like my own, are advocating for them, to weigh and even in front of a default opposition.
Like Ahmeda. It's not his true name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter was walking from SETI to her village, and literally they escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you're the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending his daughter to school, you would go back to it.
"Give me now, if you will, he said, "I'm not going to give the future of my daughter for your old and shocked ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and this is something that's often forgotten in the West is that behind most of us who are trading, there's a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, it's often the first compelling interpreters of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school, they count in hundreds -- remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear these changes don't last long after the retina of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who advocate for them, that animals, I see a promising future and a lasting shift.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibility, and every day, the SOL girls remind me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the expedition: "Hei, resist Gaddafi.
But you never become a revolutionary style.
It's almost two years since the light revolution inspired by the waves of mass mobilizing as much of the Tunisian revolution as the Egyptian revolution.
A forces with many other lips, inside and outside the country to call one day of face and start a revolution against Garden the Big Bronch regime.
And we did it. It was a great revolutionary.
Women and men were liberating young books were in the spacecraft, experimenting the decline of the regime, carrying leatherbacks of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a value to explore the brutal dictator of Gaddanard.
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the Far East to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses of about 50,000 dead deaths, we managed to liberate our country and defeat the toros.
However, Gaddafi left a heavy sheet, a legacy of tripple, corruption and alternative guns.
For four decades, the Bird regime of Gaddafi, destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure in the wild.
And aware of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved a lot of other women, to rebuild the civilian civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and fair towards democracy and national reconciliation.
It was about 200 organizations in Benjamin and immediately after the decline of Gaddafi, about 300 in Tristale.
After a period of 13 years of exile -- I went back to Libya and with a unique encounter, I began to organize workshops about developing capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the platform of Women Library for peace, a movement of women, leaders, of very diverse orientation, to advocate for the socioeconomic autonomy of women and for our right to participate in building democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the present period, an environment that was becoming more and more polarized, which is made from the fancy policies and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a 175 percent of the National Congress in the first 20 years.
But gradually enough, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were disappearing, every day, we found news news news.
One day, we woke up with the news of ancient mosques and subjects submitted.
Another day, he was threatened with the news of the American ambassador and the consultation attack.
Another day, we woke up with the news of the airplane of the army.
And every day, every day, we wake up with the government of the military and its continued rape of human rights of pressures and its lack of respect of law.
Our society, made by a revolutionary mindset, is polioled more, and it has drifted away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intolerance, the exclusion and the vegetation became aware of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to inspire them with our story of the success of the "clear Lister and the election.
I'm here today to argue that we, as a nation, we chose bad choice, we make the wrong decision.
We don't miss well.
Because the choices don't bring peace, stability and security to Libya.
The main list and the alternative between candidate and candidate caused peace and national concentration?
No, they didn't.
What happened?
Why our society is still polarized and mastered with fancy policies and exclusions, both men like women?"
Perhaps what it missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion and mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election, which only reinforce the polarization and the divine.
Our nation needs the quantitative representation of the most than need the numerical representation and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discovery, which is not only honest but also putting the misery instead of the venom, the collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by war, needs desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy to try and interdependence between female and male perspectives.
That's the real screen.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in socioeconomic form.
According to a coastal of the Koran "Salvage -- peace -- "is the word of the God Mirox, "Listen, compassion."
At the same time, the word "Ragell, which is known in all the Arabian traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word "Rape -- symbolically synchronizing the feminine and material, which is going to embrace all the humanity that men and women -- that all tribes and women -- that all tribes and women have been eating.
And so just like the uterus completely covers the embryo, which grows in, the divine matrix of compassion is the whole existence.
So it tells us -- "My member shoots all the things."
This is how it tells us -- "My Merchuetonoker prevents my garden."
That all of them are given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about an intimidating question, which has an equally inspiring answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody is doing -- why is she left?
Why would someone stay with a man who passes it?
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no life geek.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I just met Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in Seventy magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green card American Expresses, and he had a very large secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I created my twin soul, pointed me off to the head with a track, carrying out with ball balls attached.
The man, the man loved more than anybody in this world, put a pistol in my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of lottery love, a psychological trap -- a psychological trap.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survival of domestic violence.
I'm bound in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at March from the White Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the list of Fortune" 500," between them John & Johnson, Leo Burner and The Washington Post.
I carry almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black book and driving a mining Hong Odyaso.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all faiths.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Exactly.
Over 85 percent of the malaries are men, and domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships, interdependent and long duration, or said another way, in families, the last place where we want or hope to find violence, which is why the domestic abuse is so disappointing.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who caught him, and in fact I was a very typical victim, because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, boys and abusive husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rainy night from January.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York, and he started floating with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he also had just license from a university of the Ivan Lebanon and worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed a kid in the field.
I had big electrons like apple, and a radio bolt wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that Concord did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the country.
He did it mostly at the beginning putting me on a pedestal.
We started to go out and loved everything from me -- that he was ready -- that he had gone to Harvard -- that he had a passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
He believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was so that the license in that prestigious school and the work on Wall Street and her brilliant future had so much relevance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to sequence and make the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and quit the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifices for your couple, so I accepted, left my work and Cyrus and I left Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a lot of love, which was coming up with heads in a physical trap, financial and psychological carefully prepared psychologist.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how she reacts it.
And this is where they come into scene these tracks.
As soon as we move to New England, you know, that place where I was supposed to know that Cyrus had to feel so sure bought three sheets.
One had in the court of the car.
The other one was lying under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those candles because of the trauma that lived from a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those things were actually a message for me, and even though I had never raised my hand, my life was seriously serious -- every minute of every day.
The first physicist attack of Congo happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and still had the shirt.
Five days later, when the 10 monkeys in my neck had disappeared, I put my mother suit from my mother and married him.
Even though he had happened, I was sure that we would live happily forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me to do a lot of it.
And I was very, very detached.
It just felt very grandmothered by the wedding and the fact to form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident and never made me hurt.
I spent twice more in our honey moon.
The first time I was driving down to a secret beach and he lost me, and he gave me so strong in his head that I rotated several times against the car window.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon and surfing through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
Congo continued to give me one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is victims of domestic violence or excellence at some point in their lives, and the Centers of Energy Control reports that every year 15 million children are malers, 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I stand?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly attractive man, and it was the only person in the world that could help Cyrus to face their devils.
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you just get down?
Why not? I could have gone at any time.
To me this is the saddest question and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you ignore -- is incredibly dangerous to abandon a maleram.
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill it.
Over 70 percent of the mass in the case of domestic violence, they happen after the victim has begun to end up to the relationship after landing, because then the abalone has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent account, even after the abused has gone back to marriage, denial resources of financial resources, and manipulation of the family system to terrify the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time without the man who would beat their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go on, because of one last sign I saw my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, he would have killed me if she had allowed me if she had allowed me if she had allowed me if she had been allowed if he had been allowed if she had been allowed if he had been allowed if she had been allowed if she had been allowed if she had been allowed if she had been allowed if
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, the police, to my neighbor, to my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to stereotypes victims as spectacular headlines, self-destructive women, good days.
The question, "Why is it left?"
For some people is a way to say "The Sun is "stopped by stopping," as if the victims are going to keep us in love with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published "Lock Love," I have listened to countless stories of men and women who were also explaining, that they learned an unstable lesson of what happened and brought their lives and happy lives and philosophies like employees and spouses, and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm a victim and a survival of domestic violence very typical.
I became married with a hands and nice man and we have those three children.
I have that black book and also that mining.
What I'm not going to go back to have any longer, ever, is a carpenter sheet pointing up my head in somebody's hands that says I want.
At this moment, as you're thinking about, "Hello, that's fascinating." or "Hah, how dumb it was, but all of this time, I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being abused or that they were small or who are abused by themselves.
The matriarch could be affecting his daughter, his sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love to my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Abuse thrives just in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims need everyone.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the male to light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and their friends and family.
Raise their vision of survivors as fantastic people and lovels, who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow up their scale and show victims a safe statement.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in safe and peaceful seats that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have looked like this.  So luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first change of clothing on a TED stage, so you have a lot of luck.
If some of the women were horrified when I got older, they don't have to tell me now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These tattoos are very uncomfortable -- less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to spend this sweater in the head, because it's when you're going to laugh from me, so don't do anything while covers my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also surfaces.
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a kid in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me to release the back and pull the hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial broken like the one that made me two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which is which, although superstring and immortal, has a great impact in our lives.
So today, to me, will be worth it means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a single way.
The first question is, how does it get to be model?
And I always say, a horse I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is because I won genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of a here, and maybe you're wondering what's this inheritance.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health and youth and symmetry -- which we're biologically programmed to admire, we also associate it to a high and bad shape, to the feminist and a white skin.
And that's my heritage, here I have known to harness money for money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now shows skepticism, and maybe there are some lovers of the fashion that say -- wait, there are Nami, Tarah, Joan Samaraschen.
First of all, the happy to know so much of models. It's surprising.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a graduate student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the passage, and from 1767 models hired -- only 27 percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can I be model when it is?
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then, what I really would say to each of these girls is: why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the invention of the next internet, or a heart surgeon and poetry, which would be awesome, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, they still inspire, No, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my boss.
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the U.K. magazine, or the next Stevense Mesziler.
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to earn the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose to.
I'm going to show you all what I learned in 10 years as a model as a model as a model -- as opposed to the cartoonist surgery, it can summarize right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've finished your studies, and you have a crowd and a few jobs to your back; it doesn't matter what you say -- is, if you said you want to be president of the United States, but your curator said, Model of underwear for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are replaced.
And yes, virtually they record all the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture they took me, and also the first time I used a biopsy, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal land, but it was a girl.
So it looks like my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a party party, a few days before the photos for the French Volvo.
Here I am with my football team and in Venezuela magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not myself in those pictures.
These are creations of a group of professionals, the blueprints, and the machines, photographers and stabilities, and all their supporters and pressure people and post-conflict people, and they can do this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: Do you get free?
I have too many tax titles, and I never use it, except the country before, but the privilege I get is the ones that I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a tent, and I forgot to carry money, and they gave me the dress of free.
When I was a teenager, I traveled with my friend who was a pigmented pigmented. He jumped out a red sign and, of course, we stood up, and it was stopped by a feeling agent, agent so that we could keep driving.
I am enjoying these privileges for me, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspects no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the 14,000 teenagers who were stopped and recorded, 86 percent were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there's only 177 young black and Latino young Latinos in New York, so for them, isn't it a question of me?
But how many times I will stand up? And how?
In researching for this talk, I learned that 57 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent at 17 percent.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a model?
And I think the answer you expect is: If you're a little bit harder, and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and strong.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like this.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel and also incredible power to work with creative people, resourceful, and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the brighter horse, will be happier.
They just have to meet up with a group of models, because they have the most delicate legs -- the brightest hair and the mouth of the mouse, but they're probably the most prosperous women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the greatest benefits.
If there is something to come from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was older enough to get a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 most precious pictures, and I wasn't me who pulled them up.
There were no artistic records -- no statistics, no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them out at random.
My story starts when I found myself in New York City to give a ponot, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I reached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, "Why don't you take you to Savan to New York on a passenger journey and keep the risk?
So this is when we start asking the tourists to take the picture.
It's surprising that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and lucky, no one has ever fled to the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change life this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had occurred that day so that a five-year girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October, and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution, over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter brings up new hands, and I can see life through your eyes and how it perceives and interact with it.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking down, when suddenly he stopped in dry and pointed up a red role of the wrist stores that I would love in earlier eyes.
And I described what had felt at five years of foot in that same place.
I began to remember his heart beating with strength when I saw that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one in the picture.
Today I want to encourage you to all to appear in the photograph, and don't doubt to meet someone and ask yourself, do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The borders are in the most threatened bird group.
First of all, why do they have so bad press?
It's also associated with Disney Russian laughter as mental characters, shoes, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press press, applause and classicis, these are the attributes that associate with Kenyan Parliament -- but don't accept it.
Don't accept it. You know why?
Because the parliament members don't keep clean the environment --  Panties don't help prevent diseases.
It's hardly monitoring.   You're far away from extinct.  And my favorite, the borders have better presence --  -- there are two kinds of bookstores on this planet.
There are the New World.
So why are they important, first of all, provide vital ecological services -- they provide vital ecological services.
These are our natural trash collectors.
They wipe up the carcasses to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that they won't be for them to expand and cause large losses of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no books, the carcasses take from three to four times more time in devolution, and this has huge branching radios in disease preparation.
The bookstores also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient Egyptian culture.
Behara was the symbol of the protection and the material, and along with the copper -- shift the unit between the Alaska and the Egyptian Bang.
In the Indian mythology, Jaturi was the god boat, and he risked his life to save the god of the 10 heads of the 1940s.
In the Tibetan culture, they do very important steel entropes in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury dead or wood to create them, so these vessels provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with the borders?
We have eight species of borders in Kenya, which six are in extreme threatened extinctions.
The reason is that they're being sent up, and the reason that they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and fauna, and the structural communities use this venom against predators and as a consequence, the borders are victims of this.
In Southeast Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of borders are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years will be extinct, and the reason is because they fall prey from consumption of livestock that has been treated with an Elizabethan drug like the Declanize.
This drug has been banned for veterinarians in India and have taken a position.
Since there are no bookstores, there has been a spread in the number of dogs in the street seats, and when you have street dogs -- you have a huge amount of time for radiation. The number of cases that have increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind parks in Africa, 353 oceanographers will be on top of the Turkey lake.
I'm not against the wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds -- they cut them in half.
They're birds of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of dead borders to serve the booth and the factory market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're putting them transparent.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so focus on a local problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments on regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the maggots, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that provide them.
How can they help? It can become active, make noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them, we have to focus on these very little creatures. Give their time to spread the word.
When they come out of this room, they will be informed on the boats, but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the brakes.
They are very elegant. Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he watched them fly without effort, no waste of energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
And every thing I do and everything I do professionally. My life has been molding for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1977 to 1977 I read young Long, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East Coast and Somalia. In projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every project we established in failing Africa.
And I was purple.
I thought, at the age of 21, that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead, everything we did is we announced it.
Our first project, the one who inspired my first book, "Weiders of the Zambia, was a project where we started teaching people from Zambia.
So we came up with Italian seeds south of Zambia.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get up.  We were astounded that the locals, in so fragile valley, had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here,"  "Listen to time to save people from Zambian in the famine."
And of course, everything in Africa was really cultured.
We got these wonderful tomorrows. In Italy, a tomato would grow up to this size -- in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the analysis, "Look at the elative agriculture."
When the tomatoes were beautiful, marriages and red from the night in the morning, about 200 hypoches came up from the river and ate them all.  And we said, "Oh my God, the hypochonds."
And the analysts said, "Yes, so we don't have any agriculture here."  "Why don't you say it? You never ask."
I thought we just took mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English did, what the English did, what the French did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the hospitals.
They should see the descriptions --  -- they should see the waste that we give them to the people of Africa.
He wants to read a book, read "Dar Dead of Damascus Moog, economic economist, analyst.
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've surrendered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has changed.
They just read their book.
I launch it from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are improvisations, college missions, and we treat people just two things: or paraplegic, or we're paradoxical.
The two words come from the rat Latin Pathetic," which means parent."
But they mean two different things.
Patiently, I treat any of a different culture like my children, "I want a lot."
Patriciely, I treat all of a different culture like my services.
So the white in Africa are called "Bang," in face.
That book gave me a booth in the face -- "The Little is Beautiful, written by Schulpregger, who said about economic development -- if people don't want to be helpful to be helped.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of help is breathing.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a basement on the ground and said, "We can imagine a city that isn't necessary?"
I decided at 27 years to only respond to people, and I invented a system called Facebook Company where you never start anything, you will never motivate anyone, but it becomes a service of local passion, the slide of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You shut down.
It's never coming to a community with an idea, and it feels like the people of the location.
We don't work from offices.
We assembled in a coffee -- we met on a pub.
We have zero infrastructure zero.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that the man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge because nobody's in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not?
I'm going to tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never support, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money -- what opportunity they've identified about.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The professions is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor, which is established with you in your house, at the table table, in the coffee, and that helps you find resources to transform your passion in a way of winning your life.
I started this as a test in Spain, Western Australia City.
I was doing a PhD at the time, trying to pull away from this conservative garbage that we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can he do that?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I shut up and listened.   So --  So the government says, "Get again!"  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter Drug, one of the greatest companies in history, he passed 60, a few years ago.
Peter Drug was a philosophy professor before they were involved in business, and this is what Peter Drug says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company.
The planning is the kiss of death from corporate spirit.
So now you're reconstructing Christopher without knowing what people are in Christopher want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to get closer to talk to you.
You have to offer them confidence, private privacy, it has to be great at helping them, and then they will be going to come up with mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 cents.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you have more displaced this morning.
Local people passionate -- that's what you've been clapping.
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-to-changing fossil fuels -- manufacturing -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
They have a way to sustain machinery is not sustainable.
What we have to consider is how we nurture -- is how we nurture -- we cure, education, we transport -- we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for green revolution -- universities? Forget it.
Government? Forget it.
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an awful story that in a future magazine a many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in 1860.
And in 1860, he gathered this group of people, and they speculate about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was to meet me: New York City would not exist.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve, and they pointed out, if the population kept growing up to this rate, to bring back to the population of New York around around six million horses.
They were already becoming erasid.  So in 1960, they were spreading this dirty technology that would destroy New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared 110 companies articulate manufacturing companies, 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few purposes, scales, factories in passionate places.
Denmark, Michigan, Hindy.
But there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to give them confidence.
Otherwise, you won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer them an absolute, dedicated service service.
And eventually, you will have to tell the truth with respect to entrepreneurship.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to be able to do three things that you want to do something magnetically: the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to rely on a fantastic trade, and you have to share with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't been born.
We've investigated and looked at 100 companies in the Carnegie world, Western Washington, Edison, Ford -- all the new companies, Google, Jai.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was initiated by one person.
The word "I do, but the word "We are." 32 times.
He wasn't only when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone. None.
So we can create the community where we have facilities, who come from an environment of little businesses sitting on coffee candidates, in bars along their dedicated campaigns who are going to do for you, what someone did this gentleman who speaks about this Egyptian, someone who will ask you, what does it need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, can you sell it? Can you look for money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Would you want me to look for anyone?
We activates communities.
Thank you.
Who surrounds us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange much knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like automatics, plants and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their appropriate?
How can we pay and apologize.
How do we share more memories of our buildings abandoned and better understand our landscape?
How do we share more our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and sleep?
I live in New Orleans and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with giant robots that feed shadows, barriers and sources for centuries and trust in a city.
It is always a parade in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the largest amount of U.S. adoption properties.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Joan, as a mother for me.
Her death was repeatedly and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this produced me deep gratitude for the living time.
She gave him clarity to significant things about my life today.
But I managed to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let you catch through the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house in a giant blade and painted on her phrases to completely completely -- before I die."
So the trans could take a tie, reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect for this experiment, but the next day the wall was reproduced and continued to cover up.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die to be just just put out of person."  Before I die I want to sit on the line of change change."
"Before I die for millions of people."
"Before I died, I want to plant a tree.
"Before I die, I want to live outside the Web.
"Before I died, I want to hug it again."
"Before I die, I want to go to somebody's rescue.
"Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at cards, and they were described, and they gave me advice at difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and scars -- it's about empowering the reflection and the complication, and to remember what the most important thing for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center we made a kit and now have been done walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distraction. It's more important than ever, to find ways of preserving the perspective and remembering that life is brief.
Death is something that we often avoid to talk about, or even thinking about, but I understood that preparing us for death is one of those things that make us more power.
To think about changing death our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than us as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fear and stories, people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
Remember is 22 years old, it's high.
Don't talk about, but it turns out joy better than some of the best speakers.
Remission knows what love is.
And so I share it by increasingly what happens.
It's not apparent. Don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: never lied.
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to provide words that I couldn't even be reminded to me, it reminds me one thing: how little we know about mind and how wonderful it should be.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
It has the most improbable memory.
But it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year that I came out with each of the songs of my iPod -- conversations that we kept when I was four years old, to get my arm during my arm during the first episode of the Telescopes and the Chicago Gagas.
Isn't it amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't adjust to the concept of society, they often are ignorant and understood.
But what drives my heart and forced my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them in the organism, that would only mean one thing: they were extraordinary and autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those less familiar with the term autism," it's a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes to physical abilities.
In every individual it manifests differently from there that Remen is so different to Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, it's diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there is no cause and not known cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot of it.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Rimini lived and reinvented in her own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing and eating anything that would be among the media.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences made more evidence.
But beyond the brands, the frustration and the endless anti-participating, there was something really unique -- a pure nature and an innocent nature -- a kid who sees the world without prejudice, a human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individualism, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change for normal.
The nanoscale goes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what it is.
If I could convey one thing to Remence and Sam.
They can be remarkable.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have, are a donor -- each one of us has a gift in its interior, and honestly, the pursuit of normality, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
Opportunity for great, progress and change die at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what Apple has been in the country of the Marlington.
Penn State asked me, a professor of communications, which gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared --  Student, assumed from these students with their great minds, their great books and their big books and unknown words.
But in developing those conversation, I felt what Alice should have felt when she fell through the hole of the coat and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students, and I was amazed with the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenge, from energy in the environment and care of health: among others, and if we don't know and understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these large conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please smell beautifully.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy.
First question to say, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
They don't just tell us that they study the knife, but they study the concerts, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the assumptions.
And when they're describing their science, care with jargon.
The slang is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say "special and temporary temperature, but why don't you say space and time that is much more accessible to us?
Make them accessible to make them accessible.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways to cheat and engage with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of ball."
Have you wondered why they call battles?"  What do tails do? Ballots kill, and they will kill their presentation.
A film like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the area of our brain and it's overwhelmed.
Instead, this film of Geneva Brown, is much more effective -- shows that the special structure of the control is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel tower.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence: legal, that audiences can understand if you miss a little bit, and then provide graphs that eject our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's described to it.
I think these are just some keys that can help us open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists, and engineers, when they have solved this equation, for all the means of all the means --  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford Oxford is "song."
Just because it sounds very well.
And "Soupology means "plastic politics."
Although there was a newspaper editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A song is the one that looks for a public charge without any party or platform or principle, and that, when you win, you get it for the use of a mobile verb verballows."
I have no idea of what "fighting means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't until -- for example, 1973 that Parliament Parliament allowed newspapers to cite the words that were said in the parliament chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the value of a guy with the insulation of Brown Cross, who was faced to Parliament Parliament.
I read in London in London and he was collapsed, but he had the courage to face them, and at the end he had a popular support in London to win.
And just a few years later, we had the first uniform use of the phrase "sort of ball as the metal.
Most people think it's linear.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the United States, right after independence.
So they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This is unleashed in Congress for a long time.
They had all sorts of suggestions that they could have formed.
Some of you wanted to call it "Leve from State Water," and others, "Your Al-Qaeda German Washington, and other Defense liberties of the U.S. Library of the U.S.
Not very attractive.
Some just wanted to call it Red."
They thought it was a fluke.
And it wasn't even monitoring, they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a given person.
And it could be serious.
Everyone is immensely income, because this debate is protoning for three weeks.
I read a day of a poor send, and he always wrote, "This issue."
What caused the retrospect and the top was that the Representation of Represent was against the Senate.
The Charter of Representations didn't want Washington to be abused by power.
They didn't want to call it King in case it would give him or her self-driving idea.
So they wanted to give the title more modernist, more inclusive, and more simple than they came up with.
And that title was President."
President. They didn't invent the title -- there was no longer before, but it just meant someone who is pressing a meeting."
It was like the president of a jury.
And it didn't have much more great than the term "scholarship or "Spring."
There were exceptional president of little colonial and government facilities, but it really was an insignificant.
And so the Senate is opened.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it "President."
"This guy has to sign up and meet extravageness diagrams.
"And who will take him seriously with a degree as ridiculous and insignificant as President of America?"
And finally, after three weeks' debate, the Senate didn't categorize.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been reflected by the title of President.
President Barack Obama has luck.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary --  -- we can keep waiting for 320 years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this, I want to leave you -- is that the U.S. prototype of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 warheads of nuclear warheads to device, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of UAVs.
The reality and the story have given the title of gravity.
So at the end of the Senate.
They got their responsibility.
And also, the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of singue, well, it was a singue at the time.
But you know how many nations have now president?
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate won and the Chamber of Representations lost because nobody's going to feel humble when they tell them they're the president of the U.S.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and I would like to leave you.
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape reality, but really, it measures much more the words than they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to subway meters in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat, and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of surreal bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices to talk about, but most of all, that cathland of male and stones with primitive tools.
Like the rest, I carry a little bit of light light on the head with this elaborate elephant, and I can barely tell the baselines that hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was broken up my hand, and I suddenly remember a man that I met days earlier, which lost control and fell feet in that body.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole risking their lives without paying or reward and often dying.
I came out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it, because they are pressure of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only exhibition at the Peace of Peace Panthe.
Among all the amazing people that I met there met an internist from Andrew the Slaves, an NGO who dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew it existed in the world but not such a degree.
When we ended up to talk to me was very bad -- honestly I was embarrassed to ignore this attractiveness of our days and thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I came up with a stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of "Art the Slaves and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had already been in many of these places.
Some, even considered my second home.
But this time, I would sell the dirty sheets.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of the transatlantic slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent to about 50,000 dollars.
However, today you can enslave the whole family for generations by steam density 18.
Surprisingly, slavery generates over 13 billion dollars a year worldwide.
Many have been fooled with false promise of good education and better work in order to discover that they are forced to work with no pay, low violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in trade, goods produced by slavery people have value, but those who produce them are described.
slavery exists around the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India, and Nepal, I met bricks.
This strange, complex show was like entering the old Egypt or the Information of Danor.
Countless in a temperature of 54 C, men, women, women, in fact, early families wrapped into a heavy spade of dust -- they eject mechanically brick in their head, up to 18 at once, and they bring them out of the horror furnaces to trucks that are to hundreds of meters.
Designed by the monkey and the scandal work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no parasites to eat, or to drink, and severe depression was made to pee out pretty intrinsic.
And so penguins were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and stopped working.
And every 20 minutes, I had to run into the car, and make it work with air conditioning to revive it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera receives a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the horizons I wanted to cry, but the ancient who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "Listen, don't do it. Don't do it."
And it explained to me very clearly to show emotions in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nowhere.
I wasn't a citizen from that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on Freedom the Slaves and work within the system for its release, and he trusted them to get it.
For me, I hope to get home to feel my heart heartbreak.
In the Himalayas, I found kids running stones for miles up to trucks that were waiting underneath.
Those big plants were more heavy than the kids who hunt them and children hold them to their heads with nostrils made out of steps, strings and shots.
It's hard to witnessed something so overwhelmed.
How can we influence something that insists, but so compliment?
Some people don't even know they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without paying -- because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to share.
When these villagers replaced their freedom, the slaves.
When you hear the word slavery we often think about sexual traffic and because of this world consciousness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Kathnigo I was introduced women who had been previously sexual slaves.
I was driven by a few scarred stairs that were giving this dirty basement, of light fluid light.
It wasn't exactly a barrier.
It was rather a restaurant.
Responsibility, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small, private rooms -- where slavery scans with their girls and children, some of them seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a boom and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sexual abuse for their client.
Standing in the blackboard, I remember feeling a hard acute fear and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be left in that hell.
I just had a salt: the stairs where I came in.
There were no door doorstep.
There were no windows enough to climb out.
Those people don't have a scan and because we play such a difficult topic, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture in restaurants, in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often related to the labor of slavery work.
I visited Indian villages, where there were family families in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
Your hands of black are from the father and the blue drinks and the red.
They mix up in these big barriers and dip up the silk in the liquid to the elbow, but the ink is toxic.
My interpretation told me his stories.
"We don't have freedom." They said.
"We still wait, though, to be able to get out of this house someday and go somewhere else where our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the Volta lake, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a family of fishermen in a boat, two older brothers, some children younger -- makes sense.
Wrong. They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their traditional families, disappeared and forced to work on these boats in these boats in the lake -- despite not knowing anything.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came up with was being beaten up, it was afraid that his little candle was improvising.
I was paralyzed by fear of falling the water.
The rectangles of the tree superstring in the Love Lawren often catch networks and children, participated with fear and stretches to the water to unleash the branches.
Many are playing.
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run and, like all of life has been dealt with credit, creating the younger slaves under her command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they lifted the last five networks, but they had been working on one of them.
On the cold night and veil.
And it turns out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds, when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kofon.
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where I learned the Slippers replaced the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
By driving on a road in Ghana with some sort of Art on the Sloves, a company with her mountain suddenly accelerate and suppressed our car and knocks the window.
It asked us to follow it on a way to the forest.
At the end of the road, he invited us to get out of the car, and he asked the driver.
Then he pointed out this sense just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the walk. Come on!
As we started to scroll, we removed the wards that blocked the road, and after walking around an hour we found that the journey was caught by the recent rain, so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as we go through these waters to the chest.
After two hours of truck, the single way ended up abruptly in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field and they were all full of slavery.
Many women had children tied to their backs, and as they were looking for gold bag, they were walking in water with marketing.
The market is used in the process of extraction.
These mines are slavery in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were packed in their own sweating.
I remember looking at her thin chartered, iron, given that many had been under the land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 meters, and these people carry heavy bags out of stone that then will be transported to another area where they will kill the stone to be able to extract the gold.
First of all, the site seems to be filled with strong men and vegetables, but if we look closer to close, to the margin, we see working on other ones and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it is very likely that this muscle ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and methane in a few years.
This is Maugh. When he died his father his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When I die his uncle, Mauritanna inherit the debt of the uncle to be slavery in mines.
When I met it, I had worked on the mines 14 years and the request of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so severe that doctors said it should be amputated.
In addition to that, Manual has tuberculosis, and not just that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Still, he dream with being released and educated with local activists like Andrew the Slowed -- and it's this kind of determination, from face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen for you worldwide.
I wanted you to know that we will give us testimony from them and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I happen to think of these beautiful people, sharpers, that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force where you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force goes through a fire, and that fire will shine light on slavery because, without that light, the beasts of slavery can continue to live on shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math approaches, and there's a peculiar problem for anyone to do that: we're like managing management consultations.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
They give us the virtues of the whale and the dancing dancers.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably certain initial attitude that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neural disorders like Parkinson's bad destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jane Steilera who, at his time, was a virtual dancer dancer.
In the last few years, it's been a lot of progress progress in the last few years.
However, there are 6.3 million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable skill, temporarily, retrofitting and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective matrix and a cure.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers. That's why they don't serve blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never do.
And how about patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult journey to the clinic. How about patients could do the exam themselves?
You wouldn't need staff.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to offer to you as a conventional way to try and try and try, you see, in a certain sense at least -- we're all true as my friend Ian Steinberg.
This is a video of the empty vibration.
It shows someone healthy as it moves sound as they speak. We can imagine as dancers from a vocal bathroom because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound and we all have the genes necessary -- the Photoshopper, for instance.
And like the ball, it requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time he takes a child learn to learn how to talk.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as they vibrate -- and as Parkinson's affects extremists, it also affects the vocal organs.
In the bottom short, you can see an example of regular templess from vocal strings.
We see the same symptoms.
vocal temple, weakness and regret.
The speech becomes more quiet and aspiring after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do these tests compare in the voice with specialized clinical trials -- well, they're both not invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive. Both use existing infrastructure.
We don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both precise. Well, but also the tests are based on voice are not specialized in voice.
I mean, they can be automated.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as many.
They are completely measured, and we all know what happens.
When something acquires a cost so low, it appears on a massive scale.
These are some incredible goals ready to deal with.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties.
Needless to go to the clinic for routine clock.
With high management monitor, we could get objective data.
We could make low-cost mass recovery for clinical trials, and for the first time, clearly clocks at the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biodegradations of the disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first step in that sense, we're launching the Voice Vacancies Initiative Initiative.
Together to Accusell and Pakistan, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to tackle these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
Any of you, with or without Parkinson's with Parkinson, it can call at the price and leave recordings for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So Maha, taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, will be able to say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will they pull out of these pictures?
Max Littley: Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not. TR: Sure.
MJ: You see, some people may not have it. You may not finish it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances -- and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for the computer factors to look for the real markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now?
MT: Much more than that.
Actually, my student Thomas, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic work, and now it has proven that it works on the mobile phone network as well, which is applied to the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: Novel and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
JM: Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Little public.
MT: Thank you, Tom.
Before March of 2011, I made photographic portraits in New York City.
We're painful creatures, gray.
We hide in the dark, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid solar light.
We do the most thin models that are still defendable, the perfect skin even more perfect to do the impossible -- possible and criticized us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talents with many years of expertise and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
Shortly on, an organization where it was a volunteer, there Hans Voltans, was in place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 traveled to October.
It's a little fishing town in the Internet President of nearly 500,000 people, one of the first towns affected by the waves.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall, and over three kilometers inside.
As you can imagine, the town was devastating.
We pulled out the waterways and the banjos.
We cleaned up schools. We removed the shore and we left the houses ready to be renewable and replaced.
We removed tons and tons of dead fish -- appealed, power of local mill.
We went back and loved it.
For weeks, both the volunteers as the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and labor and chambers and cards and cards.
They all did the same thing.
Get them up and bring them to different places of people around to keep them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered.
As they fled the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started helping in a center of evaluation in the town.
It helped clean the communal restroom on the vast, giant baby.
This place turned out to be the place of the town where the vaccination center collected the photos.
They took them up, and I had the honor that that day would trust me to wipe up the pictures.
This was exciting and inspired -- I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of a hundred years old of them were still at the top of the lab -- I couldn't help you think about how to fix that rating and repair that screw and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night came into Facebook with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive -- that I knew we had to try.
So we started playing the photographs.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too stupid, but where the water had declared the face of the girl to fix a lot of precision and delicate.
Otherwise, that girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the short picture.
Over time, they came up for luck more photos, and they needed more retrofits so that I went back on Facebook and Lincoln and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
After two weeks, I had 150 people wishes to join together.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Redwood, a village neighbor in the north of Mahama.
Once we were using our scanner in the temporal photographic libraries that had been installed, where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time they took to deliver them is a different story, depending on the defense of the photos.
I could start an hour. It could be a week.
I could spend months.
This king had to draw virtually by hand using as guidance and droplets that color and detail had not destroyed the water.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures underground in saltwater water, covered by bacteria, with algae even, with airplane, all of this with oil, all of it along with the time of time continues to deflect them, so they wipe them by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't play the picture unless it was clean and dry and it would have been replaced by his owner owner.
We had luck.
We have a good neighbor with the guideline.
It's very easy to hurt the pictures of the picture.
As Wenny once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky in relationship to the photos.
He had begun to wipe them up, but he stopped realizing that he gave it even further.
It also had duplicated.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to reconstruct, we could blow up the images in a single picture and regain the whole picture.
When I picked up his pictures shared something from his story with us.
A couple of colleagues in her husband found the pictures in a station of bombs between the very far businesses where she used to be her house, but his colleagues acknowledged him.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the waves.
It had to go inside the water as the sandwiches were dreaming.
Her small children, not so small now, but his two sons were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and knew that everybody had survived.
The day he gave her pictures her youngest son for 14 years.
For it, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do something that he could go back to look, something that he could remember from the past that would not have been mapped through that day of March.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there and hundreds of them helped us clean up by more than 13,000 pictures of 11,000 pictures -- the vast majority majority, -- the vast majority of their owners went back to their own owners.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us to give rise to 90 family and rotated photos and rotates.
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printers.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a relationship -- somebody loved to.
They are soap from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us but the first thing we would come back to look for.
This was the project of restoring little pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this is going back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the retrospect.
Some of them connected to something larger, to give something, using their talent for something that is not models of perfect skin.
So to finish I'd like to read this email. I sent it in the day I came back from Japan after six months.
Meanwhile, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in pictures.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathered around a baby, met me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mom and my daughter newborn.
In the whole world, in all the times our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.  Apple Repaises.
Doctor Edward inspired us and curious and curious with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just one million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion frames per second.
I present a new kind of photography, the photography, a new technique so fast that it can create video videos of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the rings, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body, without using X-rays without using X-rays and really challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionaire in a second of a second, I mean, in several females, create a picture of photons of just a millimeter of bandwidth.
And that packet of photons that ball through the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
So if we take that balance and this package of photons and shoot on this bottle, how do those photons are spreading inside this bottle?
What is the aspect of light in slow camera?
Now, all of this --  -- remember, that all of this happens effectively in less than a nanotube is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola, not absolutely associated with this investigation.  This is a lot of stuff in this film, developing this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our ball, comes into the bottle, with a package of photons that starts to go through and that inside, it starts to spread.
Part of the light is floating, goes to the table, and we start seeing these foundations.
Many of the photons finally get to the lid and then explode in several directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble.
At that time, the waves travel down the table, and because of the reflections of the top of the top you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several squares, the reflection of the reflection.
Now, if we take a common and closing bullet and we have to go back the same distance and see it on slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would lead us to see that film?
A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- a slow bullet in motion.
How about testing with dead nature?
You can see the waves of the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a rock in a pond.
It's the way nature painted a picture, and he thought, of a female at once, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at one more time, you'll notice that, as light is adopting the tomato -- it's still brilliant. It doesn't be discarded.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light bounce inside and it goes back after several trillion billions.
In the future, when this female is in your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photographer, you know, if we take a little bit of exposure, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest display, so you just get something out of light.
We sent that bay, that package of photons -- millions of times, and we recorded again and again with a very astronomical synchrony, we took those giant data giants and we trained it to create those females that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and process them in interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a superhero future would allow him to see after the rings?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, to the Bowl, to go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple robots of light.
It's not science fiction. We have already built it.
On the left, there is our feminism.
Behind the wall there is a manipulation and we'll pull light on the doorstep.
After the publication of our paper in Nature Communism.
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, at moments slightly different.
And because we have a camera that works, our female, our female, has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what extent it costs to what distance.
When you project a laser, you can record a picture in a boundary, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we'll put them together and try and analyze the multiple robots of light, and with that, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D.
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that prevent collisions with what's on the curve of the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build a lot of comparison to see the inside of the body by surrounding the colors, and the same for cars.
But of course, because of tissue and blood this is pretty difficult, so actually, this is a request to scientists to start thinking about photography as a new mode of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So like Doc Edward, he himself a scientist, turned the science in art, an art of players of players.
I realized that all the great data giants that we collected are increasingly not just for scientific scientists, but we can.
Create a new form of computer photography with slow camera and code code.
And look at those waves. Remember, time between each one of those waves is just a few billion seconds.
But here is also something funny.
If you look at the waves underneath the lid, these are beating away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost to the speed of light, we have extra effects. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order is that the events in the world sometimes appear to the camera.
By applying the correct deforestation of space and time, we can correct this distance.
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can change life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria in Syria.
With a cell phone can take a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, put it up to Southam and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a child in 1984 and I live in the city of Fine City.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protesting for a change.
This is the face of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathered in search for a change, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who has a cell phone here?
Get them up.
Raise your cell phones leave.
Get them up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost all today have a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my cell phone, and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
This is 35 dollars of information.
Data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a direction.
The Department of data Represent.
This directive says that every European telephone company, every Internet provider, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who calls an email to anyone.
Who sends a text.
And if we use mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored at least six months, and up to two years, in your phone company, or your Internet provider.
And all around Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data detection.
We want the self-organizing in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone to make all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to Berlin streets and said, "Libert, not fear."
And some even said this would be the Star 2.0.
The Stanford was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information on us?
Any time I use the phone?
So I asked my phone, Delou Televaler, who at the time was the largest phone company in Germany, that please send me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah, white.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're protecting my life.
So I decided to start a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Dertrus Televater said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, we signed an agreement.
I would pull up the demand and they send me the information I could.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional tribunal failed the introduction for German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly baby on brown with a CD.
And in the CD there was this.
And it turns out and five thousand connections.
At the beginning, I saw them and said, well, it's an enormous archive. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little scientist: what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to go out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data data means.
So next to Zeit Online and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom up and down, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from Frankenstein's trying to collapse to Colony, and how often I call the trajectory.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them among them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to another, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate to each other to what time they call each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers -- the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study your society, because you know who talks to whom, who send an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people on the streets in Berlin in the late 1989, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the Starrow would have known who involved in this protest, and if the Star had known who the leaders, it would never have happened.
The decline of Berlin may never have happened.
And as opposed to the Earth Correct.
Because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as possible inside and outside the Web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to store them forever.
But the self-organizer and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the automation.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to tell their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not overlooked.
When they go home, give them to their report that only because companies and state agencies can store certain information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remember you have to fight for the strength in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is Mayon Zeala, and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have cerebral parasites, which is why I know all the time.
Look.
It's a stupid. I'm like a Shakespeare mix.
And Muhammad Allen.
P.C. C is not genetics.
It's not congestion or it can be contracted.
Nobody claimed my mother and I didn't control it because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It just goes through accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want any of the speakers to represent.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they have chosen to be disabled.
Let's go from walk.
Christmas Christmas are at the commercial center, they drive in circles in search for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabilities.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit of a disappeared?"
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P, C is just one of them.
There will be a supply of opportunity, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a paleontologist, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Paris Clinton, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
Many people with cerebral palsy, they don't walk on, but my parents don't believe in the tent."
The mantra of my father was "you can do it, dancing the candy."
If my three older sisters collide, I cleaned.
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents were suing the school system and made sure that I would also go out, and if we didn't sat up all the major note of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years putting my heel in her feet and just walking around.
Another technique that I used was to fold a dollar in front of me to pursue it.
The spread that I carry into was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten garden walked as a bag camp that has received a lot of bags.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs, and they remain all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use "Judge to Muslims as a weapon of campaign.
People who grew up didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to worry a lot to die of starvation during the range.
I told them that I had enough fat enough to live three months without eating eating so that they will get out of the dawn at sunset is very easy.
I danced in Broadway.
Yes, in Brown. It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with heels, so I can walk with heels.
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends were using titles, I crashed.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vessels on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summer in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine every summer, we would become Manhattan.
In the summer of summer, my father was trying to stand up, so I drink milk milk -- put hot cups on my back, dip me in the Dead Sea, and I remember that the water burned me and thought, "Wow, work."
But the miracle cure was the degree.
I should say that it's very boring, but before I did yoga was a student command, I couldn't stand up with a foot of foot."
And now I can stand on my head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the General Hospital.
I went to college, through positive discrimination and I got a fellowship for the United States, University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the courts.
It was like the mascot of the theater department.
Everyone loved me.
I made all of the least intelligent tasks, I took my maximum note in my classes and also in his class.
Every time I made a scene from the crystal chair my teachers cried.
But I never got a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the U.S. decided to make a piece called Bangladesh very slowly.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral parasites.
I was a girl with cerebral parasites.
So I started yelling to the four winds," "In order to have a role of paper.
I have a cerebral pandemic."
Alberto fine."
Thanks to God a post-conflict, I am free."
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to Shermer Brown.
I went to increase running to the director of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask why, and she told me that because they believed that they couldn't do the risk of risk.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunt either.
It was a role for which I literally had been born and gave it to an actor without cerebral parasites.
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of hearing actors without disability for papers of disability.
When I graduated, I went home, and my first actor tour, was as an outsider on a television.
My dream made reality.
And I knew it would be complained to "member friend in a sandwich.
Instead, I was sitting there like a car, and I didn't see more than the one, and it was obvious to me that the reports of repeated weren't hiring fresh actors, not white, with disability.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Whole Gold, Rosetta Barry, Ellas, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedians.
So I became hydrophobicity.
In my first tour, I took famous comic comic from New York to New Jersey, and I would never forget the face of the first comic that led to when he fell in the beads that he was going on high speed by the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral paintings.
I worked on clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic.
Some people say I'm the first monopoly in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty buzz that says that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the Ferrif of New York, now in his 10 years.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the American replacements in the media and the same time to remind the ROVs and Arabs are not synthesized.
To integrate Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program with Keith Olymput.
I went through as if I went to a graduation dance, I was arrested to a study and sat on a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, "Excuse me, can you give me another chair?"
She looked at me and said, "Fifth, four, three, two."
And we were live.
So I was clinging to the desk of the present to not get out of the screen during the sediment, and when I finished the interview, I was stumped.
At the end, I had my opportunity and disappeared. I knew they would not be invited to me.
But not only Mr. Obama came back to invite me, but it was just like participating in full time and I taped my chairs.
Something funny that I learned in direct with Keith Obama was that people on the Internet are sculpture.
It's said that kids are cruel, but they never miss me or a kid or any more.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object object.
I see online clips like, "Why do you know?"
"Is it retrospect?"
And my favorite, "Poor burning terrorists.
What disease?
We can really pray for it."
A fellow suggested that I would add my disability to my curriculum, guinea, comet, paradigm.
The disability is as visual as the race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make Beijing, then Beijing can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disability is -- yeah, clap, man. Come on.
The disability is the largest minority in the world, and the most suspicious in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm standing here in front of you.
But to have grown up with media media, I don't think I was.
I hope you can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would make less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My utter journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to walk through the red carpet of the back of the televisions Susan Lucifer and the Blanched Land Brown.
I came to acting in a film with Adam Sandwich and working with my pain, the incredible Dave Matthews.
It turns out the world by coming across the Arab has become crazy."
I was denied by the great state of New Jersey at the CO2 in 2008.
And I founded "The children of Massachusett, a charity organization to give kids Palestinian refugee for a single part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me active, and I read this talk to her memory.
"Let me give you in peace, paper."
My name is Mayon Zadia, and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little town south of Somali in Somalia.
This town is near Mozart.
The drought pushes the little town to poverty and the edge of the imagination.
With nothing for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, Mozart, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunity, there's no work, no persuasive perspective.
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside Mozart.
After maybe a year, nothing happened.
One day comes up with a gentleman who offers to bring him to lunch, after dinner, to breakfast.
It knows a group of people who have a descendant.
It gets a little money to buy new clothing, money to send home to his family.
They present a young man.
It's finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life of life.
A beautiful day in Momanjudin, under a blue sky, a bomb car.
That little boy with dreams of the great care was the suicide bomber and that dynamic group of people were to the Shakespeare, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how about a story of a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him?
He was waiting for.
I was expecting an opportunity, hoping to start his future, hoping for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came in.
This was the first thing that came out of what we call "the "Waiture Persite."
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the marketing -- robustly unemployed urban young people who are devastating riots in Jonathan, declared riots in London, which seeks something beyond the waiting period.
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity, of work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunity, the story of the wife of wait, the gateway of access to terrorism, to violence, to the pandemics, will be the history of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, Mozart, 70 percent of young people are unemployed.
Seventy percent don't work, don't go to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to Mozart last month, and I went to visit the Madison Hospital.
I remember being to that hospital calculated to balls thinking, and if I had never left?
And if I had seen forced to be in that same time?"
Would it have become a terrorist?
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was at Mahmoud that month was actually to beat some juvenile leaders in a business block.
It goes back to about 90 juvenile leaders of it.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He went to the University of Mogadishu, graduated.
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, he was a graduate university, unfortunately, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shakespeare and other terrorist organizations, to be recycled.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different way.
In Momanjui, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
Seventy-five years of civil war have completely destroyed the visual system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to move around.
And they saw an opportunity and I took it.
It started a motorcycle company.
She started beating the local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of her family and friends, and her dream is at some point to expand hundreds of cars over the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What makes this story different?
I think his ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the wife."
It empowers young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so depressing.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Muhammad Mohami, a flute.
I was helping me train some of the youngsters at the top of the entrepreneurial initiative and how to be innovative, and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it is the first flute that Madmocran has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came up, if you wanted flowers to your wedding bowl, you would use plastic we were plastic from the outside.
If you asked somebody to ask someone, "When was the last time you saw fat flowers?"
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: Never.
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of landscape and flower design.
He created a farm in the outskirts of Mogadishu, and he started growing up and light and litigation, and he said, could they survive the category of Mozart.
And it started the delivery of flowers for bosses, creating gardens in the houses, and the companies, and now it's working on creating the first public park of Momigon in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mommirrou.
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial rose.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink, because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Muhammad had a really deep impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought of working for an NGO, working for government, to work for government, but their history, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be artifacts of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
They identified business solutions for local problems.
So inspired young people and create a business of entrepreneurial spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and orientation to guide them in development and put their businesses.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, to give them the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers here.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Peace Park -- this is how it calls it, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
They took the kids out of the street to help rent and keep the monkeys for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the parachute period."
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, they turn young people in companies, they bond and feed their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and parks of peace than bubbles and "species of wait."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping up with my dad in the Adam mountains, an area in the north of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The censorship forest.
The sun would cause the leaves to glow as a virus, and it's not going to be the way we carry on, we can hardly pretend that we were the first human beings to weigh that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a cover in a river with sight to a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible when I discovered something.
Behind the cover there was a ship, from about four square feet with apple heart balls and sub-Saharan paper balls and candles.
And I was analyzed, I was very angry.
The capsules that were too lazy to pull out what they had been trained, who thought she was going to wipe up their baseball?
That question continued to me and simplify a little bit.
Who clean our baby?
No matter how they organize or where they put our own, who clean our trash in Studio?
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris, or in London or in London?
Here in New York, the Department of Sangivali clean our trash -- to 10,000 tons of waste and two thousand tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know it as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that job.
What does it feel to use the uniform and bring that charge?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in trucks and walked through his journey and interviewed people in offices and facilities throughout town, and I learned a lot, but it was still an impostor.
I needed to get closer to myself.
So I started working as a trash collector.
Now I didn't just travel on trucks. I drove them.
And he operated the mechanics and the snow.
It was an amazing privilege and an astonishing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as much as they believe -- and in the days that it's very strong one is used quickly.
It costs a lot to use weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies continue to adjust the weight of taking over their body tons of trash every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Office of Laboratory Stations, the collection of waste is one of the 10 most dangerous concerns in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and coming into traffic.
They just want to happen, so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and provide terrible damage damage.
I also learned about the implantation of garbage.
When you get out of the room, and you see a city from the back of the truck, you can understand that trash is as a force of nature itself.
It's never stopped coming.
It's also as a form of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think that records of waste are the most important workforce on the streets of town, for three reasons.
These are the first protein in public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in efficient and effective form every day, this starts to fall out of your content and your inherent dangers threatened in very real ways.
Diseases that we had controlled for decades, and centuries come back and start to tell us.
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we have no room for the new thing that the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just the point of relationships.
And then there's what I call our average speed every day necessary.
I mean just at the speed that we used to move in contemporary time.
We usually don't care about, and we don't replace, we wipe up or take our coffee cup -- our bag of our sensors, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them, we forget them from them, because we know there's a force force on the other side that will collapse from it.
So today I want to suggest a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and include it in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Your work, I think, is almost literary.
You're on the street every day, in a rhythmic way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to wait.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own waste, our self-reporting, and that flow will always remain in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the group of a walking truck truck on the street, I grabbed my little kid and lowered the stairs running down, and there was a man doing his journey of paper recycled as the sandwiches.
And I tried to thank him to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just nodded it, and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started researching the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called Paulo, we worked together, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to reclaim the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and keep in account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about barbaric, represent three percent of the amount of waste of nations.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see someone whose job is to clean the garbage of you, take a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life by building parts of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I put two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analytics from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Adam Abbe.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and I, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go away?"
After seeing some of these buildings, there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to restore.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because of crystal recording generates heat inside the interior, so it's necessary a lot of cooling.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees per year.
And thirdly, his appearance has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a pin trying to be a place that is so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really captured with the ancient market, which is this open-air structure where thousands of people go and buy things every day to little vendors.
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, from several floors, apply these principles.
The next challenge was presented by inspiring the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth of town, where a lot of the buildings we see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the input into the building.
And this spreads up with an innate attack that creates an air space in the building that will be self-cleaning -- by its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes in every floor because of the space of space.
I also thought, how will the building?
I wanted to find a solution to respond to local climate conditions.
And I set out to think of a similar tissue to a hormone capture with performances to allow the air into the air, and also from light, but in a filter way.
We then inspired ourselves into these beautiful buttons of the estate stream.
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the face.
We're building that with these little predatory pieces that are the windows that leave air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is complicated with these little crystals of colors that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what we can."
But we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because ultimately there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
And the first thing was to think about how to achieve energy extraction for the building in a city where electricity takes nearly every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting photographs on the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these pockets on the roof, which actually collect water for the sanitation inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest I ever designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the middle, a 1,000-pound structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access doors connected by nearly straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks that are similar in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards with these pathogens.
In addition to that, we selected some strategic points in relationship with the idea of internal doors with straight lines, and this modifying the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project as the parking, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would it be the best orientation for an apartment in the Mediterranean climate?
And it's Norway, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we set up a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with courtyards and then on the bottom floor, we have all the connections for the petroletes.
And it also responds to local norms that establish greater density on top levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And also reflects this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like overthrowing the community occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors can rise, and socialize, and make activities such as running a two kilometers in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives, changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions by looking for simple solutions -- but affordable.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable as you see all the new girls.
It had huge amounts of hair and a little scholar of little little little spines, nice strands. It was super strong for the capital capitals of state, very good for professionalism.
I ended up that year and I was full of stops, until I swallowed my single plan.
I had a time after the exit of school, I was a little late and I hid myself in the bathroom of girls.
When the cost was retreated, I went out in the classroom, and he took the table of my master's book.
And then I did.
I altered my rival ratings, just a little bit, just some.
All the time.  And I set up giving the book, but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a seat, I cut up the notes around the world, no imagination.
I put all the lines from Dead and myself a line of that, just to be there, because I could.
I still surprise what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught.
It's that everything was unbearably obvious.
I never was caught.
But most of all, I find the reason why I was annoyed that this child, so small, was so good for prophetic.
I am introducing the skins.
They're so mysterious and so penetrative.
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The blue birds are very likely.
We know that the hairs are the number one cause of carbon killers in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzes loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So we have to go to fiction because novels are like the laboratory that they study in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no skins, there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no Helena the influence, no Odysseus.
There would be no sill king or "The 1600s and a night."
There would be Shakespeare.
They disappeared the list of reading readers from high school, because we would be losing "The Rush and the Further," there would be "Galois and "First." We would miss from "Madame King."
No fangs, there is no Proteum. I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost all of them have.
This year is about 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of the lost time -- the most successful study of sexual selectives and also of ordinary complexity, I know everything we could have,  And thinking about Prozac, we have the permanent details, right?
We think of a kid trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a melody male in you of lapping.
We forget how hard that image.
We forget how incomplete it is.
That is, it is books that Virginia Wolfram said they were as hard as the trophy trap.
I don't know what the cat is, but we assume it's super superstring.
Let's see why they go so well together, novel and skins and skins and Proton.
Is it going to be very obvious as the skins, which are reduced to the person, to your wish, to your imperatives, are a good narrative foundation.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel skin.
When we feel something, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
And by being names and audience, we know exactly what details include, to peg the chocolate, right?
The ice makes us all native novels, and that's something that Proust understood it.
Everything he does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to tell himself that history, and since then, Project says that every French charm that Swanzan relies on her love, add her to his collection of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit, Song and Prostanda, they were notoriously sticker.
You know, the Protons of Protein would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break on it.
But you don't have to be so hard to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
The skies are adopted.
It's a hungry emotion, you have to feed it.
And what are the skins?
The hairs are nurtured from information.
The skins use the details.
The hairs like large amounts of hair and cute and small struggles.
The skies are nurtured from pictures.
That's why I was instructing that instruments is so successful --  Project links well the language with the skins.
When Stanford is in her fingertips, he suddenly hear behind the door and broken to the services of his love, then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is replaced, but it's not different to the interpretation of an ancient text or to look at a monument."
He says, "You're really scientific research with real intellectual value.
Project is trying to prove that the hairs are unstable, and they make us seem absurd, but in their mind, they are looking for knowledge, search for the truth, a painful truth, in fact, to what Project is, the more painful the truth.
Pain, the humiliation, the loss: These were the pathways to Prosecutor wisdom.
He says, "A woman who we need -- that makes us suffer, causes us to provide ourselves in a range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be interested with.
Is it telling us that we're going to look for cruel women.
No, I think it's trying to say that the hairs reveal ourselves.
Is there any other excitement that makes us open up in this particular way?
Is there any other excitement reveals our aggression, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Does any other excitement that teaches us to look at intensity so peculiary?
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was consumed with the idea that her woman would deceive it.
And Freud says there was something bizarre in that man, who didn't look at what his wife was doing.
Well, she was innocent. Everybody knew it.
The poor critter was under suspected without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without knowing, interpreted behavior.
Does it smile too much? Or accidentally rock up with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the concentration of his wife's unconscious.
The novels are really good at this.
The novel describes very well how cells do to look forward but without precision accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely jealous, we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the skins lead us to make violent acts or illegal.
The skins drive us to behave in totally imaginative ways.
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight years, I recognize it. But I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook in Facebook from the one who was sending out violent messages, awful to itself, for a year.
For one year. A whole year.
She was trying to instill the new kid of his former school, I have to confess that when or this, they react with addiction.
Because, let's be realistic.
So massive, even though unfortunately, creativity, right?
It's like novel.
Like a November Happiness novel.
Hyderabad is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange character of the American literature.
It's the author of "Letter in a Treat and "The Talking Mr. Richard," the books that are dealing with how jealousy, confuse our minds, and once we are in the sphere -- the membrane that separates what it might be, can be punched in an instant.
Let's take Richard Richard, her most famous character.
Tom Riley goes to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to want to do what you have to take away from your self and to get out of what you've ever had, and it's under the floor, and it responds to
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom Richard.
I can't give you all the world, as much as sometimes I want to.
It's a pity, because we live in time of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is enemy? Right?
Shouldn't the novel show us the relation? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go back to Bakout Battery Street and ask Shermer Holly.
When people think about Hollywood, he thinks about the male in Professor Marring, that criminal genius in Professor Britain.
But I've always prefer to the Institute of the Lost Institute," the head face of Scotty Darwin who needs Homo desperately needs the genius of Hollywood, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Lester needs its help, but the resilient thing, and bubble with amateur in each of the mysteries.
But how they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Avenue of the Sixth Navalos," once Hollywood comes in, he goes back to Hollywood and says, "We're not jealous, Mr. Hollywood.
We're proud of you."
And he tells him that there's no person in Scotty Darwin who didn't want to shake his hand.
It's one of the time that we see Homo traded in history. I think this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious -- right?
It looks like a geometry of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute, Hollywood is on the opposite side of Lesterland.
The next minute they are on the same side.
Suddenly Lesterland allows you to admire that idea of being here.
Could it still be so simple.
What if they really are a matter of geometry, just a question where we allow us to be relative to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to understand the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like the plans of consciousness.
So as we wait for that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction.
Only fiction describes the heavens.
The fiction alone, the invite to the table.
And look at what it suggests) The Lester, the Arab Tom Riley, the crazy Toyona Riley, the same March Prototype.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Burner Allen jumped outside of the Apollo module of the Apollo 11 and turned on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Allah were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective process of it.
The Apollo program was the largest movement in peacemaking times in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including Apollo 1 copying.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
December walked on his surface, the Al-Qaeda after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest one.
So why did they find?
They didn't have a lot of a lot of a break.
Why were they? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in 1960, give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy -- some questions, why the Moon?
Why turn it into our goals?
And you might also ask, "Why do you scale the highest mountain scale?
35 years ago, why fly on the Atlantic?
Why play Rice versus Texas?
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Poetry: For the contemporaries, the Apollo wasn't just a Victoria victory on the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was to marvel to the transparency of the power of technology.
They were because it was great enough to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological trials.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, the penicillin, and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the cops were eradicated and removed the smallpox.
Technology seemed to be what Alvin Tofans in 1970, called accelerating force."
For most of the history of humanity, we can't go faster than a horse, or a ship with a candle ship, but in 1969, the appeal of Apollo 10 to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human will have returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the avatar of the Apollo 10th, and the optimism of the optimism of the power of technology has evaporated to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve like going to Mars, create a clean energy to create a clean energy -- to cure cancer, or to feed global population appear to be intractable results.
I remember seeing the Apollo 17th toss.
I was five years old, and my mother told me he doesn't look at the cow tube called the Saturn Steven V.
I knew that this would be the last moon mission, but I was completely sure I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that would happen to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like if the technologists had been distracted and engineered with trivial toys, things like iPhone, applications and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate the car autonomy.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a partial explanation in Silicon Valley, who confessed that they've created less ambitious companies than those of the years that those of the years that are funded in, Microsoft, Apple and Gene.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the skeletons, in particular, incentives that risk capitalists offer businesses.
Silicon Valley says that venture investment is changing the creation of ideas that are transformed by the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's going wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their point of light without worrying about the risk, they preferred little investments, and they were able to lie that they could go out in 10 years.
The CRIS. They've always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need an enormous capital and which development is in the long term. They have never invested in developing technologies that are intended to solve large problems, because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars required a political decision that was popular and never going on.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources, like sunlight, wind and bottles. Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than biofuels.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price, don't exist.
Now, the technologists and entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treatments will incentivize the development of an alternative energy -- mostly a significant increase in the research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the carbon price.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we'll see a U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technological, they turn out not to be.
We know for time that famines are the result of failure in the food supply.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like horses or systems for storage and support of food, but there will be famines as there were bad governments there.
Finally, the big problems sometimes lead a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war in 1973, but soon we found that there are many different kinds of cancer, some really resistant types of cancer, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The difficult problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we should, but these four elements have to be present -- the political leaders and population must want to solve the problem: institutions must support the solution, and institutions must support the solution -- should really be a technology problem, and we should understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the ability for the ability to solve large problems, and it meets those criteria.
But it's a productive model in the future.
We're not in 1976.
There's no great competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who inherit hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
Overall, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We're alone in our present and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start giving you the widespread ideas that you have about trust.
They are so common that they've become cliches of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a recovery -- there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second one is an objective -- we should have more confidence.
And the third one is a task: we should recover trust.
I think it replaces it, the goal and the task have been being prescribed.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a recovery, a goal and a task that I think gives a more clear idea on the subject.
First of that: why people think trust has declined?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I bow myself to think that it may have declined in some activities, or institutions and that could have escalated in others.
I'm not sure.
But I can go to the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposed to the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are not many evidence of it.
That is, people who were described about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and political policemen, continue to inspire the same definition.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they remain pretty confident, judges, nurses.
The rest is in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen in the street is nearly halfway halfway on the road.
But is this evidence enough?
What polls of opinion record is, of course, opinions.
What else can you record?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifest when certain questions are.
Does trust politics, trust the teacher?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Do you trust the green?
Do you trust the fishermen?
Do you trust the primate teachers?
You would probably start by asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, trust some, but in other people."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to challenge trust differently.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official or function or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain primary teacher I know to give the lesson class, but in no way to drive the school microscope.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could rely on my wildest friend to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives of the way that trust is different, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think that polls are really bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to obvious the good judgment to actually trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I will afford.
I would argue to have more confidence in what it's made of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a journalist of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who devote their savings with the very carefully called Mr. Mathare, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too contained.
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
Conference dismissed or denied with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say that, you say, yes, okay, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment about how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we are obliged to focus on three things.
Are they competing? Are they honest? Are they responsible.
And if we find that a person is competing in people's stuff, and it's responsible and honest and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be trustworthy.
But if, in the contrary, they are not responsible -- we couldn't rely on them.
I have friends who are competent and honest but not to rely on them to take a letter to the post, because they are forgotten.
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see they claim their own competitions.
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent, and responsible but extremely disappointing.
If that is, I still haven't.
But that's what we're looking for -- confidence before trust.
trust is the answer.
Sustainability is what we have to judge with.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all sorts of institutions, professionals, functions and so on, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a party and said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative role that will use the part of it."
And we found the same problem in all our public life, and internationally, that the accountability system that is destined to ensure trust and evidence evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is to tell the work of the people who have to make difficult tasks, like the particles, encouraging them to break the backs, as we say.
You certainly know similar examples.
Everybody, all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more confident, and that things would be different if we try to be worthy of being trusted and we're going to convey people who are reliable and we try to determine whether other people, functional or policies are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the attitudes, which doesn't do properly properly.
Third, the task.
To call the task to rebuild trust, put things upside upside down.
It suggests you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if it's two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in definition, is distinctive, because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough base so they can trust you.
You have to be trustworthy.
And that, of course, is because you can't figure out the general to all people, all the time.
But you also have to make false tests that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That does every day, everywhere, does the common people, the functions, the institutions, very easily.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can give them back without giving explanations.
I take them up and give me the money, or they change them through the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of confidence and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing out is not something very difficult to tell.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is trustworthy.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers, we've been striving to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where imagination can be developed.
This separation has been reducing, and increasingly and more, to the point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computer has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, and if there were no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the ferocious forces against the screen transfers its physical body to pixels.
Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break up the booms.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the hands of your hands?
In the spirit of Michiganda Microsoft district, along with my mentor Caunt Boulder, redesigned the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a transparent view with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, to get into the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with the hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, select them is as easy as holding a book from a pond.
You can bring up the book and restore lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor underneath every floating screen.
architects can explode or rotate your matrix directly with your hands.
In these examples, we entered the digital world.
What if we invest the roles and make digital information come to us?
Surely, many of us will have bought and developed things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual taste on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a mountain mounted in your head or transparent when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical.
What would a future look like?
At the Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Josh and my collaborator Remborne Post, we created this only physical pixel.
This spherical magnet behaves like a 3D paint in space, which means that the computer as the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
Simply, what we did was we analyzed gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and mechanics and detectors.
And when we program digitally the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be recorded and will reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically, and at the distance and the famous image of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planets, physics, and unlike the monkeys or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel very powerful.
But what's most fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world will change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not just show us something but begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without we have to get rid of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a giant for two years in Huntington, China, in the '70s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my mother tiger said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer, like them.
After the Cultural Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only a critical path to happiness, a safe job and well.
No matter whether or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese forest.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must begin to train from very young to learn the acceptances, so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
Until I wrote to the director of school and the present of a radio show.
But no adults would get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends would support me, but they were children, no authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream would never be done.
I feared that during the rest of my life a sense of second class was the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved for another calling.
No one around me wanted to show me to me? Okay.
It turns out the books.
"Bronze Stones: (Clinic Latiture Leaps)
Those who were banned in China, of course.
"The Good Earth."
And it's not convenient propaganda.
The Bible is interesting, but bizarre.
That's one subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a review, "Honey to your father and your mother."
Home," I said. It's so different, and much better than obey open."
So it became my tool to get out of this company of confusion and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And the encounter with a new culture also led to my comparison habit.
It's a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed outside to me because this is what students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
Compassion reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and comparison literature.
Comparing and contrast, it gives academics a deeper understanding of a theme.
And I thought, if the comparison reading worked for research, why not do that in everyday life?
So I started reading books.
They can be treated from people from Walter Island "Janine Adams of David McCartner who were involved in a same point, or friends with shared experiences.
For the crisis, the tensions are economic, political and spiritual trends.
For the Buddha -- it's all psychologists: lust, fear and social stuff. Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
"The path of Chandle Terry" Thomas Merrie: The Road Allegod Path Instead of losing me in the translation -- I found that you can win.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that "life in Chinese is literally "lawyer "law."
And "navigator" in Chinese, literally means "new mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I won't feel alone or impossible again.
Having a destroyed dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have suffered.
I've come to believe that the embodiment is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect us to the place that the dreams come from, where passion, where happiness comes.
Until a destinent dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always putting them out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first plastic client.
I was a PhD student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex came into the first session using sheets and a honor booth, lying at the sofa, my office took the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so lifeless.
My classmates had a paradigm as a first client.
And I became an epiphany that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the joke stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to move the head while we were going through the solution.
"The tree is the new vessels, he said, Alex, and so I saw her right.
You start working on, you get married after it has kids after the death goes on.
For versabors, like Alex.
But soon after, my superstar pushed me to press Alex.
I resist.
I said, "Of course, it's coming out with guys under their category -- it takes a hard head, but it's not like to marry it."
And then my superstar said, "Not yet, but maybe you get married with the next one.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it happens."
This is what psychologists call an Alaska moment.
It was when I realized that the '30s are not the New 20s.
Yes, people feel head after what they used to be used to, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the 20 of Alex were the perfect moment and we were wasting it.
So I realized, that this kind of benign negotiation was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and her loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of the internships all over the place.
There are 50 million pages in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider nobody to get to adulthood.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the investors from here.
Oh, yeah! They're unbelievable.
If you work with vegetables, you love an iPhone, you remove the dream an iPhone, I want to see -- it's good. Amazing.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the keys in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that shape his life will have gone to when they have 30 and so many.
People from over 40, don't panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that will win.
We know that over half the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their 20s and reprogram for adults, which means that if there is something they want to change from themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that persuasion changes more times for their 20s than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to their top at the age of the 28 -- and things become complicated at 35 percent.
The 20 are the time to educate their bodies and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your daily life and common has an impact on the person that will become the person.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our 20s are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the investors are hearing.
The newspapers talk about changes on the timeline.
Researchers call the 20s an extended talent.
The journalists are charged by records like TV and "clicks."
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a trivial what actually is the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Berner said that to achieve large things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Doesn't it?
What do you think happens when you give a head in your head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your life?"
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency.
And then every day, smart vents, interesting like you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my girlfriend isn't good for me, but this relationship counts. I'm just singing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while it starts a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My 20 are to finish and I still have nothing to demonstrate.
I had better crowdsourcing the day I graduated from college."
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes for the 20 were like the chair of the chairs.
They were all rushing and fun, but then at some point around the 1930s, the music broke and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he had 30."
Where are the internations here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but don't worry, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 1930s, there's a huge pressure to the treaties and so many of you start a career, choose a city, choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much shorter time period.
Many of these things are not complicated, and there are research that start to show, which is much harder and more difficult to do everything than the 1930s.
The Cuban Medicine crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
Realizing you can't have the kid you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your child.
A lot of speakers and curves look at themselves, and I, sitting in the room, and talk about her 20, "What was I doing?"
I want to change what the pages are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about what it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emmanuel.
At the 25th, Emmanuel came to my office because he was in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but he still couldn't decide to, so I spent the last few years working as a waiting.
As it was cheaper, he lived with a bride that showed more temperature than ambition.
And despite a few very difficult times, his previous life had been even weaker.
He cried often in our sessions, but then she was getting herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day, Emmanuel came up with his head on her legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new freedom for a director, and he had spent every morning filling her with her many contacts, but then he was seeing the empty space that follows after the words in case of emergency -- please call me ..."
I was at the point of the story when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have an automatic accident?
Who will take care of me if I give me?"
At that time, it cost me a lot of work to resist and say, "Yes."
What Emma needed was not a therapy that really worried about.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the demonstrative decade of Emma went ahead.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all the vegetable, man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma to forget about that identity of identity and get an identity capital.
For the identity of identity, I mean to do something that adds value to his person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the Earth career, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that internal side, of that company that you want to test.
I'm not looking at the improvisation of the invention, I'm describing exploration that shouldn't count, that by the way, it's not exploration.
It's prostitution.
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them tell them.
Secondly, I said to Emma that urban tribes are shipped.
The best friends are great to take the airport to the airport, but the vents that come together with friends with similar minds are limited by who you know about, what do you know about, how you think, how you think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital that new person who will get nearly always comes from outside of its closest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak little friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the investors have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way that they call this group.
Half of the jobs created never published, then to meet the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but you know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as an inventor, Amel soon choosing his family, when he has a couple and a form of his own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose her family had arrived.
You might think that 30 is better age to feel the 20 or even 25 and I agree.
But to choose the person that you live right now or you are now attacked now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards the altar.
The best time to work in your marriage, is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you are.
Pick your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead to do instead of just doing it, or killing time to whomever you choose to you.
So what about Emma?
Well, we went through that principal, and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That supply of work gave him a reason to leave the bride that he lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special organized of events in museums.
This married with a man who chose constantly.
He loves her new career, he loves her new family, and he sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contact are not big enough of it."
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love with vegetations.
It's very easy to help you.
The investors are like planes coming out of the airport of Los Angeles, which go somewhere in the West.
Right before the launch, a slight adjusted in his trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Fiji.
In the same way, at the age of 21, or at 25 and even at the 25th, a good conversation, a good conversation, a good desk, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea of spreading all the pages that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege to say to investments like Emmanuel every day, the trees are not the new 20, they claim their adult, they get identity capital -- they use their weak bond, choose your family.
Don't let define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very powerful job in management consumption for a work that was even more excited: the doctor.
I went to teach you mathematics to seventh degree students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and evidence.
You give them tasks.
When the work went back down, he calculated.
What struck me the attention was that C. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no set of CO2.
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that need to learn in math in seventh degrees, safe, are difficult, proportions, departments, the area of a paradigm.
But these concepts are not impossible and very convinced that each of my students could learn if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivation perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's CO2, but what if we succeed in school and life depends on much more than ability to learn in a rapid way?
So I left the classrooms, and I went to university to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of challenging scenarios, and in every study, my question was, who does succeed, and why?
My research team and I went to the military Miller West Point.
We tried to predict what the strings would remain in military training and who would relax.
We went to the National Country of Deletherh, and we tried to predict what kids would advance the farthest possible in competition.
We study novel teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking what teachers are still teaching for the end of school and of those who will be the most effective to improve the results of their students.
We partnered with private companies, asking ourselves, what of these marketers are going to keep their point of work?
And who's going to earn more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came up with a feature as an important prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't C.
It was determination.
The determination is passion and perseverance.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to their future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon, not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questions of determination and then wait for over a year to see who graduate.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of graduation, even when I caught them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the safety that kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not just in West Point, or at the National National Company in which matters determination. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk to abandon it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how little people know about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethical solution?
How do I keep them motivated for the long thing?"
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them determination.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, it's commonly not related or even related to the talent measure.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination in children is something called "recentless" Men."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. Down has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows up in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to pursue when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger institutions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to embrace, to start all again with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more determined.
Thank you.
Growing in Taiwan as a daughter of a cathern, one of my most stressed memories is my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I marveled this incredible language.
But for a foreigner, it seems to be as improbable as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quick to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academics would understand 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read trees of trial, menus of restaurants to understand the basic idea of websites or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
They open up their mouth as much as they can even be single.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
person.
If the fire form is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting in a fractal way, "Life, I'm bringing." This symbol is actually the original way of the call, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of door door in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
These are building blocks to create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks behind, that's to go."
As the ancient said, two are companies, three are culture.
If a person would stretch your arms, this person is saying "That's so big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is caught.
It's a prisoner like Jones inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees, we also have the forest.
Put a table underneath the tree, we have the specimens.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's an idiot:  Easy to remember, because a tree is pretty intimidating.
Remember fire?
Two fire together, it becomes very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burned.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, purpose.
Three together, those are the showers.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brilliance.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun goes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, is the short of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Touch had anybody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, spacking out.
On the left, we have a female.
Two women together, they're listening.
Three women together, keep care is adult.
So we've gone through nearly 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight radical people will allow them to build 22.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same as a eight year-old Chinese.
So after we knew the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a fire mountain. It's a volcanoes.
We know that Japan is the land.
This is a sun placed with the origin because Japan is in eastern China.
So a sun next to the origins, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character's on the left are two mountains piled one over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile because the Chinese employees would destroy their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the existence has become going out.
A mouth that tells you where to come out is a salt.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down from stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four, we saw the Magellan Magert together.
The film mastered his imagination for months.
Her favorite character was Gland, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic vaccine.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
Now we live and raised our children in a sort of industrial complex of childhood fantasy.
However, the Magellan magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a few years later on, curiously, another film whose prototypes, a metal boy and a hairy kid rescued a girl dressed as an enemy student.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the OECD and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Magellan magician.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the apples.
But I think if the head of Oz was done today, the magician would say, "Kancard, you're the salary of Oz as the profession predicted it.
You use magic shoes to defeat the army generated by computer computer completely.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Magel of Opposit is that the most heroic characters -- wise and even villages are female.
I started noticing this when I made Star Warren to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection, because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second child, and the level of the superstar had gone down.  So he slid up in the room and he was impressed as a mom leg, and he didn't think he understood what was happening, but inevitably, absorbing everything.
I wonder what perception.
Would it be the issues of value, personality and legal?
Would you have the feeling that Luke would join an army to beat the government?
Let's compare this to the October of 1939.
How do you make Dorother your movie?
Making good guys with all and being a leader.
It's the kind of world in which I want my kids to grow OK, right?
Why is there so much capital force F, force in films for our children, and so little from the yellow lines?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies, and they should read it. It's very good.
I don't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that Leonard Prince doesn't provide the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults that is mixed.  I think at the moment of the first baseball, I really hoped that credit would start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is over, I have a boyfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the village and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are lots of exceptions and defending Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they, the boys, are not really their objective public.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how to defend the paradox, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the patriarchy.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real as Heifetz and Kateland, but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all walks continues to appear in classic after classical -- each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends or a man and her son, or two men who believe a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what the critic said when Valentine's going?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a principle.
It's very good. Don't let that stop it."
Well, almost none of these movies go through the Berkeley test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
There hasn't yet been roots and already spread up, but maybe today we'll start a movement.
Alish Becket is a cartoon illustrator -- and in the mid-'80s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be done, in the film, there is more than a female character than have lines?
So we have to fulfill the requirement.
Are these women talk to each other at some point?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid you like?  Right? Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things among each other.
It happens. I've seen it, and I certainly see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good film, Argentina.
Right? Rumbles of Olympic, success of back, a sense of consensus of what a Hollywood movie movie is.
It's virtually not the Berkeley test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a pregnancy where men and women hide during the crisis of reenslances.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this scene, and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "You come to bed bed, honey?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them think they have women's prototypes?
Okay. It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's good.
But there's a bigger number than this is going to disappoint this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says that he's been sexually assaulted in their lifetime.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for kids have something to do with that.
I also don't think the videos of music or pornography are tightly aligned, but something wide, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual advertisers.
Who are those guys -- what are they learning?
What do they not do?
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the violin with violence and then to cover the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not talk about?
Are we assisting that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very random statistics and we want to protect them.
We have tools to our device as a power of power, and we expect that to help, but I have to ask yourself, who is going to be able to be able to protect them if, at the same time, activate or passively -- are we educating our children to keep their male power.
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our children in a new definition of man.
The definition of malaria is changing radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that care care and abandoned.
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character from "Star Wars knew what he responded about?
Okay.
Obama Kennedy and Glamo.
What do they have in common?
Maybe it's not just the glowing dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anybody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories where my son is telling my son, and it looks and more stories where you see that your work is to join a team -- maybe a team that's led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magic of O.K.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for a sea plane on the shores of Maine, because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
They are covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
But over time, I used to look for them.
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me connect them.
This became a passion to find things in a love in love and archaeology.
And finally when I started studying electronics, I realized that I saw my own eyes was not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, I had grown up to one of a thousand miles of length along the Nino.
And my sea vessels had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the infrastructure.
This is a place in the Eastern debt of Egypt called Benki.
And the place, the simple view, seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant rose.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Telascopia, lost for thousands of years.
Steuther was the capital of the former Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the Father, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Eggles have always known that Batmon was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that they built them, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge plankton of aligner.
This area is enormous, it's about six percent per square kilometers.
First of all, the Nile sun right next to the Battle of Titanic, and as it changed over time, it was transferred to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a secular city in a long-term landscape?
Try to find it at random would be the equivalent to look for a needle in a blackboard, with the eyes sold and using baseball bats.
So we use NASA novel data to make a place map, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nile is.
But you can see more detail, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elaborate area that you see within the circle here, which we think could be the location of the Battle.
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing show jobs, you can see it here.
When I say show, it's like the shots of samples in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human happiness.
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of late, we found a dense layer of cell objects.
This means that in this possible location of Battlex, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years documenting from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period we think is Battlethming.
We also found pieces of pedator, coal, car and cat, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop.
This may seem to be not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Middle Ibrahim, these are the stones that were used.
So we have a dense layer of occupation that data from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from an elite ray of elite that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't even find the Boston Titugraphine here, but we'll go back to the place in a near future to localize it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end up with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably was written in Twitter 3,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the voices.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984, D.C.
Make the ideas actually happen in 1984, in a city lost not for a long time and found from above.
It certainly puts the search for marine shell in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of the house.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that he's done.
Now you visualize a group of obese newspapers.
They are racing in a flock of bicycles and they go to their entry doorstep.
I need you to see this really.
They're beating strong, they're sweating, they go out a lot.
And they collide out against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around all of the parts, the wheels that go on to your side, rays of the wheels that end up in abstract places.
In the lobby, the hallway, or what's on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light. The light shining on the Mall of the Galapagos.
It's waving them with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks speech.
You can feel your blue ball by making insulation on your nose.
They can smell the plane of the oats.
They go on one side and train their living room.
In the room, and doing the maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney Spregy.
It's very little clothes, dancing on his center of center, singing Hill Bor Baby On Time Time."
Now give me the kitchen.
The floor has been coated with a road of yellow blocks and from the oven come to you Koran, the Hollywood man -- the Spacecrafts and the Leonardo of Ocean -- the back of your hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place in New York.
It's called the memory Campaign of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, hoping -- I guess, that this was like the end of a superstring superstring.
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different liver habits.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They memorize the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorized entire poems in just minutes.
Compare to see who could memorize the order of a deck of blades.
And I thought, "This is incredible."
These people must be phenomenal.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England, and he has one of the best memories that have come from.
I said, "Yeah, when you realized that you were a bread?"
Ed replied, "I'm not a wisdom.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everyone who involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques, invented by 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used Cinculture to memorize their discovery, and that medieval academics used to memorize entire book."
And my reaction was "Wow." How did I have not heard of this before."
We were standing outside the room of competition, and Ed, who is an amazing English English and brilliant English -- although a little excitement, he said, Josh, you're an American journalist.
You know Britney Springs?"
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney Springs how to memorize order in a living pool in living on national television.
That would test the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney Springs, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something done?"
And that was the beginning of a very bizarre journey for me.
It ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also researching it, trying to figure out how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what your potential might be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called E.
He's a magnetic, very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad he didn't even remember that he had a memory problem, which is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic -- but it was a window that allows to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim Peek. He was based on the role of Justice Hoffeart in the movie "Ran Man."
We spent one afternoon at the public library of Salt Lake City, memorizing baby guys -- was central.
And when you go back -- a lot of treaties about memory written over 2,000 years ago, in the Atarisk and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that there was a time when this idea of having trained memory, disabled and grown was not a thing as bizarre as it can look like today.
So a long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing liberally their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed us culturally, and I would say that they've changed us as well.
We have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last place on our planet where you still have people passionate about this idea of a trained memory, disciplined and crossing is this kind of sense of memory.
It's not so silly, there's competition like this worldwide.
I was fascinated, I wanted to know how these people do these people.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College in London invited a group of memory champions to a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be that it has brains in some way or structure or anatomically different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the rest of it?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control of control that they shared with.
When they put them into a MRI machine, they scan their brains as they memorize numbers, expensive and shoes of snowbacks. They found that in memory champions were lighting parts of the brain, different from others.
They actually used them, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The movement of competitive memory is driving as an armed race where every year appears someone with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must be put a day.
This is my friend Ben Prime, three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of it, there are 36 barbaries of descriptions that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he ate.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,450 different binary digits.
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call "the "special code."
It illustrates with a paradox known known as Bakering Paradid, "Lawyevar says the following: "Levitation says to two people who remember the same word. I tell you, "Remember there's a man called Baker.
That's his shock.
And then I ask you, "Remember there's a baby "aware."
And when I go back later, and I ask you, "Do you remember that word that I told you about a little bit?"
"Remember what it was?
The person who told you that his name is Baxter is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who told her work is battle."
The same word, different ability to remember, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't actually mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship for you.
With all the other memories that dance for his head.
But the word, Bakerabad." We know pandemics.
They use white hats.
They have flour.
They smell well when they come home to work.
We probably know some walker.
And when we hear that word for the first time, we began to put a bunch of passionate storages to fish them easily at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data from 2,500 years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's known as the pale of memory."
The story says like this: There was a poet called Symphonies that serves a banker.
They had hired it as an entertainment, because before I wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring to a DJC, it was hired to a poet.
He stood up his poem of memory, and he got his memory poem and he marched down, and as soon as he left, he went out of the bathtub collapse.
And killing them all.
But not only kills them all, but it destroyed the bodies by giving them recognitively.
Nobody could tell who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't bury the bodies out.
One tragedy behind the other.
So singlers, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, close the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting on every invitation.
I took the family of hand by bringing them to where their loved loved ones were.
What Siemens took at that moment is something that we all know about more or less intuitively, and that is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names, or numbers of telephone or words of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial space.
If I asked you to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Singapores, it's very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to tell who was sitting on the horse in their lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and fold them out of images with things that you want to remember -- the shorter -- the more sculpting, fascinating, fascinating, expensive and abstract to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in Latin, latent.
And how does it work?
Let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that you would have done it to TEDx if you've invited it to TEDx 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're on the doorstep.
And identifying some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely insulten competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house and see the Monterey of the Gallery mounted on Mister Ed.
And that would remind you that they want to introduce their friend Ed Cook.
And then you would see Britney Springs to remind them that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then they would enter the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they would talk about would be that extra journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
That's how the Roman speakers memorize their speeches -- not word for word, that will confuse them, but typically for typical.
In fact, the typical term comes from the Greek "Toyotas," which means "the place."
It's a version of when people thought about the orange and the rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase "first of all, it would be like the first place in your memory hall.
I saw that this was just fascinating -- and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory competition, and I had the idea of writing something outside of this substitute of competitive memorials.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a particularly boring event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting in exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone moves up the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself back in place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem -- or the names of an ancient school ancestor bought in a pure market.
And I found that this was incredibly entertaining.
I would never have hoped to be.
It was entertaining, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is really about doing is to enhance more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, cartoons -- provinces, insurance, absorbent and wave waves, in the observer's eye.
I got pretty much hooked.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
It's a pair of ears and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two holes, because the distribution is the worst enemy of a memory chamber.
It ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before I had the idea that I could integrate in a sort of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this could serve from good elephant for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition, which didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize speeches and numbers of phone numbers, and lists of purchase, but really, this isn't the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they are based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary to be able to build the words of memory or memorize bars of children. To benefit with a little bit of perspective about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate day, but it's not the case.
Great memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we concentrate tremendously.
The palace of the memory -- these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they don't even be true.
They work because they make we work.
They have a kind of deep processing process, a kind of complete attention that most of them don't go through there.
But the reality is that there are no attacks.
That's how things do memorized.
And if there is something I want to leave you today is what E. The anti-participatory I couldn't even remember that he had a memory problem, I left myself to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much of us are willing to lose from what is already our short existence in the Blackberries or iPhone, not paying attention to human beings in front of us, who is walking on our side -- will we be so honest that we don't even bother use to process in profit?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person who remembers to remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years in the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we'll just take a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from St. Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a town called Livington, and this was my bedroom of a child.
On the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony.
And there they all spent the tent. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, they all looked at me, and every time I gave me back and I went back into a towel, they all see me.
And I was like this.
It was bomber, insecure, and hated it.
He hated that journey, he hated that back, hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Listen.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, no division, no division of areas, but of those viscular connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we occupy.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what makes them evaporate, think about power, "stable and democracy."
And I know that you think about it by based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greek.
This is a trick.
It's a disconnect that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, solid soldiers, southerners, in front of the elements, from the elements.
This is very, very useful because building things is terrifying.
It's costly, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who build the urbanism and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use shapes that they know are going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Living Public Library.
But it doesn't have much to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library, shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the plan.
On one side is innovation, the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for current life.
We impulse, we drive and push so much, we get completely removed from people.
All black -- this is depressing us. You think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and come back to connect with those separate symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like translates, and so we started to experiment again, we fly back to the back of the back over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it's over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, we went out of the '70s.
architects were busy experimenting with called Bruce calls."
It has to do with the ants.
That can be adding.
Small windows on a declared scale.
Something really hard.
So we approached the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We put the grid back into the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know we like and we update them.
We add up and add cake and use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give up.
We took Chicago random and turn them into skyscrapers that can be medieval calculating facts.
The shapes were beaten, they gained in car and color.
The elderly became columns in columns.
The costs grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all went through in commercial hubs, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasy.
Those factors could be to the measles, to the French or the Italian.
Potentially with a symphony of bread sticks.
This is what happens to the post-conflict.
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we prescribe memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this isn't the Tasmanian.
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we start making the grid back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called deconstructive denominator.
We dismiss the historical symbols, now we have new design techniques for computers, and we find new composition -- some shapes that are crashing against other forms.
This is academic and embarrassed, and it's super popular. You have totally excluded.
Usually, the prison would fly again in opposite direction.
But then, something remarkable happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Guandam of Bilbao.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Goldman said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when the criticism, academic, and public in general, were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times.
The tourism in Bilbao.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those buildings, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, New York, Cleveland, Spinosaurus.
Everyone wanted one, and George was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible for these forms, wild and radical, how is it possible for them to become present around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and terrorism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the top mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and turbing.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium, with other star architects.
I went to Zahan and Libby, and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go through all the architecture, and the digital media began to increase the speed of information.
They think, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is accelerating, you can take a ship -- an airplane, can be touchpated.
The technology crashes. You can see in the newspapers, on the TV, and at the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communication finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture moves so fast.
It's not a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before you know whether that I designed four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The brutal was not a two year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they were.
That's never going to happen. I think, because we're in the largest threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the ant, the steel or the acceleration, and it's the revolution.
My theory is that when the world is applied to media media -- it starts to spend more and faster, to get to be in both extremes almost simultaneously, and it is effectively drawn the difference between innovation and symbol among us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can do almost instincts with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works.
We were hired to replace this building that was fired.
This is the center of a town called Pines in Fire Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings seemed exactly the finished product, there were no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media -- the building stopped being just a media building, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell their history, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes cortisons with the collective memory, and in charge these symbols.
That is, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those libraries of Living.
If that building was built today, first we would go online in search for new libraries."
We would be bombarded with experiments, of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's menus.
Mencates that can lead the mayor of Livingston, to people in Livingson, and tell them that there's no single response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives rise to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave to integrate by architecture.
That means that the costly place of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Seval can be uniquely and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways they will produce.
That means that buildings.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sport or for degree, or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream on the East River in New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the community unit around that cause is no longer a client.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little bit of laundry, as much as the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more ecological buildings, smarter and gentler buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
Find an architect, control it, and we work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings, not only reflect our society, but they shape to smaller spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we shape our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Steven.
I just went through a year and already started walking.
And it makes it a great way, typical of the children in a year, banging as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that he likes to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and chicken, and it gives yourself those big kisses and sheets.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all your friends do this and my mom tell me I used to do it, and it made me think, "When stopped doing this?
How is it that we suddenly are not about our approximation?
Because, apparently, we don't like.
Every month, 10,000 people Google for Google, "Am I a Beauti?"
This is Facebook, he's 13 years old, and he lives in Denet.
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit.
It's Sunday at night.
It's ready for the next week in school.
It's got a little scary. It's a little confused because, although your momma tells you all the stuff that is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among what her mom tells him and what her friends, or colleagues from school, they tell you, don't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of it and it publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a comment -- "Am I beautiful or am I a child?"
Well, so far, Faiza has received over 13 million comment.
Some of these are so disappointing, that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy teenager, normal and current, who receives these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable lives, emotionally.
Thousands of people are producing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving them to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, speaking, giving me "When I like, commissioning, sharing, driving, this is never done.
We have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's kind of like a party in your room every day!"
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are implanted.
This environment is always going to be connected to our children to engage based on the number of "I like they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and which is manipulating digitally.
What is the most heartbreaking in somebody's life in front of someone in front of what is normal?
And where are they looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are owned from the news of girls now.
So model models keep dominate our panels.
The teapot technique is now a routine now.
And trends like, Aspiral, George, Biblicall and Apple.
For those of you who know it, it means prevention means protection.
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of the sport, and the singers of the sports.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individual individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities and their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not trivial activity.
They are critical activities for their growth as human beings and as contributing to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class. They avoid participating in the classroom debate because they don't want to call attention for their physical appearance.
One in five are not looking at classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season, if you don't think you see enough good enough if you don't think you're lean enough, you'll get a lower note to the average of your companions who don't worry about that of the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, the United States and China.
And they are dependent on what these young people do.
So for sure, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're like.
The low self-esteem on his body is depressing academic performance.
And it's also powering health.
The adolescents with a little bit of automatic activity perform less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, engage in more dieting diets that can bring them to a food description.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily influenced by people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's because of what they make more risky decisions, like alcohol consumption and drug consumption, drug diet, static, sexual relationships to early ages and no protection and damage of self-organizing.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pressing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have greater rates of absorption.
17 percent of women don't present a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way they look like.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that chance?
Liberating this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many well-intentioned programs, without knowing, enhances the situation.
So we should make sure that the program that follow our children, not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programmers are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are points of critical parties for anyone willing to provide an education in body autonomy that works.
An education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires every single one of us to take the rights in the issue and we're a better model to pursue for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good enough to tell the progress of our politicians in hair or the size of your chest or the size of your chest or insisting that determination or success.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not for what they look like.
We can all start doing it by assuming responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we publish in our social networks.
We can praise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When's the last time you had a mirror?
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to change truly our culture, for our kids to grow up to value all their people, valuing the individual, the diversity, the inclusion.
We have to put people who are really dialing the difference in a perished.
We can make a difference in the real world, let's make it look at the ones in the big screen, because we can only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of them, where the way they think they look at will never be tempted to be who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who has in mind?
Your wife?
Would your sister?
Your daughter, your daughter.
Your book? Your friend?
It could be just the woman who is at two seats of distance. What would she mean for her if he was released from that automatic voice inside his interior, which is able to hold her not to have long legs -- more skinny, more delightful, a more flat window, a smaller watch.
What would it mean for that if we did this and we would say resistance to its potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is holding us all.
But let's teach our kids the truth.
Notice that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and why they do, and for how they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk and compare to other people.
And we worked together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that little years of a year today, become agents of safe change of self tomorrow.
Let's do it.
Five of the November 1990.
And I initially declared it innocent. But being pressing for other minor charges, in the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 New York, including tunnels, synagogue and the U.S.
Fortunately, those plains were frustrated by an FBI driver.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, he couldn't help you.
Later, it would be convicted by its participation in that attack.
ESG is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an Egyptian engineer.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, which very few -- even most Muslims come to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there is always a little fraction of people who are terrified so precisely to their convictions that thinks that you have to use all possible means for everybody to live like them.
A few months before the arrest, he sat with me and explained that in the last few weeks, he and some friends had been going to train training in Long Island, to practice.
She told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the California touch pole, without knowing our group, was vigilanted by the FBI.
When I got to pull out, my father helped me hold the rock on the shoulder, and explained to me how to point to the target at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet, I gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise of all of us, especially me, all the objective in flames.
My uncle became back to others and in Arabic, he said, "He said, "He said, "He said.
So father, such a son.
At all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted to put a car caregiver with 700 pounds of explosives in the northern location of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and help another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called it "mammal," which means uncle.
When I got 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood, I didn't let me make a lot of friendships.
And every time I started feeling comfortable about somebody who was time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was a victim victim.
I preserved my identity to avoid the white -- but it will be the new of the class, silence and regulating, it was enough medicine.
So most of the time he spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills -- to say it by sustainable. For growing under facility, it wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was educated to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open up the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put out my way to think, was during the 2000 presidential elections.
In a pre-industrial program, where I participated at the National National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of youthful violence, like I had been victims of almost all my life, was something that felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various productions.
One day, at the end of the conviction, I discovered that one of the boys that we had made friendship with, was Jewish.
I took several days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no anxiety between the two.
I had never had a Jew friend and I was madly feeling proud to have afforded the barrier that all life had been made to me believe that it was unabless.
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job in Bush Gardens, a park of diversity.
I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures, that experience resulted in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that homosexuality was a sin, and for extension, all the homosexuals were bad influences.
For a chance, I had the opportunity to work with homosexual actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the ones and fewer critics that I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy towards the sufferings of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I could contrast the stereotypes who had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be honest, but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the "Give Show."
All night, Jon Stewart made me become intellectually honest about my intolerances, and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my father in a moment where I was desperately needed it.
Occasionally, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, extractive, was not in vain.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something I would think of my heart, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who has suffered with intrinsic dominance and said, "I'm tired of hate you."
At that time, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not Jack Erither.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put me into a risk of risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone day, who is trying to bring violence to violence, can hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- that although I was conditioned to this violent ideology and intrinsic, I didn't get to make me angry.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism against the prescriptions.
I do it for the victims of terror, and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terror, I will talk to those acts of action, as a denial to my father's actions.
So with this simple thing to me here as evidence that violence is not inherently interesting to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there is a film that's projected in your mind.
It's an incredible machinery film.
It's in 3D, and it has a subtle sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a sandwich, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood who are projected to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in the direction.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, T, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know I have a conscience.
I don't have certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't consciously, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal movies.
Why are we not just robots that processes what we have to produce results without experiencing the intrinsic film?
At this moment, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is objective for nature.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost every century, I predicted that vision.
The psychology studied objective behavior, the neuroscience studied the brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Later, 20 years ago, everything began to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pentagon like Roger Pentagon said, "Now it's time for science to tackle consciousness."
And since then, there was a real explosion -- a flourishing of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations, correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kanzi presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science science.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain about consciousness -- the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they are correlated.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscience.
Actually, there are no problems with consciousness.
Well, not to deal with the real central mystery of this stuff, why all physical processes in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does this exist?
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like explosions, like hormones, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical games are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate the employees, how hurricanes work, how they reproduce, they adapt and metabolize living organisms. They're all questions about objective work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomena, how we walk on, how do we talk, how we play chess -- all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy issues.
But the hard problem, is the question of why is it that all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the expertise, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have a lot to say.
I'm a heart scientist.
I want a scientific theory of a studies scientific theory that works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms, which would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we stand at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations, brilliant. We used this physics, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit on this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
Moreover, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of an anomaly, something we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first seem insane, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there isn't such a difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal sub-Saharan movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the objective functions -- the brain behaviors -- and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reduced consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time I left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental circles, space, time and mass.
They put fundamental laws that govern them, like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
In the contrary, they think fundamental, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental goes out.
In the 19th century, Maxwell found out that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, time, time, Latin, New Yearlong -- then the basic laws of the electronics, and I put electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are governance.
I think that's the situation we meet with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, timing, mass, then for the logic question, you have to get the list out.
The most natural thing would be to boost awareness as something fundamental -- a fundamental bridge of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not an object of science.
It opens the way to handle science.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want to do fundamental laws so simple that we can stimulate them in a regime.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can stimulate them on a shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called packaging, "Pantheon for All, psychiatrists per mind, every system is subconscious, not only humans, dogs -- the moons, even the microbes of Rob Kanghama, the elementary particles.
They even have some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or they think.
It's not that a picture can be full of angiogenesis when you think "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow up and smell the roses."
No, so no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling -- subjective, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy.
How did anybody think that crazy thing?
In part, it comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like the others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems illegal, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind looks more closely with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that relate to thinking with physical process, is linked to the awareness of information.
There are always information processing, there's consciousness.
Process of complex information, like a human being, complex awareness.
Process of simple information, simple awareness.
And something very exciting is that in recent years -- a Bionicle Tongo, took this kind of theory and developing it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which calls pilot, which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of pilot, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an average degree of information, just as much significant conscience, degree of very important awareness.
But when you get to the committees, microbes, particles, the chicken degree of paper.
The level of information is lower, but it's not zero either.
In the Tonyghe theory, there will still be a level of different awareness of zero.
In fact it provides a fundamental law of consciousness, high degree of pile, high school of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that package can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers often have noticed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using lots of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of equations?"
From the paleontological view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describes the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of warning.
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, the pandemic vision, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical consequences.
Some can be illegal.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then it must be a vegetarian.
If you're a package and you accept that vision -- you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think you think about it, this tends to transform your views, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences, it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Santa in the movie Health?"
Is it conscious?
According to the view of the pandemic information, she has a complicated information, integrated, so that the answer is, if it's conscious.
So if this is correct, you get pretty serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of intelligent computer systems and the ethics of pushing it.
Finally, you may ask for the consciousness of whole collective connections, the planet.
Canada has its own consequence?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a collective conscience, an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the parts.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that should be serious.
So this pandemic view is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer than the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental -- that of the second that it's universally universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we'll finally go to uncover it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural town in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, I fought my sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She actually hasn't got nothing."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on my mother's mouth, and spent a lot of time looking at the But Batmon series and Dawson Creek."
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we took the disability outside of the equation.
And years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school in Melbourne, just after about 20 minutes in the middle class 11 minutes in the middle class 11 minutes in the class 11 minutes -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when's going to give you your discussion?"
And I said, "What discussion?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of damage for a few good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation speech.
When people in the wheels, they talk about inspiring things in school?"
"By general, in the classroom.
And that's when I realized, this kid had experiences with people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we're not. And it's not guilty of the chap -- that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors.
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage like what I do in this wheelchair of wheels, and you're probably waiting for them to inspire them. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear them appropriately.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to the disability of disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something Mal, A Machine, Michael McQuee.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and it doesn't make any exception.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this message through social communication.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or this one: "Your excuse is invaded."
Or this one: "Before you leave, it introduces?"
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be that you've seen one of the kid without hand drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber police legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term deliberately pornographic, because they rank a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we emphasize disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, to motivate them, so we can see them and think, "Well, for so bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person.
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the story of the number of times that have been bizarre to express that you think I'm courageous or an inspiration, and this happens to before my work had a public profile.
It was like me to wake up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is cooking.
These images are changing people with disability in benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns.
And life as a person disability is actually something hard.
We overcome some things.
But the things we overcome aren't the things that you can think about.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use term "solo people, deliberately because I subscribe to the so-called social model of disability that tells us that we're more disability because of society we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the ordinary.
They're just using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to do that in the way we do it, by sharing those pictures?
When people say to us, "You're an inspiring source that says it as a complicated.
And I know why.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this message that disability makes us exceptional.
And honestly, don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here by plugging the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, Steven, aren't you sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
I learned from other people with disabilities.
But I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
And I learned that this is a great idea to use a few blocks of barbaria.
Wonderful.
We learn from the strength and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that develops and it confers us.
I really think that lies that have sold us about disability is the biggest infusion.
It makes us difficult life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude, the reason that that's lying is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smile to a scale of stairs has never done that it becomes a radius.
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a book and raising a positive attitude to convert all those books to the brilliance.
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching Buffet the Save Space doesn't consider anything for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we're happy to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genetic achievement of people with disabilities. And I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 degree in a high school school in Melbourne is not a little surprising that their new teacher is a wheelchair user users.
Disability doesn't make us exceptions, but question what you think knows about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football?
And what is the average speed of a gang without charge?
Unfortunately, today just respond to one of those questions, so please don't disappear.
When people really think about increasingly, he thinks of "Minority Report and in Tom Cruzeiro by putting the hands in the air, but the reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the adult reality?
The first step, is what I wear is: Google Glass.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google Glass.
I'll let you experience what a professional computer is in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run through the game of the game to 100 miles, blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels a hundred pounds of 110 pounds to us, trying to tell us all of his being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's nothing pleasant.
I bring some videos to show you what Google Glass.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the Presciporate practices, because the idea of NATO technology is a submarine coming up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris Klum, go.
It's awful to be taken off.
A moment. Let's zoom in.
Prepared Preparis?
Go!
Chris Klune: As you can see, it's a protection of what it is to be taken in the football field from the perspective of the tape.
You may have realized that people are missing, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, cortex at the University of Washington.
March marketing."
Blue 8, Blue = On."
Chris Klump: This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at NSA.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players -- and they have asked me on YouTube and on Twitter and on Twitter -- "You can see from the angle of a field of the field.
Or from a route?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we get out of it, how do we bring it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called Occup Ritten, which surely many people already know.
The Rick Rick has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to keep playing. No!
Oh, my God." Oh, huh.
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain fearing for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we record a video of Adam Peter crossing the line, coming out of a tablet with arm before running and making an anti-all? What will be the experience of a fan.
When can Masa be Mescuner running down the ball to the bottom of the network? Or Federating a journey on Wi-Fi.
What will be their experience when it comes from a mountain to more than 100 miles like a sponsor scheme?
Maybe they increase the sales of diapers for adults.
But this isn't really augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, R.C.
How do we achieve the augmented reality, Rix?
We will take the augmented reality when the trainers, the marshmallows and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it for patients?"
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a brief clip about technology at NSA.
In 1965, the Pattern Pattern Potts put a monitor to his field to play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, NASA put radios on the streets of the field of field and then in the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2003, imagine that you're a player coming back to your group and you see his next player shown in front of you, in a plastic view that you wear putting. You won't have to worry about forget a players.
Or to memorize strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they miss parties, and they hate to lose games.
If you miss parties, you get fired as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But it's not just a manual strategy manual.
The augmented reality is also a way to gather information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view of the people who are underneath.
You also get information from the seals and the accelerators, something that's already working on.
And all that information send it to your players.
Good teams will know sending it.
The bad ones will have information of information.
This will differentiate the good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your records and the analysis analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It will be also for departments. Who would have imagined this?
What would it be like?
Imagine that they're the field of field.
You get the balance and the return.
You look at an open receptor of a receptor.
Come to the protection area.
Another flatter asks you to be an open receptor.
Get the bullet down, but they melt.
And the bullet loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in his view an area of iron that shines and can modify the career.
It's approach, trapping the balloon, running and antidote.
The public link and fans have followed the play from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion, in the game.
Making lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
The augmented reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality regulating?
Are we going to use it just like bread and circles, like our homeland entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, to be in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports lights.
It generates billions of income per year.
But how much does this technology be worth?
How much this technology is worth?
How much does it also for a Commandment Commander or a Neil Derek Tseeper trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than terrorist notes and Karajans?
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, depend on, as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retire after 23 years of service at the High Pattern of California.
Most of those 23 years I spent them painting the southern end of the county of Mario.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Goldman Gate Gate was open in 1973.
Joseph Strawberry, engineer chief to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test suicide.
The suicide from the bridge is no practical and not probable."
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped away from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two towers will bring it to another dimension, this bridge has identified as such, so each one of your concerns and pain, and the water that goes down under your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one drop of four to five seconds, the body hit the water about 120 miles per hour.
The impact break bone, some of which they plant vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that are not normally retired in the individual water and then they drown out.
I don't think that those who are contemplating this method of suicide to realize the matriarch of death that they face.
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches from parallel steel.
This is where most people are starting to stay alive.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darker moment, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked to an officer by hiding his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successfully that day to bring it back on the bank.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We struggled to channel the way through these calls.
This wasn't just a bad service to those who are contemplating suicide, but the officials as well.
We've traveled a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new officials.
This is Jason Garbagu.
I met him on July 22 of July, last year when I got a call from a possible woman sitting on the verge near the center.
He said, and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to a gold of the Goldman Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had fly over here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had fly over here two times before New Jersey to try to get suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason and asked us if we knew the story of the Pandora box.
I remember the Greek mythology. Zero created Pandora, and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, Never. You never open up that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
They came out plagas, pins, and all kinds of bad versus man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no hope."
It stopped some instants, it was tied to the right, and it left.
This nice guy in New Jersey had just taken away the life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family of the family called me to see how he was.
The parents of Jason had been asked.
The satellite damage of suicide affect many people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved out alive?
What would you say?
You know what to say?
In my experience, there is not just to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not arguments, claps, or say to the person you know how it feels because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the point of inflection that you need.
If you think somebody is suspicious, you don't have afraid to cope and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: Others in similar circumstances have thought of finishing your life, you've had these thoughts?"
To confront the person in front of it can save life and be the point of inflection for them.
Other signs to look for despair, despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be improved, impossibility, believe that there's nothing that you can do about the thing: social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he is with her permission and blessing that I read them.
"Hi Khhere: Hello. I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go through the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty quiet, but I notice more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from Petro to San Francisco to see the 14th to her father on his father on January 19.
It never got there.
I called the Petro police and repeated it as disappeared that evening.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported me that Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it from the bridge at 1850 in the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before wrong without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
GWP, the Goldman Gate Gate is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cement.
Good luck this week, Vick."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk along the way her son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man where I mean hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I responded to a radio call for a possible subject in the sidewalk of the northern tower.
I drove my bike, and I looked at this man, Kevin Bertie, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, I grew up the railing down, and it stopped into that little tube around the tower.
For the time and a half later, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day to go back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came back, the happy.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What did it happen to do and give it to hope and another opportunity?"
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I'm listening.
You let me talk and just hear."
Shortly after that incident, I received a letter from the mother in Kevin and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read it.
"Dear Bridge, nothing will erase the events of 9/11, and you are one of the reasons why Kevin keeps with us.
I think Kevin was calming for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness.
I adopted Kevin when I was only six months, completely unaware of all those habitable traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order.
We thank God for you.
It's dependent on debt with you, Narrator: Brad Bertie."
And at the end she wrote, "PC: When I visited the General hospital of San Francisco that night, you would figure out like the patient.
"I said, "I had to solve it."
Today, Kevin is a loving father and an active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that his story will inspire others.
The suicide is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was suicide with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, steal the opportunity to meet it.
This is what the suicide does.
For most people, or those who consider suicide, they would not think of giving another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Usually, this is only about three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and sounds of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents I have been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other one was a man who talked about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand on three times.
At the final shop, he looked at me, and he said, "Lever, sorry, but I have to leave."
And he jumps.
Horrific absolutely horrifying.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge, they don't suffer.
In addition, those few who have jumped out of the bridge, and lived and can talk about it, that one or two, most of those people have said that the second they left the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect Marilyn with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be striving to do.
The suicide is preventable.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question is showing you, how did you become that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt I had finally achieved the dream that I had had from a child.
My outside finally matched my inner truth, with my homeland.
For complicated reasons, I will be referring later, when I look at this picture -- I think, "Get it, you got it, you got it.
But last October, I found that I'm starting to start with.
We all wipe up our families, our religion, our society, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of liberation, to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those who are surrounding us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered acceptable.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, my agent, my agent, is ignoring my story.
I think this magnet is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was registered as a kid at birth because of my genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always took this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you take that t-shirt in your head?
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl!
I knew how to shape myself.
Gender has always considered an incurable fact, but now we know that, really, it's something more complex and mysterious thing.
Because of my success, I never dare to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be bad but because of how the world treat those of us who want to liberate it.
Every day I appreciate to be a woman.
I have a mom, pop and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a little Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There is a Hindu god -- diabetes of the shoulders.
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries to celebrate.
I was in front of stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me: This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15.
It's the director of a brain beat competition.
That night she said, "Why don't you participate in the business behavior?"
She told me that if I participated her and she would take care of the insect of the insurgency and the vessel, and that night, he won the bathroom suit, he won a galaxy suit, and he was left with over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of the regions of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was a king of beauty of beauty of transparent women, but I can.
I also met the god of devilencers, especially when we traveled to remote provinces of Limbah.
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was resistant.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm spreading.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a real reason beauty."
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know, if you move to the United States you can change the name and the identity of gender?"
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I would put it to my name.
She also accompany me when I was in Thailand.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand.
At that time, in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity of identity means being able to drive or power to get a breakdown, but for me it was the license to live, to feel me.
Suddenly my fears saw minimum.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move me to New York, and be models.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman Alic Networks.
A young woman in New York who would casually live his truth, but that disappeared, he put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rate is eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of us in November do a global flu for the Common Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who fought and stood to influence.
These are Marshall P.C. Johnson.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, exposing me so that someday there is no longer 20 of November.
My deeper truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Karess Schulp: Gene, a quick question.
Gene Rocket: Sure. You see, first, thank you all my banking.
My support network, my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I have asked young women to come, which I think, and sometimes when they called me and tell me that their parents couldn't accept it. I took the phone and said, "Mommy, can you call this women?"
Sometimes it worked, another one. It's just identity of gender, that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we are all assigned by a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the theme that sometimes that advertisement doesn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to authenticate people, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transportation movement is starting to match the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should be understood.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many patriarchal societies, the parents usually are known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter, and I'm proud of it.
Malawi started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007, and when they had been homeless in 2011, when he found the National Peace Prize of peace, he became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humankind, the story of women is the story of injustice, of inequality, of inequality, of violence and exploration.
You see, in the patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when a girl, your birth doesn't celebrate.
It's not welcoming or your father or your mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her convictions to mother and no one's happy father.
And a mother is overwhelmed by having a child.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, he gets excited, and with the hope of a son, when he shined his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother suffering, but the daughter -- the newly night daughter, when it grows, suffer as well.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admits his brother.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can get fun.
It can play with his friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, it opens out of her house without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns out to be called her father and her brothers and her family and her family, and if it carried the code of that assumption of the honest, it could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumption code, not only does the life of a girl, also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the honest.
And there's a norm more of the patriarchal societies that are called obesity.
It's supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very subtle.
It's the critic.
The model of a good girl must be quiet.
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of her father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly -- even if you don't want to.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like or if you marry it with an old man, you have to accept it, because it doesn't want to be a little bit of disappearing.
If you hunt it very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, call it disconnect.
And what happens at the end.
In words of a poet, "The house, the beat, and it gives birth to more child."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, include the same lesson of obesity to his daughter and the same request of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
And dear brothers and sisters, when I was born Malawi, and for the first time, trust me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, trust me, I felt incredibly honored.
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and she was fascinated with a legendary fight of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malawi, and he called my daughter like that.
But when I left, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, "Law.
And when she grew up, when she grew up, when I was four and a half years old, I admitted it in my school.
You will wonder, why should I mention a girl at a school?
Yes, I should mention it.
They can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developing countries, but in poorer countries, in the slums, in the tribal societies, it's a great contribution for life of children.
In a school, it means the recognition of their identity and their name.
An admissions to school means it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks earlier, when I was looking at the Canadian vision form, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the spears of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and my daughter.
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I have tried onscreen in her personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Malawi.
I've made all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for empathing.
I taught my daughters, teach students, to forget the lesson of obesity.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the soldier called the head.
Young brothers and sisters, we were fighting for more rights, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we meet a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It's called talking.
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use candles and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were silent, the little girls and the singers killed them.
They were supporting millions and few talking, and it was scary to have those people who kill and touch when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, Malawi got up and lifted on the right to education.
He wrote a paper for the BBC blog, he was offered herself for the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And her voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread like a classroom around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine of 2012, they shot up in the head.
It was a data for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was debating between life and death, I whispered the ear to my wife, "Should I blame myself through what happened to my daughter, your child?"
And instantly he said, "Please don't blame you.
It's defending the fair cause.
You put your life back to the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter inspired yourself and joined you.
Both were on the right way and God will protect it."
These few words meant a lot to me and I didn't ask myself again.
When Malawi was at the hospital and had severe pain pain and strong headaches, because her facial nervous was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that spread on my wife's face.
But my daughter never complained to.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smiling smile and my face.
I'm going to get good. Please don't worry.
It was a consumption for us, and it consumes us.
And dear brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist the most difficult times, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women and women -- it's like any girl of 16 years.
He cries when he doesn't finish his task.
She fights with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there in my tutor that has made so audacious to Malawi so valuable, expressive and embarrassed?"
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was opened from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group.
Having said this, there is a stigma, when you stand to a brain function.
Are you still just as smart or not?
If not that, you can be intelligent?
After the neuron, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormone and neurotransmitters.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from over a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix mix chemicals, and try to get them, to keep alive.
More than once I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of experimenters, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the optimal doses because there really doesn't exist.
I started testing with different mixes -- and I was surprised to see how little changes in the doses changed dramatically my automation, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case for a few months, I tried dose and chemical chemicals for a man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts changed.
I was always fat, I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past, I have known a number of times in the past, and I have known several times like this, or maybe some very tight versions of it.
It turned out like an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be a contractor.
In fact, I was trying -- a lot of inspiration, fix a problem that I had on the front, and just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dose.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go through -- since then I get better at men.
What I was trying to achieve. When I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the operation, my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think of almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point, how do you get those mental images that I use to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want to testify new ideas and recreating situations and recreating situations.
This kind of thinking is not new.
Philastorms like Human, Descartes and Hobbes, see things in a similar way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who are questioning this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works. For me, it's simple -- for me it's simple for me, it's simple for me, for most of us, for most of us, for most of us, for most of us, to most of us, mental imagery is critical for creative thinking and invention.
So after several years, I get to find the right point and have lots of great mental memories, really video, well sophisticated and well structured.
Now, I'm working on how to take very quick these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie filmmaker would be able to use your imagination just to steer the world that has the front?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments made by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image for functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain; you can see the brain scan done by George Gans and her colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The average column shows the scene of the brain of that same individual as it was invented, seeing that same image.
The column on the right now created the contents of the central column on the left. You see that difference is almost nutrient.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image, and imagining, seeing that same picture is almost normal.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is from Jack Gallery in Berkeley, California.
They made the brain waves in recyclable visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it was showing people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were scanning their brains to create a great return of brain reactions in the brain sequence.
And then they showed a movie with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as they recorded a new scanner.
The computer using only brain information in the scan decided to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the deforestations of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us backpacks.
We're pretty close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, it creates in the brain the same map.
This led to the brain scan systems available today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution, a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we achieve it?
There are many techniques.
One is to open up the skull.
I don't offer myself for that.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques of projection for images, including me, telling us with the recent result of the MRI -- first we should ask the following, "Is this technology going to be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but to this point, larger magnets just offer small improvements in resolution -- not increase for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- let's do better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different regulations, like making a spiral.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make real magnets really, right?
However, most recent advances in regulating solutions and brilliant solutions in code and deconstruction, in translations and radio frequencies in the systems of MRI.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, we use magnetic patterns attached to radio rating frequencies to radio frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the IMF, we can increase the information that can be extracted on one stage.
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the MRI we should be able to measure not just the fluid of organized blood, but the hormones and neuroscience that I've mentioned, and maybe even neural activity directly. This is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly by thinking directly?
What would we be able to do?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is huge.
These are big questions.
It would be released to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's.
We have a little bit more choices to open up this doorstep.
So anyway, take a year, happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have a lot of arms.
Your closet may be telling someone for the first time or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have through in life.
Everything is a difficult conversation, and although our themes can vary tremendously.
Makes fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked at the South Side Wale Canala, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the light military -- I won't go through my armpits, quoting the letters of Anna D like a letter.
And I will be understood that by the time of my short pants and I had adopted my head, I would ask myself a little boy, I would ask myself a little boy, "Hey, are you guys or boy?
And it would be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I would take my jaw a little further, I would take my latte.
The father would increase the newspaper, and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I would say anything, and it would be into the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time I'd say something.
It would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
Are you a guy or a girl?"
A family silence -- but this time was prepared and was about to go into the female issues at the table.  He had the quote from Betty Friedman.
The quotes of Gloria Steinberg.
Even one of the magnets of the bum that I would show.
So I breathe down, and I went down and down, and I looked at my back a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at me what a challenge for a feminist failure, just a girl with a question: Are you guys or boy?
And so I breathe down, I got out of cycles near it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a clothing clothes, but I'm a girl, and I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink gown, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more than the kind of girl of a comfortable picture."
And that girl looked at me, paying attention, and said, "My favorite pigeon is purple and has a fish.
Can you give me a pandemic, please?
And that was it. Just "Ah! You're a girl.
What about the pandemic that I called?"
It was the easiest conversation ever ever had.
And why? Because the girl in the pandemic and I, both of us were honest with the other.
So like many of us, I've been living in some of my life, and yes, often my walls used to be a rainbow.
But in the darkness, you can't know how color are the walls.
You just know how you feel living in a drawer.
That's how my closet is not unlike yours or yours or your own.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons why to get out of my closet was harder than coming out of his, but this is the thing: The hard is not relevant.
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to somebody who has been declining on a broken bank is harder than to say it's been entertaining?
Who can tell me that this story that counts is harder than to say to your five years that you're going to survive?
There's nothing much difficult, there's only the difficult thing.
We need to stop classified what is difficult for us to respect to another person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our arms and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in arms, and they can make sense security, or at least more security than the other side of the doorstep.
But I'm here to tell you, that no matter what your walls are made, a scholar is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and high heels.
It was not the military lesbian prepared to fight any four years to enter the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, curled up in a corner of my dark closet pushing my cat grandmother, and moving only a muscle is the most frightening thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers, that I've spent my entire life trying not to disappoint them, and now the world would turn back to purpose again.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't launch that grandmother, you will kill you.
One of my most memorable farmers was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that it was gay, and when I did my lab ladies work, in my black dress and taxes, I walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents' friends, people who knew me for years ago.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women I love "Marting Land!"
And the gay story had begun.
"Would you ever be in the Catholic?"
"Well, yeah, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San Francisco."
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's fabulous!
"All do you know my anti-appearing Asian?
It's very good and you've never talked about having a boyfriend.
"Ashhi, what's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grack and Grace.
And you know who loves us? Jackson.
Jack is our favorite."
And then a woman, disconnected, but waiting for her support, to make me know that I was on my side -- finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink changes."
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the grenade laundry.
Surely, it could have been easy to indicate where they felt.
It's not very difficult to find them and figure out the fact that they were engineering.
And what else can you ask for someone, but to endure?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how attractive you get.
That's how hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have quit.
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Chicago of the Pants.
Now, please see this through gay perspective, but they understand that what it means to get out of any anger is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
Keep the armor. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have a drug, but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want somebody to be a geneticist, the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct. Just give it -- you can tell it.
If you know you're gay, tell it.
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more importantly,  leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You just apologize for that.
And some of them can get hurt wounds, forgive for what they've done, but they never apologize for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of them will be disappointed, but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you meet in a armed dark pushing a grass, you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very similar, but they are.
Thank you, Gould. Enjoy the veil.
Intelligent, what is that?
So if you look at the story of what the intelligence has been seen, a productive example has been the famous quote of Eden Deconstructor that "The question of the question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim nothing."
When Edison Dickens wrote this as a criticism to the pioneers of the computer as Alan Turing.
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a walk.
First start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or the Earth's negotiation or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very bizarre effect.
Of course, as a terrorist, we know that the reason that we're trying to save ourselves to ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that doesn't have any concept about Earth's intelligence on Earth, you'd see a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that manifest the surface of an uncanny planet just stopped doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I announced a variety of themes through science, through several disciplines that read, I think, to a uniquely underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally adjusted for development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in robotic motion, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different themes and putting them together, I asked, for several years later: Is there an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different ideas?
Is there just an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to one and a half percent of the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an assertion that intelligence is a force, F, which act in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep open choices, with a force T force, with the diversity of possible future, accessible, yes, to an impending time for the future, the top.
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to stay carrying.
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining open options.
And so in mind this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How predictable is it?
Does the level of human intelligence?
Does artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the surprising applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research has suggested that the universes that produce more destruction, or "control for their life should have trends to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that technology connection between entropy and intuitive intelligence is a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior doesn't only correlate with producing entropy production, but actually arise from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called Entrophy, designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system that is found.
Amazingly, English could spend multiple animal intelligence tests -- play games of humans, and even earn money to trade action, all of it without having been told to do that.
Here are some examples of entropy in action.
Like a foot human, we see Entrophy balancing automatically a post using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave English a goal.
I just decided to balance the position.
This ability of balance will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate from extremes of a string at the same time to liberate food, here we see that entropy can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
It's widely applicable to a variety of dominants.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game against itself, illuminating their potential for play.
Here we see Entrophy to orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly disconnected and maintains successfully the right net.
This same carbon network capacity also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see English organizing the routes of a barcode flower, discovering successfully and using the Panama of Panama to expand globally.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense issues, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see English spontaneously discover and run a computer strategy -- sell in a simulated series of actions of stock, successfully increasing assets under its exponential gesture.
This risk of risk risk will have wide applications in finance, safe applications.
Alex Willis: What you've seen is that a variety of memories of human human behavior such as tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of the decline of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony here.
Let's go back to the beginning of using the robot, the work RF: There was always the concept that if we developed intelligent, there would be a cyber rebellion.
The machines would be lifted against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that perhaps all of these decades, we have all the concept of cyber rebellion to the winter of the universe.
It's not that machines first become smart and then menstrual and trying to get out of the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
I often ask myself: How do you look for goals to get away from this kind of frame?
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or help them understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process trying to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a point of inflection in human history, something between the skills of stars and losing the planet we call "the home."
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Nepali mission of NASA has discovered thousands of planets that orbit around other stars, which points to Earth is only one among billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the light intensity of the stars when planets go ahead of them, and block a little bit of that light that we get.
The data picked up by Kepler showing the sizes of planets in addition to the distance of the distance there is among them and their mother star strategy.
In ensemble, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rare as planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they receive from their own.
Instead, this gives hints about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this winner of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is falling under the weight of humanity.
The year 2013 was the hottest record.
Glass and ice ice that have been with us from millennia now are disappearing within decades.
These environmental changes that we've inflicted on the global scale have suppressed our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a scientific scientist, no astronomy.
We study the habitat of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that looking for alien opportunities in the engineering sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the quest of life in the universe I can tell you that the more looking for Earth-like planets to the Earth, the more enjoying our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the planet newly discovered and the planets we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor to our neighbor. Mars.
Mars is tiny, little rock, and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world showing this by a mission like Kevlar.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our rovers like Curiosity tracking its surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit the orbit, like the MTV mission -- take samples from the Martian atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose his hardware.
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But despite all these marine images to remind us to the desert of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with the vast ideas and panic, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the desert areas of our planet who still have to colonize -- places really exploded in comparison with Mars.
Even in the denser places and the farthest land on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen extended by our tropical forests to thousands of kilometers away.
I worry that this excitement for the colony of Mars and other planets show up with a great and sad shower -- the implications and the belief of some that Mars will expect to save ourselves from this fragile abstraction of the only planet we know that is truly hardwired, the Earth.
For a lot of the interplanetary exploration, I am deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will get us to place later on the wild.   Thank you.
But the goals for the interplanetary exploration and the land is not contradicted.
No, they actually are faces of the same concept: the goal of understanding, to preserve and enhance life in the future.
We have extreme environments in our world as alien pandemics.
Just get closer to the house.
If we can understand how to create and keep living spaces, in hostile and initiative areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment.
Many years ago, the European physicist Fermi said, considering our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life extraction so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Ferring is that when civilizations, they become technically advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important they protect the origin of the planets that made this development.
It's arrogant to think that just the interplanetary colony will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and international exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to supply the highlands of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve Earth's habitation on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where they had left them.
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and they were all pretty well closed.
I thought I would call a car, at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a closing could take a long time to get, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I was thinking about my passport and my ball.
It would be expensive, but I certainly sure not more expensive than a corner in a half night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I went out to stop.
I'm a professional neuroscientist. I know a little bit about how the brain works.
Cortified Liberia that increases heart rhythm, model the levels of adrenaline and cloudy thinking.
And when I got to the factory show, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleeping.
And I started wondering, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in place in place that prevent bad things happen.
Or at least if you happen bad stuff, you measure the probability that it's a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but to a month later my thoughts didn't cry.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny Kanjan, winning from the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed told him that he broke the window, and he had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called proportional response.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written this a few years earlier, known as the loan.
You all know what the post-conflict is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what was wrong, right?
In the protester, as Danny explained, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, next, try to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize harm.
So what I want to talk to you is of some things that we can do in the form of a prize.
Some of them are evident. They're not so obvious.
I'm going to start with the obvious people.
In the house, defining a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis -- based on how our spatial memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, that location the low-hanging trees, where the friends live and enemies.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes on in London taxons.
It's the part of the brain that allows us to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the smell of the shocks and they still find their nuts.
They didn't use the supply, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move, not so good for things that are moving.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, gangs of reading and passports.
So at home they have a place for the keys -- a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For his passport, a particular fall.
For their reading glasses -- a particular message.
If you get a place and you're searching with it, your stuff will always be there when you look at it.
What about travels?
Pick up with cell a picture of their credit card, driver's license, passion, send it by email for them to be in the cloud.
If these things miss or steal them, it can make assumptions.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases cortified.
The cortex is toxic and entertaining thinking.
So part of the practice is recognizing that we are not at the best time, and we have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps no more interesting situations than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a being loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this grows up as a prosthetic decision of medical decisions and actually for the decision of financial decisions and social decisions and social decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take that you would benefit from a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the outcome of the lab and the colony is a little high.
Everyone knows that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that to have high cholesterol is not the best thing, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the colony, a statue."
And you may have heard about the statues, and it knows that it's one of the most accurate drugs in the world today. It's even likely that you know people who take them out.
So you think, "Yes, remember the statue."
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistics that you should ask for most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the NSA, the number required to treat.
And what is this, NASA?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or a surgery to a surgery in any medical procedure before it helps a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistically miserable statistics is?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not do something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a dock of the doctor, and if it's guilty of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We have not really understood the underlying mechanisms.
But the estimates of the Clapping that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number required to treat the most widely recovered, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This leads to the research of cynical researchers and Pamela Harvard, confirmed independently by Bloomberg.
I myself explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack.
Now you may think, "Well, one probability in 30 to lower my colony.
Why not?
But then you should ask for a statistical statistics, and it's "Here's "Here's "Here's "Steven of the Stock effects." Okay?
For this particular medicine, the secondary effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things: dramatic pain and articulate pain and artificial pain, the scarcity pain, but now you think, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still make medicine."
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how they do this over time, so they don't have to make the reason for reasoning in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped you, five percent of the 300 have high effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that help you help your drug.
I don't say they had or not take the statue.
I just say you should have this conversation with your doctor.
The ethical ethic requires it, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to treat is pretty typical.
For the surgery that is more done in men in the 1950s, expression of prostate per cancer, the number required to treat is 47.
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has helped the help.
And the secondary effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include the impact or erased exchange, uninventing inconvenience, regret flag, federal inconsume.
And if you get lucky, and it's one of 50 percent of the effects just for a year or two.
So the idea of the printer is to think before the questions you can plan to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change from opinion in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happen at that moment is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator -- it's not necessary for the digestive system, or the library or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react with fast. They could get the lunch of lions so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window for those moments of stress is rational logic, like Danny Kanzi and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to train to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all deterministic.
We're all going to fail every moment in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those failures might be, to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent things to happen in the first place.
Recording at night in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractors installed me a computer clock next to the door, with a key to the door door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit, I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered -- and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not really organized, but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Piano, "Pook is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing solemn.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a partner on the score, you need to play more subs.
Two painting, even further.
Four, extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a ship tree there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of people can have never come to a complete silence.
That's my definition of silence: a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system, the ALS, in addition to a little bit of my own story.
And the French language language came up in the 1800s, and over time, it mixed with local signs, and it developed the language we know as ALS.
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
Sound is a very important part of my life, really, in my mind every day.
As a person who lives in a world of sound, it's as if I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, constructions, behaviors and norms without questioning them.
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my alphabets and they amplify the sound.
I learned and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned I can create sound, and I've seen how people respond to.
So I've learned for instance.
"Don't take the door."
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the potato bag of chips.
"Don't error, and when you're eating it, you can make sure you don't get the covers on the plate."
This is all called "Sustaine "labor."
Perhaps I think of the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super vegetarian from sound.
And I'm always waiting for the sound, which is for coming next.
Out there, this drawing.
ADHD.
TBP: Of course.
TED, for ads.
You can see that the press doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle and male bars.
In the deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for "scholarship at the ALS.
A typical press has five lines.
But for me, to make it to my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galaxies, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called me the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has entered my art of art.
Is it going to distance more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a tactile way, or experience it, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and integrate it into my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and unveil it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was attached, it was a little bit of a person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could tell myself and my artistic work, or I could empower myself.
I chose it to be empowered.
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with many different interpretations of ALS.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be listening.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by borrowing their voices, I am able to keep a temporary way of value something like to take a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I wasn't going to continue to continue with this practice, I feel that I could fade into oblivion.
So with sound as my new artistic medium, I deepening in the world of music.
And I was shocked by seeing the similarities between music and ALS.
For example, a musical note can be captured and expressing in paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept at AIDS.
The two are very special and highly shaped, which means that subtle changes can affect all of the signs and the sounds of sound.
I'd like to share a piano metaphor, so they understand better how the ALS works.
So imagine a piano.
The ALS splits in many different gradual parameters.
If you add a different wall for every finger as you touch your piano, like facial expression, the movement of your body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and like that, as you touch the piano, English is a linear language as if you put only one degree at once.
However, the ALS is more like an account, you need 10 fingers in a similar way to express a clear concept or an idea at ALS.
If only a headline would change the acceptance, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens to the music in terms of pitch, bone and volume.
At AIDS, when you use these different gravitational patterns, you can express different ideas.
For example, the sign of the street in that."
This is the sign in that."
I'm seeing you.
Looking at slowly.
Oh, I was hooked.
Oh, huh.
What are you looking at?
Ah, good.
So I got to think, and if I look at the ALS through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could be as a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of day," the sun goes out and it turns out.
This is all day."
If you repeat it and reduce the speed, it visually looks like a musical piece of music.
All the day.
I feel that the same can say from "The night."
"All night.
This is all night in this picture.
And this led me to think about about three different types of nights: "Nine, "The night --  "The night."
I feel that third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time at ALS and how the distance to the body can express changes over time.
For example, one hero.
So the first example is a long time time."
Then "step off, "And "All the last one and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at once, "Once "Once ..."
"Time is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per capita.
But when I see the word "manual" that I think automatically at the same time."
Look at MD: Hands right hand.
We have the penguin through the head and the chest.
He said, "Make, cat flag time -- "Marco Company -- "My face -- I'm going to show you a way called "flat Battle."
Can you do it?
All with the hands on high.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like the chest.
Yes, very good.
That means "mental in the international system.
The international system, as notice, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs worldwide.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means "clash at the ALS.
Now, the third one. Please give me again.
And again.
It's Limburg at the ALS.
We're going to do the three together.
"Mama, "clash" and "lighting."
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. But they convey very different meanings.
It's incredible to see how the ALS is alive and thriving, just like music.
But today, we live in a very autistic world.
And just because the ALS doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to begin to figure out what social value defines and allow the AIDS to develop its own value, without sound.
And this could be a step to make a society more inclusive.
And perhaps people will understand that they don't have to be deaf to learn ALS.
The ALS is a rich test and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open up your ears to open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Dennis Katzharaz: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can summarize it, but then you have to clean it."
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or an ignorance bubble I should say, because adults lie to protect us from the awful truth.
As I get older, I learned that adults also come up and they are not very good at cleaning the other ones of others.
The time happened, now I'm an adult and a citizen teaching in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we wipe up the beaches -- and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't give it.
It's sad to say that, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic now.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big banks and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we classify them, and we collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous boat.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong.
We started building this message of work with astonishing height for children to be able to participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electric tools are pretty cool and safe.
Exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collected the plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragile.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every kid and try to combine them into something we hope that works.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we will only gather information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this plastic -- kids are excited with robots.
Then we create quickly what we call "a prototype."
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended before lunch.
And we transform light lamps and web cameras, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor while the computer in order to process this picture and measure the size of every particle to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this invention step on a website for inventors called "The Institutes," hoping that someone else even further.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my local problem. But my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, it turns out the internet, and they played this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in Sunshine, the largest mangrove rainforest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that babies drink is the water in which they are based, the water where they hunt, the place where they live.
You can see as well as the water is brown -- the mud and the oil are also in brown color and when everything moves, it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called spectrum, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a prototype of a spectrum that can draw through all sorts of substances that produce different species, which can help identify what's in the water.
We take this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem at a distance -- I saw forced to make a second experiment -- and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a simpler problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that there were several giant waves, called the tsunami called tsunami, and those tsunami destroyed several cities on the East Coast of Japan.
Over 14 thousand people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fullipone, a nuclear core nearby.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons, are still leaking from nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by 1773.
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the supply of Fukushima everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've come back to Fukushima every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course, we didn't bring them, the parents didn't allow it.
But every night we report the control center, you see the use of different machines here.
It could seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they will have to live with radio-construction their life.
Together with them, we discussed the data collected that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the entire and so on.
And to do this, we create a rudimentary robotic map of the region around nuclear power plant.
We created the evaluation, we introduced pigment to represent data in real time of radio, and we sprinkle water to simulate rain.
With this, we were able to notice that radioactive dust was filtering from the top of the mountain to the river system and dropped into the ocean.
It was an approved estimate.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear core to date.
We came up to 1.5 miles away from the nuclear center -- and with the help of fish in the area we were collecting sediments from the marine milk with a search tracking as we invented and built.
Here we see a progress: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit as small as we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the largest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, on optical biology, basically can be constructed from all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the children of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: Accessible. Acceleration.
Happy Harry: We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For instance.
Or can we help in the mobility of the advanced age of advanced age transforming its standard wheelchair in new electric vehicles in new electronics?
The plastic, oil and radio-construction are terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth, because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So, scientists, designers, sound, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two strands of the design of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the silk silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organism.
One is implicit on the environment, the other thing creates it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo.
The film was only a Michelle Angeles.
But living creatures are not filmed.
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we bring all the information for every cell to work and to replicate.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by roots of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have discussed a world made out of parts, looking at the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects as self-reporting parts of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find nature's material stimulus in nature.
Think about the human skin, for instance.
Our facial skins are delighted with slightly disappeared.
The skin skins are thicker with little blocks.
You act mostly as a filter, the other mostly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same skin -- there's no parts, there's no shock.
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation of elasticity.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architects to work currently between the bottom and the gene, between the machine and the generosity, between the machine and the growth, between the sandwich and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right, analysis and synthesis, is shown on the two screens after me.
My work, at its simplest level, is trying to unite these two visions of the world, pulling away from the sandwich and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, "Why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they congregate four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four camps, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scale, large scale, like this robotic arm with a 24-year-old accomplishment with a vascular basis that someday not very far away to print entire buildings and graphs to nanotubes made genetically modified microbes that shine in the dark.
Here we have reinvented the film, a archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is unique to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility to create a layer and a flag. This was for a fashion advocate from Paris with Aris Van Harley. It's like a second skin made from one piece of time, randomly running around the contact, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and flow 3D with no seams between the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines stiff material and soft in the resolution of 20 microseconds.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CAD scanner.
That designers have access to this high-tech, high-tech analog and synthetic instruments allows us to design products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at a time, comfortable and also that absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator -- my collaborator, we went back to nature to inspire us, and when we design this pressure pattern, it becomes sustainable.
We perfuse this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in redefining, complication and color correspond to pressure points in the human body.
The surface of the nature, it would vary its functionality not by adding another material or another sandwich, but shipping continuously and dramatically the material ownership.
But is it the ideal nature of it?
Is there no parts in nature?"
I wasn't raised in a religious Jew home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible, and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she says, "In the third day of the creation, God saves the Earth to grow a fruit of frustration."
For that first frugal tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and fruits.
All the tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, cortex, workshops and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if the objects were made from one piece of piece?
Will we go back to a better state of creativity?
So we looked for the Biblical material, the kind of material tree with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant biopsy on the planet is called a car called the rain, and about 100 million tons, produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, shows and marriages.
We thought that if we could synthesize their properties, we could generate multicellular structures in one piece only.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal marketing.  We asked a bunch of shells of shrimp, we killed them and we produced the marine password.
By taking the chemicals, we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and open, to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures in large scale, it built a system with multiple bulldons of extremely controlled extraction.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material three feet long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, it stops them dry to find a natural way to contact the air contact.
So why are we still designing plastic?
The air bubbles that were a superconductor of the printing process was used to contain photosynthesis microscopes that appeared for the first time on planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we have genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly carbon and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that do their transition without problems of service to bad, and if it broadens even more, to windows.
A frugal tree loaded from frustration.
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms on the planet with abundant water and a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade, put in the sea, will feed the marine life, and placed in the floor, will help grow a tree.
The adjustment for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep life for international travel.
To do that, we should master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the periodic table, we did our own table of elements: new forms of life created computer and built in a computer-scale way and increased in biological form.
I like to think about synthetic biology like liquid liquid, only instead of becoming precious metals -- they synthesize new biological functions within very small channels.
This field is called microcredit.
We perfuse our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothing, they combine two microcontrols.
The first is the college.
It lives in our oceans and the water streams.
And the second, E. Colony, the bacteria that you have in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other consumer consumption and produce useful biofuels.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To keep these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help that flow these bacteria and to alter their way around.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, preserving the properties of the material according to the functional function.
If we wanted more photographs, we were designing more transparent channels.
This particular digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our thin gut.
And here it is, as a primate at TED, our first potential photography, clean links with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shelley said, "We are creative creatures in fashion -- only half is done."
What if the design would cause the other half of it?
What if we could create structures that increase life alive?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, they would repair the damaged tissue, and they supported our bodies sound?
Think about this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, there's always to go back to nature.
Now, you know that a 3D printer prints material on layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
It grows, Again.
This cable capsule, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home in which it is married.
The manufacturing is not about this level of sophistication.
It does it by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different concentrations in different
An act as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, bringing those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is learned in the environment, creates a transport structure, and then it starts to dilute a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the comparison, the two forces of life, manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we paste a small magnet to the head of a silk worm -- to the hill.
We put it into a box with MRI sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the silk worm of silk worm.
However, when we put silk worm on a flat park, not within a box, we realized that it would blow up a flat cocoon and still make it more metaphorically metaphorically.
So we started designing different environments, different advertisers, and we've discovered that the form, the composition -- the structure of the cocoon -- is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often get rid of silk worms to death within their caps, their silk rips and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these plants we can shape spider silk without a single capilla.
They were marketing sandwater, and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a ice robot making silk plates, and we put ourselves into our site.
We knew that silk worms to darker and cold areas to darker and cold areas -- so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or open, to block the rays of light and heat, distributes the silk worm on the structure.
We were prepared to get the organizers.
We asked 65,000 worms of silk to a silk farm online.
And after feeding them four weeks, they were prepared to dilute with us.
We placed them carefully at the bottom of the scaffolding edge, and as they collide, they were crushing, they put eggs, they put eggs, and life begins again, like us, but far, much lower.
Buckminster Fuller said tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
A biological silk of biological silk on spider robotic silk, they give all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, 65,000 worms of silk are thrown 65,000 kilometers.
In a curious symmetry that's also the length of the silk route.
Polaromas, after the electronics, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 papers in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk silk through a robotic arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers should unite these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back up, of course, at the beginning.
Here it is to a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a design inspired in nature to an inspired nature in the design, which demands of us, for the first time, we can make sure of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be of more?"
If they had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time this?
They can show them with toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be of great?"
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be of more?"
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had too much.
At school, I liked the English and the matters and the art and developing websites, and then I would play guitar in a gang called Telecomic Frankenstein.
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of abuse, this feeling of this is no longer a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I am interested in something else, something completely different, and I dive into it, and I let me absorb and I feel "Yeah." I have found myself, and then again, this point where I start to rediscover myself.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to get into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all of this in a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, I would deny all my other passions and refuse me to rediscover me.
Another reason I caused so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong about this, and something bad for me to not define myself for anything.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or to be dispersed or being a shot or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I'd like to have raised then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it, they learned it from culture.
We know what you want to be of great?"
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares.
It's considered a naive question to provide cute answers in children like, "Be an astronomy or "be "a ball or "I want to be painting!
They investigate the Hallowet disposal here.
This question takes us over and over again as we grow different shapes, one -- axis, students high school students ask them to be choosing at universities.
And at some point, "What do you want to be of great?"
It turns out to be the cute exercise.
Why?
So while this question inspired kids to dream with what they could be, they don't inspire to dream with everything they could be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things -- even though well-intentioned adults will probably laugh and say, "Oh, what nice, but you can't be architecture of violin and psychology.
You have to choice."
This is Dr. Bob Chile -- and he's a creator of violin and psychopath.
And this Amy Night, publisher of a magazine turned into an illustrator -- company, teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they will have to choice.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life focused on is very identified in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real voice, the idea that each of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who isn't connected in this way?
What if there are many different themes that wake up their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a multi-consumption.
A multi-consumption is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a backpack to say.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple, potential and day.
You can also use other terms, you can use the same idea, as a retrofittooner, a reconciliation.
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was good at multiple disciplines.
Barbara Shermer refers to us as "scholarships."
Use any term that you like or invented one of your own.
It seems to me as a sort of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the multi-consumption as limited or woe that you should sell.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three multicellular superheroes.
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the intersection.
Shannt Hawking and Rachel Bike expressed his interests shared in cartilage, visualization, visual visualization, travel, math and design, when I founded Melcow.
Mescurd is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry.
And Shanghai and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his ecological mixture of skills and experience.
Innovation happens in the interactions.
There are new ideas.
And the multi-touch, with all their backgrounds, can access a lot of these points of interest.
The second multinational superpower is the rapid learning.
When the crowds are interested by something, we go to it.
We observe everything we can have in our hands.
We're willing to be printed, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort zones.
A lot of skills are transferred to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start out of zero.
Sonny Dune is a full-time journey and written independent.
As a pianist as a pianist who was a personal ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest machinery ever known.
Before it became a writer, it was a financial planner.
He had to learn the finest selling mechanics when he started his practice, and this ability helps him write compelling launch.
It is rarely a waste of time to devote to what you get to you, even if you finally approach it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have anticipated.
The third multinational superpower is adaptability. That is, the ability to transform anything you need in a given situation.
Abe Captain is sometimes direct of videos, other design design, sometimes conductors from Kickstarter, sometimes teachers and sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James Bono.
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because he can take diverse roles -- depending on the needs of his client.
The journal Faso Company advocates adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and unpredictable that are individuals and organizations that can live to satisfy the needs of the market, the ones that really will thrive.
synthesis of ideas, rapid learning and adaptability: three skills where the crowds are very habitable, and three abilities that could be lost if they're prepared to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster the multicellular ones to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multi-consumption problems, and we need not conventional thought to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They came out of the belly.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are squeezed from a specialist and a multi-consumption machinery.
The specialist can dive deep and put into ideas, and the multiplexing provides an explosion of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are signaling with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the multicellular people in large part are given to them to simply be more like their specialized partners.
Once said that, if there is one thing you take out of this talk, I hope it is this: recovery with the internal cord, whatever it is.
If you are a heart spectrum, then special for all the media.
That's where you will give the best one.
But for the multicellular people in the room, including those who have just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, reconnect with their many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those coal markers.
They explore the interactions.
Embracing our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, morality, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In 1991, a woman named Australia led to a psychiatrist in Francisco.
And he would argue and he couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alaskans.
All of you didn't know how to help August, but I would see for her until unfortunately, he passed in 1906.
Behind her death, Alaskan did a self-organizer and found weird plates in the brain, of a guy who had never seen.
Even more startling.
If I had been living today, we couldn't afford it to be more helpful than Allahs gave him 14 years ago.
Allan was Dr. Altos Alzheimer's.
And Audience Determin, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
Since 1908. medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infection, many treatments for cancer, anti-provisions for HIV, state for the cards and so much more.
But little has been programmed in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade ago.
So I think of this all the time.
Alexander now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million people, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the chance to contract Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their golden years with Alzheimer's or helping take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's.
In the U.S. alone, the Al-Qaeda care costs 200,000 dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
So today is the most expensive disease -- and its cost provides an increase of five times in 2050, as we age the generation of the baby baby.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the 10 leading causes of the world around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't prevent, cure or even slow up your development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research of the same way.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research than in Alzheimer's research despite the fact that the Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know about, but everybody should say, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, all of us, including scientists, confuse Alzheimer's.
We think it will be sitting in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with an Alzheimer's patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to denotation a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage of the brain caused by Alzheimer's reducing life expectancy and it's always fatal.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of August a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places on paper that are blazing.
And when it folds well, these sticky dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots are left on the outside.
This makes protein molecules to stick with each other, forming groups that can form large plates and volcanoes.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge, trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are many steps and the idea of what step to block is complex, like developing a bomb.
To cut a cable could do anything.
Correct the others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocks it, and then create a drug.
Until recently, most of them have been reduced and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, geneticists, chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematics.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened by testing these drugs in glasses.
These are the healthy glasses, and you can see that they move normally.
These guidelines, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that are blinded with each other within them, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that they heal and live normal life.
This is just a positive initial resource; but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 141, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's. We need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to know that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we try, we can beat it.
In the case of other conditions, the patients and their families have lifted more research and exercise pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legalizers.
That was essential to advance in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to sell cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims, the caregivers of their loved ones day and night, are often too often too anxious to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Al-Qaeda is not in most cases a genetic illness.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like August, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
Help me talk for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the Column of New York Times in January of this year.
To fall in love with, do this.
The paper is a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I tried it myself.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers, are turned to make 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of examples of this.
Number 12, if you could wake up morning with a quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 10: When was the last time you cry to another person?
And alone?
As it advances, these are more and more personal people.
Number 10: This really likes me -- "Tell your partner what you get from it, or she -- I know very hard tonight, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I hit this study a few years ago, a detail really appealed to me, the child that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but from then, it was also intrigued.
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect me to love.
However, we fell in love, and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Mola Modern a few months later.
That was published in January and now it's already, so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, Are you going to follow them together?
And the reason I think you care about this is because I've asked myself this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the paper was published, it was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I was forced to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can get hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagining that my articles at the New York Times would probably achieve a few thousand views.
And that made a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he went, I had no idea.
The paper posted online a Friday at nighttime, and already the singer, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday, they had called me the Todd Show and the God Morgen America.
In one month, the paper received over eight million views, and I was like, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing on its own significance of love experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or write, what they did every day for weeks, they asked the same question: Are they still following together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search in the bank of my email with the phrase, "Are you still following together?"
And several messages appear immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and asked it.
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman shout up to the stage, "Hey, Mandela where is your native young name?"
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the investigation of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have broken lives.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary paper for San Valley, who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said "no" to every request that we both did a public approach together.
He recorded television interviews, and records the requests of the photos of us two.
I think it was afraid to become a fear of becoming the investors of the programming process, a range for which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: I mean, if I was able to produce permanent love, not just an adventure, but real love, love love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt about, especially people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if we were to keep together or not, and also say it?
If the answer was not, I would ask the experience of asking these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the goal of researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for present processing between college students, using what Aron called the personal personal operation, progressive, and replacement.
Sounds romantic. Right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer to do it, and several studies were also used later Primitive Army Royal as a rapid way to create trust and interaction among strangers.
They have used it between the police members and the community, and they've used it among people of political ideological ideology.
The original version of the story, the one that I tried last summer, which combined personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little university of liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and told me with shift, I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed sorry about it.
I said, I mean, you love you with the person who you did it?
Well, he made a pause.
I think she just wants me to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friend?
Did you feel that they did better know about testing the study better?
The sentence.
So it worked," I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I hit the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was especially all my adult life, and he was my first love, and I had no idea how or if he could live without it.
So I went into science.
I investigate everything I could find about romantic love, and I hoped that that could sort of hit the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought only researching for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought if I was armed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more related.
I have more confidence to demand what I look for.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than they can reasonably help me.
What I look for love is a garage, not just to be loved today and to be loved tomorrow, but to keep being loved by the person I love.
It may be the garage that people wondered when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to fall in.
There may be a way to get some of the implicit risk, and this is a very appealing story, because in love makes us feel miserable, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that says, still follow together?
And his content with a yes or not.
So more than a question, I would argue that we ask more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are complicated, and how do you know how to cut and distance?
How do you live with uncertainty.
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love anybody.
So if you want the short version of my relationship -- this is this: a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we love it, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But love is not the same thing to remain in love.
Umar is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper I wrote, love didn't happen.
We stay in love because we take the choice to be.
And I get a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed that choice.
We didn't consider how many times we would have both of this decision to make that decision, and how many times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before it will always choose me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and respond to 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous and kind, and fun and have expressed that choice on the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what I'm looking for, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the final impact on the title of my item, which is the only part of the paper that I actually didn't write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he will love to love me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbians in full mountains, and in a way, I became a government in the forest.
New York City a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'm going to start with eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and a ball of a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example, how we eat spaghetti spaces.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace. Because here I am, 30 years later and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in Hawaii -- I like to go from exclusion and drink and all those things -- and I was doing a chocolate for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a sort of calculated socks to the Arab Agent style.
Well, my mother is scared to bees, and it's allergic to them, so I add more resin in the canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, it happened: somehow it seemed to increase the size of size, like you would look at the text with a magnifying lap.
So what did I do? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, bizarre bottles that I was going on on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate and tell stories about these objects.
So I set out to draw around the objects, and I realized that my gosh, my gosh, I can draw in space.
I can flow down, draw the same way around a cave in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of special specimens.
First of all, the bank -- you can make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the residential layer.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my bride to dinner, for example, to go to Silyne.
It was great, man.
At some point, I was interested in human form, sculptures of natural size with drawing of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing, meant to me.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on glass layers -- similar to drawing in a window, then in another window and another window -- and it had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the resin.
So I did this for years, and my work closed with something very big, which I call "trafficking."
For the tragic I inspired myself in the garden of Hispanics Boston -- which is a painting at the Missouri Museum in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the tragic." I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Fifteen meters long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, there is Jesus and the laps.
There's a cave where all these creatures are traveling between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation to this analog mesh infrastructure where they hide.
So this is where the creatures with animals of animals are headed to the face, listened to the lists of the later, listening to mass in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised from thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a car.
Bill Graham is in the sea, the Horsean -- the Horsean -- the Hydrogen platform of the short -- the Walker strike -- there's all sorts of weird things that you can find if they look very well in the ocean.
So anyway, a kind of a manufacturing.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it sucks oil in a hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like balloons and it seems to be a mythological being that keeps Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a sense of the trajectory."
It's a little bit a storyteller.
That's the hand that I spoke.
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a trap, like a bird period, and you spit clouds out of this trap.
It also has a five-meter tail of a sea tail that binds the trajectory."
Anyway, his tail grows fire in a volcano.
I don't know why.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ends up in a classroom of click clip made from 1965 terrorist cards.
Have you seen it?
They did in the 1980's, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Pretty late at his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, one is called psychologists."
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material be exclusive, dictionaries.
But each act acts as a kind of file in a way of being human, and traveled in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they get together, they split.
And you can walk between them. It's taken me out.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the head. There's the chest. You can get the inside.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest.
It's a quick passage of these works, because I can't explain it for a long time.
We have layers -- you can see it.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this bizarre statue station.
There's a little forest scene inside the right city.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called Pine World.
Inside this box there is a physicist, a neuroscience, a painting -- a painting, a music, a magazine, a radio, a radio, a radio, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
We have the box and all the people in the chicken with each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're redefining who's and the box you're living in.
And together, we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same material and the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with dulliponity and genetically all we're going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when it hurts.
They take an aspiration.
But so that this pill has the effect against pain, first of all, the intestines and other organs.
I'm going to take a pill, it's the most effective system and the most effective system for any drug to make any effect on the body.
The disappearance, though, is that when you translate it any drug disappears.
And this is a great problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take anti-sponsors drugs, they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in blood, and increase the concept of CDC cells.
But they're also known by their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time they take out to the blood, they will dilute and worse, and worse even for the time they take up to their fate, which is where more importantly, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph gangs, the nervous system, the lungs where the virus is inancial and it doesn't easily enter the blood of the patients that are subjected to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
But after the disruption of treatment, viruses can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with current drugs that is a lifelong treatment of life by administrative life.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Could we get the treatment directly to the department of the virus, without the risk of dilemma of medicine?"
As a scientist expert, the answer was in front of me: Lesters, of course.
If they use in organizer, for the care of wounded and surgery of diabetes, they can be used for anything unimaginable -- including the intellectual transportation of medicines.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes, which open up and closing nearly the cells infected with HIV to introduce drug medications.
Maybe they say, "How is that possible?
We send a little bit of a laser bolt on the cellular mammography infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug.
Before you can even notice. The hole is replaced immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or places in Petri, but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that possible? You can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three-stranded device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make an increase on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, leads to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an insect that distributes the drug distributes, releases it directly at the site, whereas the laser is used again to keep open cells again.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV/AIDS research in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not statistically, armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or military.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting up.
My goal is to understand better to these general agents of violence and study ways to encourage violent participation to violent nonviolent struggle.
I do fieldwork in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost everything conflict, because war has changed.
It used to be a device between states.
No.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, from the 2160s peace agreements between 1975, and 2011, 1960, they signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we should understand these groups, we can even engage them or defeat them in any concept of successful conflict.
But how do they do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons they fight, how they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and policies are not armed to relate.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, no much less defeat them, without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the Hebrew Lebanese, known by his violent facility against Israel.
From his creation in the 1980's, Hebrew has also established a political party network, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Hallmarket, known by their suicide attacks against Israel, also administing the Gaza Bank from 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting away.
They're multiplexing.
They set up a complex machinery of communication stations, stations of television, online websites.
And here they have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published.
The armed groups are also investing in a complex recording of funds without ships, but by reconceiving business business, for example, business companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their fund, to collect better and build their brand.
The armed groups do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they have hospitals, they put into a professional training program or a micrograph.
Helender offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state doesn't bring up: safety and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a steady Afghanistan on the war or even the beginning of the Islamic impulse, can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at the armed groups, we just think about violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hobbed.
They grow because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, they participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, the less we can categorize them as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like Helvett?
They mastered part of a territory -- they manage all their functions -- collect the trash -- they manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebellious group?
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is IDEO?
The lines are depressed.
We live in a world of state, of nations with no state and habits, and the weaker.
This is important for governments, because to counteract these groups will have to invest more on not military tools.
The gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and consider peace.
If we understand better to armed groups, we'll understand better how incentives to offer to foster violence to non-violence.
In this new device between states and non-state actors, military power can earn some battles, but not give peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that cow of security, to fill that cow of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are really very remarkable, but I fear that embracing the feminist tag would be unfair for feminists.
I'm a feminist but pretty bad.
And therefore I am self-confident as a weed.
Or, at least I wrote an article and a book called "The Bad Feministing" and then in interviews, people started calling me the Feministing Mall.
So what it started as a personal joke to myself and a deliberate development, has become something larger.
Let me step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at 20 years old, I had weird ideas about the feminists, these furry women, angry women with men and they hated sex -- as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women treat women worldwide.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people when they insisted that it could be female.
It will be tagged as a feminist was an accusation.
I was scared as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that rebel woman, until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
At the time, as I was growing up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminism, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are fertile." Women are equal to men.
We deserve the same sound for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free or violence.
We have right to use easily and accessible the contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for legislative control or volcanic doctors.
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about women's needs.
We are not just women.
We're people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexual connectivity, social condition, skills and so much more.
We have to realize these differences and how they affect us, the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evidential, but to be clear -- I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drove to work, I hear rap music by bringing up all volume.
Although the letter degrade women and defined me deeply, the classic "Salam Shakespeare of the English Man is incredible.
"Make it reality with your wet bakery.
Perfect, dancing, move till you get the copy."
Think about it.
Purpose poetry, right?
I'm completely driven by my musical taste.
I believe firmly at the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  -- all the domestic tasks, but also kills insects -- the back of junk and maintenance.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazine and beautiful things.
I can see the Balkan and the Romantic comedy, and I have absurd fantasies of the fairy fairy stories that are done.
Some of my offenses are more described.
If a woman wants to embrace the speed of his husband, it's their choice, and I'm not who to judge.
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children, accept that choice, too.
The problem isn't that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is made up so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they choose choice.
Let's solve this problem.
And the conventional phenomenon that has ignored or devoted historically the needs of color women and hospitals and transgendered women, in favor of white women, heroic class and high.
Listen to, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist female.
There's also the following question: as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put discarded feminists in a perished.
We hope that they want to take care of perfection.
When they give us disappearing, we retire them very much like the same person where we put them.
As I said, I am a mess. I consider myself from that period before they try to get me there.
Highly women, particularly the innovators and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be labeled as feminists.
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a feminist for fear of what that tag means is not to be able to fulfill the little realistic expectations.
Let's take Beijing for example, or as I call it, the God.
In the last few years, it's a declared feminist female.
In the video of the video of 2014, at MTV, I was in front of the word "Fling Feminism."
It was a magnificent show, to see this star star openly embracing the feminist and to know women and young men who will be female is something to be proud of.
Given time, cultural critics started intense debates whether B was or not exactly female.
They were rating their feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and a half.
We demand perfection of the feminists, because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much considered a lot.
We go much beyond the sense of sense and constructive criticism, to deflect the feminism of any woman, destroying it until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our imperfections.
If I hear degradation music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy by providing an open-ended supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs.
It's certainly hard.
Why does her music have to be so small?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify that makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my niece, three and four years.
These are two wonderful girls, decisions and bright and too brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
Where you have strong creatures who are.
I think of them, suddenly the best option is visually visible as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sports -- the Turish of Trees.
We can change radio emission when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the movie somewhere else when movies don't treat women as well as decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like bag bag.
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a enough number of women, both to participate and make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your advertising, or your organization is more inclusive, with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are suspicious, but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to deny to be inclusive, until more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision people.
Since we're not memories with these efforts, without adopting these positions -- our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of value and hope that our decisions get to the top, to people in the power of directors and papers and music, CO2, people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting change and significant change.
We can also claim our feminism, well, bad, or any given up.
The last line of my book, "Mall Feministing," says, "I'd like to be a bad feminist to not be at all."
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, mostly because it was my voice stolen and the feminism helped me to get it.
There was an incident.
I call it incidental to cope with what happened.
A few kids donated me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
They steal my voice, and then I didn't dare to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to write.
I grew up in a stronger version of myself.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little bit dangerous, another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humble reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope you can all be a little bit brave, when you need such a value.
Right after Christmas last year, 123 children in California, they had a measles in California, or for being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infect over 100 kids in Hebrew.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with a weakened immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases.
There's an effective vaccine against this for over half a century, but many of the kids involved in the Dishon Disneyland had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly even worse, autism.
But a moment, not the article that was unleashed about autism and deployed vaccines, deployed and marked by being a fragile fractal by the British Medical Brother?
Does not create the majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines put their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare illness.
The few psychologists and pages that I had heard about it creates all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the projections of prevalence continued only three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990, the numbers began to shoot up.
Research organizations like Autist Spielberg are automatically referred to autism as an epidemic as if it could tell someone else in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the U.S. Defense Development Center what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases as "cartoon disciplines and a better detection of cases to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't dissipate a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks at the face of her two years, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be able to fit, why were they so steeped at the beginning.
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s.
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with slow progress and cartoonist in science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how he discovered, but that story turned out to be false and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Lee, Leo Kannett, at the hospital Johns Hopkins -- in 1973, Kanzi published an article that describes 11 patients who seem to inherit private worlds, navigating people around him, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their hands to their faces, but they were pressure of the penisel for mentalities like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of the patients in their clinic -- Kanzna speculated that autism is very strange.
At the 1950s, as the primary authority of the world in the topic, he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as it collected the references of places as far as South Africa.
This is not really extracting, because the Kansas criteria for autism diagnosis were very restrictive for autism.
For example, it meant to give that diagnosis to children with convulsions, but now we know that epilepsy, it's very common in autism.
Once he had been taxed that he had turned to nine of 10 children sent by other doctors to her consultation for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kanny was an intelligent man, but part of his theories weren't cute.
I classify autism as a form of child psychologists caused by cold parents and disappearances.
These children, he said, have kept carefully in a refrigerator.
At the same time, though, Kannett noticed that some of her young patients had special abilities that are clustered in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 synapses before they spend the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite discomforts, he correctly said, "Welcome down."
But Kanni had a bad opinion of these skills -- claims things like kids were simply regulating what they had heard their parents who were paid, desperate to earn their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the theory of Kanzi that autism was weird.
Long Winsbon, cognitive psychology, thought that the theory of the London mother in Kenya was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and affected, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Susan.
Lord and John knew how difficult it was to raise a girl like Susan without services, no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic kids and their families, Lord and her colleague, Judaism Gold decided to do something that should have done 30 years earlier.
They conducted a study of autism in general population.
They pioneered a suburban from London called Cambridge to try to find autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the Kanji model was too limited, because the autism reality was much more colorful and diverse.
Some kids could not talk at all, whereas others were imprisoned in their fascination for antibiotics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of reality.
In the other way, these kids didn't fit in nice and stuck boxes as Judaism, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the monkey model of Kanzi would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How no one had no perception of these kids before?
But then Lorraine found a reference to an article published in German in 1994, the year after the paper of Kanzi -- and he was forgotten, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kanni knew about this article of competition, but he avoided to deliberately mention it in her own work.
There was not even a translation to English -- but luckily, the Marine San Lander talked German, and he translated it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans Apple, who ran an integrated clinic with an internal school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The idea of Apple for kids' teaching differences were hardwired even for contemporary standards.
The morning in her clinic started with kinds of exercise with music with music, and children follow their games in the evening.
Instead of blaming the parents to cause autism, Aspender described as political disabilities.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger calls them their little teachers, and it was dedicated to help in developing methods of education that were especially suitable for them.
And fundamentally, Asperger saw autism as a diverse continuum that had a surprising variety of donations and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they've always been seeing aspects of this continuum in architects known in pop culture like awkward social scientist and the description professor.
He was beyond even to say that, for success in science and art, an approach of autism is essential.
Lord and Judy found that Kanzi was wrong that Kanzi was wrong that autism was infected, as well as parents were the causes.
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the U.S. Aspen Association to expand the criteria criteria that would reflect the diversity of what they called an autistic spectrum."
At the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into voice, sustaining the limited model of Kanzi by a wide and an inclusion of Apple.
These changes didn't fall into a little bit.
Unfortunately, when Lord and Juliet worked between batteries to reform these creatures, people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out of "Ran Man in 1988, only a little circle, entrepreneuring by experts knew what autism, but after the inconvenience of Dusla Hoffeart as Rayan Babbage's and the recognition of "Ran Man with four awards of the crash, pediatrists, psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I should no longer have a connection with that little Circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of "Ran Man changes changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnosis began to explode, just like they predicted Lord and Judy, they were actually expecting that to be outside, getting people with autism and their families finally get support and services that were deserved.
So Andrew Whitopia came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. A simple, powerful history and a credible story as bad as the Kansan theory that autism was incredibly infected.
If the current estimate of the prevailing center of one in '96 kids in the United States are in the spectrum, it's correct, the autistic is one of the largest mining groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to refuse the idea of the puzzles for solving for new medical advances, acting term neuroscience to celebrate the variety of human cognition.
One way to understand neurosurgery is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows, doesn't mean it's broken.
According to the autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distributed, obsessively social, and it suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
Seventy years later, we're still reaching Apple, who believed that cure for the most intriguing aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employees with ability, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Joseph Zakes once said, "We need all the hands on cover to address the ship of humanity."
As we navigate towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to tackle the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
